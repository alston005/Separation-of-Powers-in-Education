This article is part of Inc42's special year-end series -- 2018 In Review -- in which we will refresh your memory on the major developments in the Indian startup ecosystem and their impact on various stakeholders -- from entrepreneurs to investors. Find more stories from this series here.

""The value of an idea lies in the using of it."" -- Thomas Edison

The cup of ideas runneth over in the Indian startup ecosystem. A good idea is the genesis for any successful startup, but sometimes just having a good idea is not enough.

According to the findings of a survey by the Institute for Business Value and Oxford Economics, 90% of India's startups fail within the first five years. It added that the lack of pioneering innovation is the major reason for the failure of Indian startups -- in essence, they are copycats of startup ideas of the West, the study said.

Turns out, almost half of the Indian startups are actually not needed at all.

It is the absence of scalable ideas that makes 9 out of 10 Indian startups sink like lead balloons, despite the best intentions of founders and investors. The lack of originality is clear from this caveat -- Despite being the third largest startup ecosystem after US and China, the number of international patents India has applied for in 2015-16 was only 1,423 whereas Japan's count stood at 44,235, China at 29,846 and South Korea at 14,626.

This shows the clear mismatch between the number of startups mushrooming and the extent of innovation in the country compared to others.

As per Inc42's The State of The Indian Startup Ecosystem 2018 report, more than 10K Indian startups have shut their operations so far.

While failure is a hard pill to swallow, it is also a great teacher. For a startup founder, there is no bigger disappointment than seeing the product of their efforts come to nought. However there is also the flipside -- if you've never failed, you'll never know what works.

With 2019 just a couple of days away, we at Inc42 have compiled a list of the biggest failed Indian startups of the year. As late-night talk show host, Conan O'Brien said, ""Through disappointment one gains clarity and with clarity comes conviction and true originality""

Just Buy Live connected retailers to buy goods directly from brands across multiple categories such as food, drinks, personal care, auto, smartphones, fashion, stationery, etc. The startup also offered an unsecured credit lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to facilitate the transaction on its portal and provide working capital to small retailers. In August 2017, the startup raised $100 Mn (INR 699.25 Cr) Series B funding from a Dubai-based investment firm, Ali Cloud Investments.

Why it failed

Various reports claim that Just Buy Live may have shutdown due to an unscalable business model and negative cash flow. As per Entrackr's report in March this year, Just Buy Live's cofounder said that the company has temporarily been shut down and would resume operation after raising fresh funding. Its website is currently down.

Shotang was a business-to-business (B2B) online marketplace that connected retailers, distributors and manufacturers to discover, transact and manage their business online using their platform. Its main products were mobiles and apparel. It earned revenue through commissions paid by distributors per transaction.

Why it failed

At its peak Shotang had a $40 Mn (INR 279.7 Cr) market valuation. It had last raised $864K (INR 6.8 Cr) from Patamar Capital in February this year, and $5 Mn (INR 35.94 Cr) from Exfinity Venture Partners in December 2015. Techcircle cited an anonymous person saying that the money it last raised was ""primarily meant to pay off creditors, employees, partners. It tried but failed.""

It is likely that the business was forced to scale down its operation amid fierce competition from the likes of Flipkart, Amazon and Paytm Mall.

PortDesk provided an e-procurement software solution for logistics management for port-related operations such as accounting, cash management, ports DA estimate and voyage, layout and contract management.

Why it failed

In June this year, it was reported that PortDesk has shutdown its business, however, the reason is still unknown. Only a year earlier, the startup had raised $2 Mn (INR 13.98 Cr) in a seed funding round from a Singapore-based maritime services company, Alphard Maritime Group. The startup's founder Pushpit Pallav was not reachable for comments.

Undoubtedly India's largest crypto exchange, Zebpay (till its closure) enabled users to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, Ethereum, and Litecoin, or to purchase airtime and gift cards. According to its website, it had over 3 Mn users.

Why it failed

Zebpay decided to down its shutters in the aftermath of the circular issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on 6 April 2018, restricting banks and regulated payments companies from extending any services to crypto exchanges and wallets.

Many Indian cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as crypto groups, soon knocked the doors of the Supreme Court which, after multiple hearings, has listed the matter for further hearing in January next year.

However, amid the lack of crypto rules and regulations in India, Zebpay, on September 28, 2018 announced its closure. In a statement, it said, ""At this point, we are unable to find a reasonable way to conduct the cryptocurrency exchange business."" The crypto exchange, however, continues to allow users to deposit and withdraw coins/tokens into their wallet.

Since then, the situation has only worsened -- the founders of Unocoin, another leading crypto exchange, were arrested on October 23 by Bengaluru Police over a Bitcoin ATM installation.

Not only Zebpay, a slew of exchanges including Coinsecure, BTCXIndia, MoneyTrade, Bitconnect and more shut down for various reasons this past year.

Online parenting app Babyberry helped parents of a newborn baby to provide the best possible care for their child's holistic growth and development from physical, cognitive, social to emotional growth. The app included features such as digital vaccination chart and reminders, health records management and access to the nearest doctors based on geolocation.

Why it failed

It is uncertain as to what lead BabyBerry to shutdown its operations. Its website is pulled down, it hasn't posted any feeds on its social media since October last year, nor any queries to the founders could elicit any response. In August this year, a report had cited its founder saying that the startup is currently looking to solve technical errors on the platform after many of its customers reported the glitches. Notwithstanding, the startup had raised $1 Mn (INR 6.99 Cr) in 2016 meant for product development and marketing.

MrNeeds offered consumers an online subscription-based service for the delivery of products such as milk, bread, eggs, and other grocery items. In June 2017, ET had cited Wadhwa saying that its ""per delivery costs are 50% to 70% lower than the industry standard,"" and was serving 36K monthly orders for 9K families across Noida.

Why it Failed

The startup has pulled down its website, and is mobile application is not found anymore on Google's play store. It is, however, not clear as to what lead the startup to shut its operations. It is likely that the startup closed down its shutters amid fierce competition from the likes of BigBasket, DailyNinja, and others. Inc42's efforts to reach out to the founders have gone unanswered.

Bike rental startup Tazzo was focussed on point-to-point commuting service and charged INR 5 per km. Its mobile application was integrated using GPS technology and tracked every movement of its entire fleet in real-time, including overspeeding, theft, etc.

Why it failed

TheDearth of the follow-on funding was the main reason for Tazzo to shut down its operation. In October 2016, the startup had raised about $225K (INR 1.5 Cr) seed funding from DSG Consumer Partners, but the capital-intensive nature of the sector it catered too, and the lack of funding, forced the startup to halt its operation in September this year.

Trucks and logistics platform Ezytruk connected carriers, shippers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), to enable systematic transportation of goods. It offered services such as price comparison between carriers, real-time information of the goods, warehouse space management, etc.

Why it failed

Ezytruk had raised a seed funding of $147K (INR 1.02 Cr) from Dubai-based investors Ajith Nair and Anish K in January 2017. However, the startup could not scale and grow further as it was unable to raise further rounds of funding, reported Techcircle, which ultimately led the founders to shutdown the operation this year.

B2B wholesale marketplace Wydr offered a range of products across categories like fashion, home, automotive and electronics to manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. The platform allowed sellers to customise their requirements, negotiate prices, and instantly close deals. As at February 2018, the startup claimed to have added over 10K manufacturers and distributors across cities in India.

Why it failed

A report by Entrackr on November 3 cited ShopClues cofounder Sandeep Aggarwal and an early investor in Wydr as confirming the shutdown. The report said that ""the company (Wydr) was scaling down for the past three months and finally pulled the plug a couple of days ago."" An email query sent to Wydr did not elicit any response. Its official website (www.wydr.in) is currently pulled down.

Monkeybox provided Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) - approved vegetarian meals for kids in the age group of 3-18 at school. As on July 2017, the company claimed to be supplying over 1,500 meals per day to more than 85 schools in Bengaluru, with over 2K subscribers on its platform.

Why it failed

The Blume Ventures-backed foodtech startup shut down its operations amid much surprise and speculation. On one hand, the startup had been making quite a few acquisitions -- such as food delivery company 75 In A Box, juice delivery startup RawKing -- and, on the other, there was speculation that it was shutting down as it had failed to garner the required revenue to stay afloat amid fierce competition. On March 23, Monkeybox published a statement saying that ""the operation will be temporarily terminated.""

However, the termination was final. Its official website (www.monkeybox.in) was pulled down.

Apart from Indian startups that shut shop, there are some companies that ceased their operations in India after facing stiff competition and declining revenue. Here are the top top international companies whose India operations were shut down this year.

Walmart-owned ecommerce company Flipkart acquired the Indian arm of global retail company eBay in March 2017 for an undisclosed amount. Like any other ecommerce platform, eBay facilitates consumer-to-consumer and business-to-consumer sales through its website.

However, the big difference between eBay and the others is it enables trading on its platforms both in an auction or a fixed price sale. In a buyer's auction, buyers bid for a specific product and in a seller auction, different sellers bid their fixed price for a single product and the buyer chooses the best offer.

Why it failed

In May this year, eBay announced that it was ending its partnership with Flipkart and also forbade the latter to use the eBay.in brand. As the partnership ended, Flipkart migrated eBay India sellers and customers to its platform. Although being among the first players in India's ecommerce space, eBay couldn't actually rake in much revenue and faced fierce competition from Flipkart and Amazon.

As the company slowed down, and before Flipkart took over, eBay India had fired more than 350 employees from its Indian arm.

The reasons for eBay's failure in India have been many: the marketplace model was ahead of its time (eBay launched in 2005); there was no guarantee of product quality for either the buyer or the seller, and Indians never really warmed up to the idea of online auctions.

The company CEO, Devin Wenig, has announced eBay will be relaunched with a new business model in India.

The Alibaba-backed Chinese dockless bike rental company, Ofo, offered bicycles for rent on campuses and gated communities across New Delhi, Indore, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Pune, Coimbatore, and Chennai. At the time of announcing its India operations, the company claimed to have completed 1 Mn rides across seven countries.

Why it failed

Ofo's move to shut down its dockless bike renting service in India is part of company's strategy to scale down its operations in international markets, including countries such as Australia, Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, and Israel.

Ofo maintains that the move is aimed at remaining profitable. Techcrunch cited Ofo France general manager Laurent Kennel as saying that the company would focus on ""mature and promising markets"" such as Singapore, the US, the UK, France, and Italy. Moving forward, it is believed to be communicating with local markets about its plans.

Tapzo was an ""all-in-one"" app that used to aggregate more than 35 different apps in one place, across categories such as cabs, food, recharge, bill payment, news, cricket, horoscopes, and more. Tapzo's numbers were definitely impressive: 14,000 daily user base, 55K daily transactions, and an annual run rate (ARR) of INR 210 Cr in GMV/bookings.

Why It Failed

Tapzo's reduced valuation at its last funding round can be considered as a trigger towards its shutdown. Tapzo raised $1.9 Mn (INR 13.28 Cr) in December 2017 from existing investors RB Investments Pte Ltd and Ru-Net South Asia at a post-money valuation of $47.3 Mn (INR 308 Cr) -- nearly 50% less than its valuation in the previous round -- $85.54 Mn (INR 600 Cr).

Around mid of 2018, in August, the startup got finally acquired by Amazon. After the acquisition, Amazon has merged the entire Tapzo team with Amazon Pay, and it was working in the backend. Media reports said that Tapzo's founders are likely to get on board Amazon Pay's team in India.

HolaChef was a food aggregator that connected customers with chefs across the city, offering a new menu selection every day as per its website. Before shutting its operations three months back, the company was managing packaging, storage and delivery of the food.

Why It Failed

The startup was shut down around May 2018 amid a cash crunch. A media report in August has suggested that Kalaari Capital and India Quotient had already resigned from the board of directors of HolaChef earlier in the year.

With the increased dominance of players like Foodpanda, Zomato and Swiggy in the online food delivery market, investors lost interest in the startup. This was coupled with a market correction to make things worse. The last funding raised by Holachef was in February this year when it raised $28,602 (INR 20 Lakhs) in Series B round.

Foodpanda pounced on the chance, acquiring the startup for cheap -- the deal was said to fetch minimal returns HolaChef investors. For Foodpanda, the acquisition was an attempt to test waters in the cloud kitchen space, which its bigger rivals Swiggy and Zomato were already exploring.

A cursory glance at the startup shutdowns reported by Inc42 in the past three years shows that of the 32 startups that ceased their operations, most of them were from sectors such as consumer services, ecommerce, and fintech sectors. However, these sectors were among the top trending sectors in 2018, attracting investment, mergers, acquisitions, and new ventures. In fact, these are sectors that are expected to do better than all other sectors as well.

Goes to prove that it's not all about the idea, doesn't it?

What startups can learn from these stories is to buckle up their business strategy, take stock and identify even the most minuscule problems, and start rectifying them, immediately. They can also sleep on the fact that an idea -- or even market demand -- doesn't alone make a brilliant startup. It's also about execution and the right time, right place. As Edison also said, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.""

Update: Holachef and Tapzo have been acquired and not shutdown as was wrongly stated in an earlier version of this article."

But the past 12 months saw several incidents which, though making headlines at that time, slipped off public memory in months to come,

Most Passionate Fan

Diego Maradona: In a demoralising World Cup campaign, Argentina experienced fleeting jubilation with Marcos Rojo's 86th-minute winner against Nigeria. The happiest of them all was Maradona, who flipped double middle fingers at the hecklers seated below and almost fell over in the process. During the 90-minute journey of self discovery, the Argentine legend resembled the subject of Renaissance art. The 58-year-old unfurled a banner with a picture of himself as a saint, celebrated Lionel Messi's goal with a convulsive religious experience, fell asleep at halftime, danced with a Nigeria supporter, stumbled to the VIP lounge and was carried away by paramedics. AFP

The Cristiano Ronaldo worst footballer statue

Mo Salah: What is it with footballers getting the Avant-garde treatment in their home countries? The statue of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah unveiled in Egypt drew comparisons with the much-ridiculed bust of Ronaldo at the Madeira airport. The sculpture featured Salah in his trademark celebration, albeit with an oversized head and unusually short and skinny legs. ""I welcome all criticisms this statue received; this is natural because an artist is subjected to a number of tastes but I am personally not happy with the statue's final product,"" said artist Mai Abdel Allah.

Worst midfielder of the year

Manuel Neuer: Disciple of the Cruyff 'In my teams, goalie is the first attacker' school of Total Football, Neuer fancies himself as a bit of an outfield player. Seldom reckless, the keeper sweeps up to clear the ball and collect backward passes, enabling the backline to push forward. The chip over rushers, cheeky pull-backs, outside of the boot flicks and van Persie-style dives outside his penalty box have further added to his lore. So with defending champions Germany a goal down to South Korea and on their way out of the World Cup, Neuer decided to abandon his post in a Hail Mary attempt. Playing ahead of the two defenders, Neuer wandered aimlessly before squandering a throw-in with the heaviest of touches. Ju Se-jong swooped in, robbed the lumbering Neuer, spun back inside and launched a long pass towards the empty German goal. Son Heung-min did the needful as Neuer, a giraffe among deer, watched from 80 yards away.

Worst use of a pair of shoes

Advertising

After Nike revealed Colin Kaepernick -- the former San Francisco 49er quarterback who inspired the wave of player protest in the NFL -- as one of the faces for the company's latest ad campaign, many aggrieved customers went 'full Murica' and uploaded videos of sneakers and sportswear being set on fire while the Star Spangled Banner blared in the background. #IDontWearPolitics trended while Nike shares closed at record highs.

Honourable mention: French striker Olivier Giroud, who won the World Cup without a shot at goal.

Thinking outside the box moment

Khabib Nurmagomedov: Sometimes, winning a fight just isn't enough. Especially, a fight promoted by thrown dollies and shattered windows, mocked families and alleged terrorist connections. So after cranking megastar Conor McGregor into a lump at UFC 229, Nurmagomedov leapt out of the cage, onto the Irishman's outspoken trainer and into MMA folklore. The Dagestani, on a victory tour bordering on political puppetry since, recently spoke at a Q&A session in Saudi Arabia where he advised female fighters to ""be fighter inside your home"" and ""finish your husband.""

Unluckiest teammate of the year

Valtteri Bottas: The Finn couldn't catch a break this year. While Lewis Hamilton collected his sixth championship, Bottas failed to win a race. There was the last-gasp puncture in Baku and the loss of hydraulics pressure in Austria. The stinger came in Russia, when the team ordered him to move out of the way and let Hamilton pass for the win.

All-around performer of the year

Simone Biles: In January, Biles added her name to the list of nearly 160 women who spoke out about being the victim of sexual abuse by jailed US Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. In August, she won her fifth national championship wearing a teal leotard -- the designated colour to represent survivors of sexual abuse. And in October, a day after USA Gymnastics hired Mary Bono as its new president, Biles called out Bono for protesting Nike's association with Colin Kaepernick. Bono resigned less than a week into her job. At last month's World Championships in Doha, Biles fell off the beam during the all-around event, failed to stick the landing on the vault and stepped out of bounds on floor exercise, and still handily won four gold medals, and six in total; the 21-year-old was in hospital on the eve of the event due to complications from a kidney stone and competed without passing, what came to be known as, the Doha pearl.

Best counter-attack of the year

Virat Kohli: After his first series loss at Centurion in January, Kohli was getting an idea about the scrutiny a defeated Indian captain goes through. Quizzed if the team, which had failed to chase 287, was India's best XI, Kohli, part philosopher, part troll, fired back with ""What's the best XI?"" ""Was it your best XI?"" the journalist further pressed, to which Kohli responded ""But if we had won this, was this the best XI?"" Captain ended another testy exchange with ""Doesn't matter. Wherever we play, we try to do our best. I'm here to answer your questions, not to fight with you.""

Honourable mention: Belgium scything through Japan in less than ten seconds to win the Round of 16 clash 3-2

Best Indian cricket team in the last 15-20 years award

Virat Kohli and Co: ""I can't see any other Indian team in the last 15-20 years that has had the same run in such a short time,"" said national coach Ravi Shastri after India suffered its second straight series defeat, this time in England. Former captains and stats disagreed, but Kohli had his coach's back at a press conference. ""We have to believe we are the best side. Why not?"" said Kohli, before launching another counter-attack. ""What do you think?"" The reply was ""I am not sure,"" and Indian captain ended the chat with, ""That's your opinion. Thank you."" There might be something to the claim however, as India won their first Boxing Day Test in Australia and Kohli joined Sourav Ganguly as joint-Most successful Indian captain away from home.

The 2018 Tom & Jerry award

BCCI: The BCCI officials continued to disagree with the SC order. Vinod Rai and Diana Edulji, the two CoA, continued to disagree with the BCCI officials. Edulji didn't agree with Rai on the Rahul Johri #MeToo issue. Edulji said Johri's presence made all women in the BCCI uncomfortable. Rai didn't agree. When the committee cleared Johri, Edulji didn't agree. A BCCI official wanted to travel to Australia but both Rai and Edulji didn't agree. Rai and Edujli gave special status to Puducherry Ranji Trophy team, the BCCI officials didn't agreeing with them. Mithali Raj didn't agree with coach Romesh Powar. Captain Harmanpreet and Edulji didn't agree with Mithali. Rai didn't agree with Edulji on Powar being retained as coach. Edulji quoted the Virat Kohli-Ravi Shastri precedent but Rai didn't agree. Edulji didn't agree with Rai on forming a committee to pick a new coach. Johri got a legal opinion, Edulji, questioning his mandate, didn't agree. Meanwhile, Rai didn't agree with Edulji, and over-ruled her. Edulji didn't agree with Rai, asking who gave him the veto. Disappointed by this bizarre power tussle, Justice RM Lodha, the man whose reforms Rai and Edulji were brought together to implement, said, ""they were making a spectacle of themselves"".

Employee of the year

Cristiano Ronaldo: Ronaldo is being sued by a teacher from Nevada, who claims the footballer sexually assaulted her and then dispatched a team of 'fixers' to manipulate her into keeping quiet. It's an ongoing investigation, but employers Juventus issued a character certificate in October. ""Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus,"" tweeted the Italian club. ""The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.""

Reporter of the year

Shubhankar Sharma: At the World Golf Championship-Mexico in March, Phil Mickelson was busy honing his already formidable short game on the practice green when the five-time major winner was approached by a couple of -- or so he thought -- members of the media. With the business end about to get underway, Leftie curtly told them to buzz off and come later for interviews. Only, he soon realised, the duo was tournament leader Shubhankar Sharma and his caddie and former pro, Gurbaaz Mann. The mix-up was understandable as the 21-year-old Sharma, though top of the leaderboard, was making his debut on the PGA Tour. Mickelson apologised and got to know Sharma better when the duo paired up in the final round.

Worst inside scoop of the year

Jorge Mendes: With Manchester United free-falling under Jose Mourinho, the manager's all-powerful agent Jorge Mendes issued a rare statement to dissuade pessimism. ""There have been more rumours of Jose Mourinho leaving Manchester United. It's totally untrue. Jose is very happy at the club and the club is very happy with him,"" said Mendes, whose list of clients includes Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea. ""He has a long-term contract and is fully committed to the club in building a solid winning project."" Mourinho was sacked eleven days later.

Most anticipated press conference

David Warner: While a tearful Warner dodged questions regarding his specific involvement in the Sandpapergate that saw him stripped of vice-captaincy, slapped with a 12-month ban and removed from any leadership position with the national side for the rest of his career, a certain Englishman got all he wanted from the press conference. ""I literally stayed up until 1:30 in the morning to watch him cry live on TV. What a pleasure that was,"" said former England keeper Matt Prior, who had many run-ins with the Aussie opener.

Most confounding metaphor

Mauricio Pochettino: Asked to explain the pressures of Champions League football ahead of Tottenham's clash with Inter, Pochettino used a weird bovine analogy to set the moo'd. ""It is like a cow that every day in 10 years, sees the train cross in front at the same time. If you ask the cow, 'what time is the train going to come', it is not going to know the right answer.""

Overshadowing of the year

Naomi Osaka: After a remarkable tournament, Osaka outplayed a 23-time major champion to win her first Grand Slam at the US Open. But the presentation ceremony began amid thunderous boos and her acceptance speech with an apology. Serena Williams' outburst was a longtime coming, after the seeding and catsuit rows. But the timing, after three code violations, was unfortunate. Like Sam Stosur at the 2011 US Open, Osaka's first major victory will be remembered more for Serena's meltdown.

Comeback of the year

Omar Abdullah: A month before his retirement, Gautam Gambhir took to Twitter to chide politicians after the death of Manan Wani -- a research scholar-turned-terrorist. Former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir clapped back. ""This man wouldn't be able to find Manan's home district on a map much less his village & yet he presumes to know what drives young men in Kashmir to pick up the gun. Mr Gambhir clearly knows less about Kashmir than I do about cricket & I know almost nothing.""

Honourable mentions: Vinesh Phogat, Novak Djokovic, Tyson Fury and Tiger Woods.

Life-saving innovation

Halo: Received with skepticism at the start of the season, the ""ugly, annoying"" Halo device won over its harshest critics at the Belgian GP when it saved Sauber's Charles Leclerc from Fernando Alonso's McLaren. ""I have never been a fan of the Halo but I have to say that I was very happy to have it over my head today,"" said Leclerc. ""I felt the impact and looking at the image of my car it is quite spectacular.""

Head-scratching innovation

Bat flip: Big Bash League outdid itself this season after scrapping 'head' or 'tails' of a coin toss for 'hills' and 'flats' of a bat flip. And if you're a seasoned backyard cricketer who would favour 'hills' thinking that the bat will roll over, think again. ""You'd be surprised at the science that's gone into this. It is a specially weighted bat to make sure that it is 50-50,"" said head of BBL Kim McConnie. ""I'd also challenge people to say when was the last time anyone watched the coin toss or really focused on it to a great extent? Now we are making it much more relevant to families."" Nothing says wholesome family fun like chucking a piece of wood in the air.

Unreal moment of the year

Real Kashmir: Formed four years ago in the aftermath of the deadly Srinagar floods, the club reignited hope of the locals who have been battered by decades of violence in the Valley. In mid-2018, Real Kashmir won the second division league and became the first team from the region to qualify for the I-League. It wasn't the final frontier for Indian football, but when Real Kashmir kicked off the match against Churchill Brothers at Srinagar's TRC Ground, it felt like that. It was the first time a national league match was being played in the Valley. And in a breathtaking backdrop, Real Kashmir - the surprise co-leaders of the league - continued to script their fairytale.

Honourable mention: England win a penalty shootout.

Mary Kom: With eight quarterfinalists at the AIBA Women's World Championships, India looked set to record their best haul since 2006, which also incidentally were held in New Delhi. But when the dust settled, Mary emerged as the only one with gold around her neck, a record sixth world title. Spirited performances and favourable judging in their backyard yielded two bronze and a silver, but without Mary, the hosts would have ended with an egg on their face.

If you think that is enough to make a woman vulnerable and break down under responsibility, then consider the fact that she is Amita Sangma, the woman who was crucial in exposing the attacking mob in East Jaintia Hills and saving the life of CSWO president Agnes Kharshiing.

Dressed in traditional Garo dakmanda and a yellow top and a gamosa wrapped around her head to hide the marks of brutality, Sangma looks much older than her age. But the eyes set on the plump cheerful face burns every time she talks about the dreadful experience on November 8.

After coming out of the hospital, Sangma has been extremely busy looking after her children and talking to the media. She met Sunday Shillong in a small dim-lit Khasi eatery in Mawblei despite her busy schedule. ""I know this shop and the kong who runs it. I know all the people here,"" she said as she entered the shop followed by a bodyguard from police.

As she settled down for the interview she exchanged a few niceties with the lady in the shop and ordered milk tea and jingbam. ""Puchhiye, hum sab batayega (Ask me what you want to know and I will tell you everything),"" she said.

Sangma speaks broken English but she is fluent in Hindi, Garo, Khasi and Assamese. She also understands Bengali and speaks too, albeit not fluently.

Sangma is originally from Tripura's Dalai district. Her father had a temporary job as home guard there. Coming from a financially backward family, Sangma never had the privilege to complete school education. Later, she came to Shillong in 1991 and got married to NB Sangma, who worked in civil defence and home guard. But her life changed after her husband died in 2008. ""It was a struggle to run the family of eight. On top of that the pension that I was entitled to was also being delayed. I was at the end of my wits when I came to know about Agnes Kharshiing and knocked on her door for help,"" she narrated.

Kharshiing helped her get the pension and Sangma pledged her allegiance to her as a sign of gratitude. ""I do not remember in which year I started accompanying her. Maybe 2009. But since then I have been with her and accompanied her in every case,"" Sangma smiled and asked the lady in the shop for kwai.

It was a beginning of a journey for Sangma who, along with Kharshiing, saw the deception in the system and the despondency of those in need of help.

The two gritty women not only dealt with rape cases but regularly followed up illegal coal mining that continued even after the National Green Tribunal's ban order.

It was one such case that the duo went to follow up on November 8. But during their investigation, a mob of around 40 people attacked them and beat them up brutally. The attackers left the two inside a forest to bleed to death. However, it was Sangma's presence of mind that saved the duo and uncovered a bitter truth that was hitherto being denied by the government.

A grievously injured Sangma pretended that she was unconscious while the attackers were still hitting Kharshiing with logs. As soon as the mob found the two women unconscious they left them. When everyone left, Sangma, still writhing in pain, crawled out of the forest and cried for help. She managed to draw the attention of a police van and they were taken to a nearby hospital.

The story after this is known thanks to the numerous reports in the media, including at the national level. But how had Sangma felt at that moment when death seemed imminent?

""The driver of our vehicle pleaded with the attackers saying it was only a tourist car and he had no inclination of what was happening. I was inside the car when Agnes was speaking to Chullet (Nidamon Chullet, the prime accused in the assault case). Chullet wanted to speak to her but she refused and then came the blows. They kicked her. I came out and asked them not to hit her but I was attacked too. I could have fled. I could have requested them to leave me. But tell me why would I do that? Why would I leave her and run away,"" Sangma said, her voice now hardened.

Sangma sipped the remaining tea and showed the wounds on her hands. The scars were still fresh and two of her fingers have stiches and wrapped with pieces of cloth. ""The pain was excruciating. The hand still pains. Kong Agnes is recuperating but it will take time,"" she said and added that they had asked for security on the fateful day but police had refused saying there were only a few personnel on duty.

Though the attackers managed to cripple the activists temporarily, they could not dent their resilience, especially that of Sangma, who has been through many troughs in life. Despite the responsibility of the seven children, Sangma said she is not afraid anymore.

""God saved us and I thank Him every day for that. There is a purpose for which He saved us and that is to fight the wrong, to defeat the demons and to expose all those politicians who are ruining lives for money and vote,"" she said. ""I am ready to die but not before getting justice. My daughters would cry when they visited me in the hospital but I told them that I am still alive and stronger than before,"" she added.

The words of conviction flowed out of her mouth and for a moment one would think she was possessed by a supernatural power. But that is how she is. Loyalty comes as naturally to her as courage in the face of adversity.

Her expression changed when asked about her children and what do they feel about the incident. ""They are proud of their mother. They know I am fighting for the right cause. You know what my sons say? When they watch a Hindi movie, they say mother would have fought the villains and killed them. I would have indeed fought had there been one or two on that day but there were so many people,"" she said and smiled again. By now, her lips were red from the betel leaf juice and her cheeks blushing from the cold. Her youngest daughter Anisha, who is in Class III, is also proud of her brave mother. ""Her teacher told her that she would come and visit me. Her friends say they saw my photo in newspapers,"" the embarrassed mother now bursts out laughing.

Sangma's eldest son is 21 but he could not complete college due to financial problems and works as a mason. All her children are supportive.While the sons help her financially and guard her as much as possible, the three daughters help her with household chores. The penury does not make them weak but like their mother, they have learned to fight for their rights in society.

It was getting dark outside the shop and Sangma asked the bodyguard to leave but the young man insisted on staying, probably apprehensive about leaving his responsibility in the company of a stranger.

Sangma reluctantly started talking about her rented house in Mawblei. It is a tin-roofed old structure with four small rooms and surrounded by forests. ""I would have taken you to my house but you have to walk uphill for quite some time.""

The conversation again shifted to illegal coal mining, the tragedy at the mine, the surrender of Chullet and the slow police investigation. Sangma said she and Kharshiing had visited almost all the coal mines, mostly inside forests, in different places in Jaintia Hills like Lumthari, Saipung and Ladrymbai.

The small-time contract workers start work early, around 5am, and come out of the rat holes by noon. ""We can show every illegal mine there. How can the police and district authorities say they do not know anything when it is going on right under their nose,"" she said.

When asked about people struggling to earn their livelihood in absence of coal mining, Sangma said it was only a political gimmick and a lie that politicians were trying to sell.

""We have got complaints from poor locals who do not want illegal mining because it is ruining water quality and the environment. The entire Jaintia Hills will cave in if this continues. Who will die? Not the rich politicians and mine owners but poor villagers. The locals know the truth but are too scared to speak out. Rich miners threaten the poor and mine in their land,"" she informed.

She wondered why the police have not yet arrested the tea shop owner from whose shop the attackers took slices of wood to beat the women up. She also suspects that a particular NGO is conniving with the perpetrators. Though no threat calls have come so far, but Sangma gets unknown calls. ""Chullet was leading the mob. He was there and he knows everything. Police should get all details from him and arrest the remaining people, even those who are absconding,"" she beat the table to prove her point.

The bellicose woman is determined to fight for the rights of the poor because ""law cannot be only for the rich"". ""I might be illiterate but I can think and judge and differentiate between the right and the wrong. Working with Kong Agnes has opened my eyes and made me even more determined. If those in power think the poor do not have brains then they are wrong. Test our endurance and our capability and you will see what is there inside the skull and deep inside the heart,"" she said.

The fight has only begun and with a new year beckoning, both Sangma and Kharshiing are resolute to resume the long battle. ""I don't know how long it will take but we cannot trust a government whose leaders blatantly lie to people. If I die fighting, the government should take responsibility of my children because it is the one who failed its constituents,"" said Sangma.

It was the end of conversation as she had to rush home after buying groceries. It was time to be a caring mother of the seven lucky angels.

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

Ramesh, 60, who holds a PhD in library science, is due for retirement on December 31, 2018. He has also challenged the July 19, 2016 notification issued by UoM, prescribing 60 years as the age of retirement for librarians and library staff. The superannuation age of a teacher serving in a university is 62 while for librarians, it is 60. Vinayak B, counsel for the petitioner, argued that librarians guide PhD students, akin to the job of a teacher.

However, a closer look at the new conditions in fine print reveals that the part-time teachers may not be able to earn the assured sum even in entire year.

As per the GR issued by department of higher and technical education on November 14, the colleges and universities compulsorily need to follow a lengthy procedure to decide number of part-timers they require before appointing them. The new system has held up appointments for this year and is likely to disrupt teaching activity next year too.

Going by the GR, colleges and universities won't be able to assign work to part-time teachers before February. The university exam would start from February 15, thus leaving 15 lectures in 2018-19 session, experts say.

Earlier, the universities and colleges had the liberty to appoint CHB teachers in July itself and get approval by December from the department. Henceforth, the appointments can't be finalized until the government and universities okay the workload, which is decided only at September end when admissions close.

This year, colleges under Nagpur University (NU) as well as other parts of the state have been unable to recruit part-time teachers even though the second term of academic year has begun because of the draconian rules.

Surprisingly, several principals and aspirants have been unable to decipher the details of the GR which would entail months of unemployment and classes without teachers.

""People are so happy about the hike in remuneration that they didn't realize its drawbacks. The government is working against the interest of the students and teachers,' said Rajendra Bhoyar, president of Maharashtra Principals' Forum.

The biggest setback for teachers is restriction on working part-time in more than one college besides possessing higher qualification not less the PhD, NET/SET.

""This is injustice to teachers in the name of increasing the pay,"" said Anil Dhage, former secretary of NUTA.

He added that the GR restricts the number of lectures for a part-time teacher to 9. Earlier it was 7 but teachers were allowed to work in any number of colleges.

Bhoyar said imposing such norms not only increases unemployment among youth but also leaves students without teachers. ""At several colleges, no classes have been held so far. We have demanded that instead the government allows us to recruit contractual teachers just like the Nagpur University has done. We are ready to pay Rs25,000 a month to contract teachers,"" he said."

The 29-year-old, who has shown his work twice at the Lakme Fashion Week and was named one of the finest GenNext fashion designers, is content to work from Saharanpur and not move to a bustling big city. Mazhar justifies his choice by saying he finds his narratives and context here, he resists accepted notions of a high-profile career, and, above all, has the courage to put this small town on the fashion map of the country.

It all started when as a class nine student, Mazhar set up a boutique with his senior in school. The senior's father had a boutique.

In 2017, Mazhar's first collection, called Dhobi Ghat, evoked nostalgia about his hometown. The washerwoman Sakina Begum, a regular visitor at his home, used to make a small mark on the clothes. The whites of his collection had these marks that Sakina, along with 30 other women, pressed on to the clothes to make a design. The next collection used darn or the craft of the rafugars.

""My inspiration is the Indian artisan, especially those indirectly contributing to the fashion industry like the dhobi or the rafugar,"" he says.

Saharanpur is known for wooden handicraft and Mazhar's family is one of the many engaged in this business. ""Coming from a conservative Muslim family, it wasn't easy to say that I wanted to be a designer,"" he adds.

Today, he runs his label under the national rural employment guarantee programme and more than 70 people work for him. In his design, the visual language is distinctly made up of small-town life and the ways of the artisans there.

Rahul Mishra invokes his village, Malhausi, in his collections on display at the Paris Fashion Week. Just like Mazhar, nostalgia is the primary moving force in his designs too. The broken door, where his mother used to hang a white curtain with its daraz work filtering the afternoon sunlight symbolising a diffused state of being with those white curtains shielding him against the world. His intimate relationship with the things of his childhood-pillow cases, curtains, table cloth, the white of his grandmother's dhoti, the little pond, dew drops and the white and blue checks of the lungis of the weavers and the butchers in his sleepy village in UP-are all part of his storytelling as a designer.

While India's fashion story is shaped by designers who come from little towns and villages and set up shops in Delhi and Mumbai like Samant Chauhan, who is from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar, or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango, who hails from Mubarikpur, there is also another set of designers who are choosing to live and work in their small towns and reaching out to the world with their crafts via social media and e-commerce. Like in Kochi, Kerala, 32-year-old Sreejith Jeevan says he is moving towards ""unfashioning"" and it is the joy of slow-paced life that inspires his designs and collections. ""We're moving so fast that sometimes we have absolutely no time for little things such as raindrops and birds.

Though being far from the fashion capital of the country comes with its own drawbacks, there is nothing like the feeling of being home, doing the work you love in a place you know. ""Today, fashion is everywhere and is no longer limited to the metros,"" says Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, and then at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), Paris. He launched his label Rouka in 2013. ""My stories have a local flavour for a global audience,"" he says.

Dream Merchant: Jeevan at Origins, a collaborative project with locals to make designs for Chendamangalam Kaithari, a weaving cluster (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

After the devastating floods in Kerala this year, Jeevan, along with some other designers, helped the weavers of Chendamangalam, near Kochi in Kerala, who had lost their livelihood, get on their feet with the launch of Origins.

""How can my people make fashion for the world-that's what I ask myself,"" he says.

With sustainable fashion and craft becoming the buzzwords of the industry, it is no surprise that designers are looking back at their experiences and creating a new design vocabulary, along with social consciousness and an urgency to be innovative with local crafts and contexts. Take, for instance, Bihar-based social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan, who set up MATR-Motherly. Luxury. Artistry, a social enterprise in Bodh Gaya, his native place. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) alumnus collects discarded flowers from the Mahabodhi Temple and transforms them into natural dyes with Kathy Williams, who is from Australia and the founder of 'Because of Nature', a sustainable clothing label. Together, they have founded the Happy Hands Project. ""I always tell artisans that it is your right to expect from us. You are the people who kept our art, craft and culture alive. The artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity. So many people from other countries approach me to study traditional Indian textile and handicrafts,"" he says.

""Thousands of people visit the Mahabodhi Temple every day and offer hundreds of kilograms of flowers. Though this project is at its early stage, we have been able to employ 30 women from the surrounding villages,"" he says.

The Happy Hands Project is an initiative started as a collaboration between the Bodhgaya temple management committee, MATR and Because of Nature to bring sustainable employment to the people through natural dyes on khadi made in Bihar. The project aims to promote the skills of artisans to produce high quality khadi and garments for national and international designers and retail brands that utilise traditional skills.

People used to make fun of him, saying that he was studying tailoring at a high cost after joining NIFT. His father, a contractor, supported him against all odds. Today, Chauhan is credited with reviving khadi, along with other ventures.

Forty-eight-year-old Vijayalakshmi Nachiar grew up in a 'Kutchi' family and was introduced to the world of embroidery and textiles at a young age: Her family had been cotton traders for generations. She graduated in textiles and clothing from the SNDT Women's University, Mumbai.

After marriage, she moved to Pollachi on the outskirts of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, an agrarian town with a rich tradition of woven cotton sarees.

Her husband started growing ecological cotton through his contract farming initiatives in 2005. And, in 2008, Nachiar set up a handloom studio and co-founded Ethicus in 2009.

""I think I can do what I am doing today with Ethicus only because I come from a small town. This would have been impossible in a big city. I have an in-house production facility and local craftsmen work here. Living in a rural area has enabled us to work from farm to fashion,"" says Nachiar.

When they launched Ethicus, there were very few handloom brands and the challenges were many. ""Customers were willing to pay high price for silk but not for good cotton,"" she says.

Today, her venture is listed by the textile exchange as one of the few brands worldwide using 100 per cent sustainable raw material and adopting a sustainable method of production. It has been awarded the 'Future Shaper' prize by textiles exchange in 2012 and the 'Pride of Tamil Nadu' award in 2017, instituted by the Round Table of India, as an emerging retail brand.

Naushad Ali's story is similar. ""My dad was a textile merchant and I grew up with all kinds of fabric around me. We used to have bundles of fabric from all over India stocked up in our living room, and I used to help my father tag them all. That was my introduction to textiles and fashion,"" says Ali, 33. Unsure of being accepted as a designer, Ali gave himself five years when he launched his label at Puducherry. ""The lifestyle, landscape, culture and people I meet every day have all been great inspirations for the label and shaped me as a designer. 'Made in Pondicherry' has given me an identity in the industry,"" he adds.

""We are committed to being a sustainable label, with a difference. Being part of fashion, the second most polluting industry in the world, I want to take my decisions carefully and consciously-from the choice of materials to what we make out of them. I believe in slow fashion, creating something that lasts and is also something meaningful,"" he says.

Born in Vellore, Ali spent his growing up years in Chennai and Bengaluru, before his parents moved to Puducherry. He wanted to be an astrophysicist and was also good at botanical drawings. But once he got through NIFT, Chennai, he knew he would do something entirely different.

In 2014, he set up Studio Liam in Auroville to revisit and transfer the expertise of Indian craftsmen to contemporary fashion. His definition of fashion: there is no hurry, there are no seasons, there's only time and commitment. In 2017, three years after he launched his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Fashion Award (Sustainable Wear category). And in 2018, he was chosen to represent India for the first IFS biennale at London Fashion Week, 2019, supported by the London College of Fashion and Somerset House.

Pankaja Sethi, 39, spent her childhood at different places-from Itanagar to Chennai-as her father was the chief medical officer with the CRPF. A graduate in botanical science and a NIFT alumnus, after working for export houses, she was asked by a former teacher to help document the folk arts and narratives of Jharkhand. That was the beginning of her foray into indigenous textiles. She relocated to Odisha to help with design intervention and work with tribal weavers.

It was not an easy task to enrol artisans to create textiles because some of them had fallen in the trap of mass production and many of them did not want to create contemporary concepts, fearing it wouldn't last, she adds.

""Being located in Bhubaneswar, I now see the merits of living in a place that is pollution-free and with much less traffic on the roads compared to metro cities. Moreover, I am close to the weavers and the tribals, who create indigenous textiles and crafts. And, above all, I see the importance of local traditions at the global level,"" she says."

In June, Deepak Malghan, an associate professor with the Centre for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, made an unusual appeal to the institute's placement committee and environment club. The email - part request, part withering criticism - asked them to ""disinvite"" Hindustan Unilever from the job placements for management students in October.

In 2001, a thermometer factory owned by the corporation in Kodaikanal had dumped toxic mercury in the local environment of the popular Tamil Nadu tourist spot. The factory was subsequently shut. Earlier this year, activists alleged that the company's trial remediation of soil contaminated by mercury at the site in November 2017 had failed, possibly mobilising more mercury into the environment that it had recovered because it deployed a substandard process. They say that the company has refused to apply the standards follows in the United States. Hindustan Unilever has denied these claims.

The email was part of Malghan's larger mission to remind the Indian Institutes of Management, which are among the country's top business schools, of their responsibilities as public institutions even though they sit close to private business interests and influence. These institutes became degree-granting institutions with the passage of the Indian Institutes of Management Act in 2017.

""Disinviting them...will send out a powerful message that management institutions can actually walk the talk about corporate responsibility,"" Malghan wrote in his email. ""Disinviting Unilever from placements requires us to act like we are a real place of higher learning - with real students and professors in a classroom rather than customers and service providers. It requires us to act like a real university would - not like a glorified placement agency masquerading as a place of higher learning.""

Malghan's email elicited a ""censure order"" from the director of the institute on October 17 asking him to retract it. The note said Malghan must ""develop greater sensitivity"" towards colleagues and ""institutional stakeholders both internal and external"". Malghan retracted his letter on November 28 but ""under protest"" and after appealing to the board of governors. ""Thinking through the complex intersections between corporations, society, state, market, and the biophysical environment is an important learning objective for budding managers,"" he wrote. The retraction was shared with over 1,000 students. A week later, both the retraction and the original email became public.

This was not Malghan's first attempt to remind an Indian Institute of Management that it is a public institution. In 2017, he and doctoral student Siddharth Joshi co-authored a paper and a number of articles on the negligible social diversity among faculty members in the Indian Institutes of Management, arguing for affirmative action in the doctoral programmes that serve as a ""talent pool"" for faculty recruitment.

In the paper, Malghan had also criticised the culture of the Indian Institutes of Management to pay faculty members extra for a range of activities - such as conducting admission interviews - that in any other public university are standard academic functions teachers are expected to perform. The Indian Institutes of Management call such payments ""incentives"", but Malghan calls them ""bribes"". He has been unsuccessfully filing queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to obtain compensation structures of faculty of the Indian Institutes of Management.

In 2015, Malghan became the first ecological economist - studying the ""intersections between the human economy and the biophysical system that contains and sustains it"" - to win the VKRV Rao Prize, a top award for social scientists under 45. He has taught at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, his first faculty position, for nine years. He spoke to Scroll.in about the role of these institutes as public institutions, the response to his criticisms and what the institutes must do to arrest their decline into the role of a ""customer service provider"".

""Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists,"" Malghan said.

Edited excerpts follow:

Is there space for this form of activism in the IIMs? All professional education institutions seem to discourage it.

The short answer is that the limited space that exists is rapidly shrinking. My specific censure order is only symptomatic of much deeper structural problems. A more important question is should there be space for this form of activism, rather than is there space. The answer to this normative question is self-evident. What is a university that does not allow a free and open exchange of ideas? IIMs pride themselves as being crucibles for thought leaders - one of those vacuous terms that has its antecedents in the public relations industry. I think it is not the university's job to train shills for the elite. A university's mission ought to be to foster thoughtful individuals including voices of dissent.

Had you written about IIM policies before the paper you co-authored on faculty diversity? What prompted you to look at the IIMs?

My collaborative work with Siddharth [Joshi] is indeed the first time I have written publicly about IIM policies. The initial impetus for our work came from the fact that anecdotally everybody in the IIM system knew that IIMs have long been guilty of an unconscionable neglect of questions of diversity and inclusion in our doctoral programmes. The dubious methods used by IIMs to skirt constitutional and statutory mandates surrounding affirmative action were well-known internally. Like a lot of other contemporary Indian institutions, IIMs are an almost exclusively upper caste, and also mostly an urban upper class preserve. Based on imperfect data, we conservatively estimate that about 95% of all IIM faculty members are drawn from upper caste Hindu groups. Out of over 640 faculty members across 13 older IIMs, there are four faculty members from the SC [Scheduled Castes] groups and only one from ST [Scheduled Tribes] groups. The social composition of faculty at IIMs might as well have been produced by an apartheid regime.

Much of the credit for beginning this difficult conversation must go to Siddharth. Besides being a first-rate scholar, he is also a committed rights activist. I am a faculty member with tenure and really had little to lose materially. Siddharth was a graduate student yet to defend his dissertation when he first started work on the IIM social diversity project. Siddharth bravely withstood a variety of attacks and derision.

What was the response to the paper?

Initial reactions were predictable - when you are accustomed to privilege, any conversation on equity feels like oppression. As a sympathetic colleague pointed out, there was deflection. There was obfuscation. There was trivialisation. There were concerted attacks from colleagues ganging up. Finally, there was some personal vilification, too. Siddharth and I were largely able to tune out the negativity because there were a bunch of incredible colleagues and students across different IIMs who supported us in more ways that I can recount here.

Some among the IIM alumni have supported the sort of reform you have written about. Are there other faculty members who share your views?

I have to set the record right here. IIM alumni have not issued statements in support of the reforms that Siddharth and I have written about. If anything, we have reacted to enlightened alumni articulating the critical need for faculty social diversity at IIMs. If you have seen some limited reforms at most IIMs (except IIM Ahmedabad), the entirety of the credit must go to the global alumni network that has tried to remind us about Ambedkar's vision for the republic. The alumni have been at the vanguard of marginal changes (but revolutionary by IIM standards) that you have seen sweep the IIM system in the last couple of years

Siddharth and I have received some very important support from faculty members across IIMs. From over a dozen faculty colleagues that have openly supported us, I must single out Professor Mira Bakhru, a former faculty member at IIM Bangalore. Professor Bakhru was the first faculty member to write about social diversity deficit at IIMs. Many faculty colleagues around the country, across different IIMs have worked hard in the last two years to think through operationalising meaningful affirmative action in the doctoral programmes at IIMs.

What effect does this lack of diversity have on teaching, research and students?

The most important diversity that must be treasured by a university is intellectual diversity. I do not wish to suggest that intellectual diversity is somehow correlated with social diversity (ethnicity, gender, etc). However, there is strong evidence that a diverse faculty and student body with varied life experiences are crucial to the educational mission of a modern university. Actually, the IIM leadership recognises how diversity contributes to better outcomes for students and faculty alike. It is only that not all diversity axes are created equal. For example, IIMs have made tremendous progress on the gender diversity front at all levels - MBA students, doctoral students, and most significantly faculty body. However, there has been more reluctance to extend the gains from increased gender diversity to say social group diversity. Caste is the most significant axis of social heterogeneity in India, not to mention the most pernicious axis of stratification. Unfortunately, much of the reluctance to address deep-seated caste inequities can be attributed to a wholly misguided and indefensible notion of meritocracy that smacks of entrenched privilege.

In the two-year MBA programmes, however, IIMs do admit a very socially diverse class. But students from historically underrepresented sections of India do not find role models in their classroom. I can bet that a class on infrastructure management is going to look very different if the faculty body had adequate representation of Adivasi and Dalit groups who have borne the brunt of a rapacious infrastructure industry. Instead we now have classes on infrastructure that are taught by faculty members who serve on boards of crony capitalist firms. For example, at IIM-B [Bangalore] the infrastructure management class is taught by somebody who is on the board of an Adani company.

Finally, IIMs are elite public institutions with considerable normative influence on the national discourse. It is unconscionable that elite institutions are as skewed as IIMs are in terms of their social representation. This problem is not unique to IIMs or even to public universities in general. For example, my own guess is that the social composition of elite media houses is as skewed as IIMs. Some of the duplicity surrounding affirmative action policies including reservations at IIMs stem from misconstruing affirmative action as a welfare or poverty alleviation measure. Affirmative action at elite institutions is anything but. It is about representation at the elite decision-making tables.

You point out that IIMs have demanded autonomy but not exercised it for ""critical engagement with business practices"". In which direction do you see the institutions going under the new IIM Act passed last year? The new law has granted even greater autonomy to the institutions.

Yes, egged on by a consumptive urban upper class, the IIMs have used the unprecedented autonomy granted to these institutions (even before the new Act) for largely self-aggrandisement. IIMs do not see themselves as enlightened public universities. Autonomy for IIMs has largely meant abdicating their social contract as a public university. The social diversity deficit at IIMs is only one of the most egregious symptoms of these institutions abandoning their public mission. I believe the new Act will only exacerbate this trend even though it also provides a framework to recover the public mission. The litmus test for any university is this: does it use the autonomy to promote an environment where the life of the mind is nurtured and treasured? Available evidence suggests that IIMs fall short of this ideal by quite a bit.

You have mentioned the ""powerful faculty bodies and board led by corporate honchos"" that run the IIMs. How have they - and IIM-Bangalore in particular - responded to your criticism?

Individual colleagues and many students have supported or at least defended the exercise in self-criticism. The leadership has been much more, shall I say, sceptical if not hostile. Of course, several colleagues have also been very critical and a colleague has even described me as being obnoxious and a hypocrite. In general, the intellectual culture at IIMs (and I can speak most authoritatively only about IIM-B) is not open to critical inquiry. The problem is structural. Business school academia is focused not on understanding the world but on manipulating it. IIMs really are not an exception. Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists. Quite often it is the case of not being able to criticise the very hand that feeds you. When students are reduced to fee paying customers, the professoriate has to debase itself into a customer service provider guild. The only exception to this otherwise bleak picture that I have painted is the doctoral programme that has been my refuge.

Why did you describe faculty members receiving incentives for research as ""bribes""? How did your colleagues react to this?

Many of my faculty colleagues have been upset with Siddharth and I going to town with IIMs' worst kept secret - the fact that faculty members at these institutions need special incentives to write academic papers, and ""upset"" is putting it very mildly.

There are three fundamental problems. First, we have made a fundamental category error - incentives and integrity are two very different objects. The idea that you can fix what is fundamentally an integrity problem with incentives betrays a certain kind of studied illiteracy. How can a professoriate that is so confused about incentives and integrity lecture in an MBA classroom about business ethics? If faculty have to be paid to do admission interviews, we really cannot complain about MBAs that are paid those vulgar bonuses to run the casino economy.

The immediate corollary of this category error is that faculty demand to be bribed to do anything at all - from reading and writing to admission interviews and supervising master's thesis project. An improved incentive structure will do nothing to fix this fundamental flaw with our system. Unless we recognise that we cannot bribe our way into making up for our original sin - jettisoning our innate integrity - we are doomed. Yes, we need a set of shared norms but not metrics that reduce the deans at IIMs wholly into a bean counter.

Second, IIMs are a public university - at least in theory. We have (if only an implicit) social contract with the Indian republic. Our current compensation arrangements are in breach of this compact. Every major public university (including business schools at public universities) has an open and transparent faculty compensation structure. Unless we are willing to publicly defend who and what we pay ourselves, the present regime is simply illegitimate. In the past few months I have filed several RTI [Right to Information] requests at various IIMs asking them to reveal their faculty compensation structure (the generic structure) but all of them have come up with the flimsiest of reasons to deny this information.

Third, we are a faculty body that has lost any sense of proportion. At a public university, compensation structure ought to be benchmarked against the means of the larger society. We are being non-transparent about our compensation structure because we are paying ourselves incentives that are patently indefensible. We may come up with any number of excuses to pay ourselves. My favourite is the one offered by several colleagues - we need to pay ourselves because we now aspire to send our children abroad (read Western university) for undergraduate education. We are perfectly within our rights to harbour such aspirations but it is not any Indian public university's remit to pander to these aspirations.

It takes a certain kind of entitlement to believe that being on 98.4 percentile of the income distribution in our country (this is at the beginning assistant professor level) as a public university teacher means living a life of abject poverty.

How has your own experience at IIM-Bangalore been?

On the balance, my time at IIM-B has been most fulfilling. I must especially single out the superb doctoral programme at IIM-B that has provided me an opportunity collaborate with, and learn from young scholars in disciplines ranging from social anthropology to hydrology. The dozen or so doctoral projects that I have been involved with have been the most important source of intellectual sustenance at IIM-B. Doctoral programmes at IIMs operate outside the din and media glare associated with the bread-and-butter MBA programme. While much of the IIM system is focused on celebrating corporate titans of the world, I have been happy to inhabit a much less glamorous space that has produced many outstanding scholars."

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

He recalled late Chief Minister Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy's efforts in building the Vamsadhara project in the district.

Launching a scathing attack Chandrababu Naidu, YS Jagan said despite the TDP, along with Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, being partners of the NDA in Vajpayee government, Chandrababu failed to resolve the issue.

In February 2005, Dr YSR inaugurated the Vamsadhara project and the Hiramandalam reservoir, putting an end to 55 year old dispute. In his tenure, Rs 930 crore were allotted for the project works. Of the allotted funds, Rs 720 crore were spent when he was alive.

The YSRCP chief said Chandrababu could not even complete the remaining Rs 55 crore worth project works. Instead, Chandrababu conspired to make money by escalating the project costs to Rs 420 to benefit his benami contractor CM Ramesh.

In Rajanna Rajyam, six canals, including the Jumuluru, Polaki and Bairi canals were merged into Vamsadhara. If YSRCP comes to power, the Vamsadhara and Naidupeta Barrage would be completed, he promised. Due to Chandrababu's misuse of power, 6,000 acres of land was affected. I feel proud to say that Dr YSR had built over 38,000 houses in this constituency, he added.

YS Jagan asked the locals if Chandrababu's 2014 promises of making the Rajam river a tourist attraction, drinking water to Jagannadhapuram in Narasannapeta, Ring Road, Saravakota mandal lift irrigation project, another PHC in Saravakota mandal and the railway over bridge in Janamuru mandal were implemented.

In this constituency 36 schools and 3 hostels were closed down in the last four years. YS Jagan said the YSRCP would give the 3,400 crore loss caused by cyclone Titli after coming to power. In Chandrababu Naidu's rule, the Titli cyclone incurred crop and property loss, but, not even a single rupee was given to the district. Till now, the State government released only Rs 520 crore towards relief activities.

Chandrababu's Heritage company purchases crops for a lower price from farmers and sells its products for 3-4 times the price, YS Jagan said.

In view of the expected election schedule in February and the elections in April, ""I urge everyone to think over the dire situation in the State"", he said.

YS Jagan said that women's self-help groups were cheated by Chandrababu. The YSRCP President said that in the name of loan waiver, Chandrababu had cheated the state to the tune of Rs 87,000 crores. It was not clear if the farmers got back the gold which they mortgaged in the banks, but they had got the bank notices for sure, he commented.

The YSRCP Chief informed the public gathering that Chandrababu had after promising to give Rs 2,000 to every household without employment. But with few months to go for polls, the TDP got away with providing Rs 1,000 per month to a few students while the 23,000 teacher posts were lying vacant in the State.

He pointed out that the women's self-help groups were also cheated and were not given loan waivers. The AP CM promised to build a house for every poor man in the state -- how many houses has he built till date?"" he asked.

The Polavaram project became a centre of corruption. In the last four years, only the foundation walls were built. But, the TDP leaders are claiming to have completed the construction. ""Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu's relative was awarded the contract works in Polavaram project,"" he said.

Could Chandrababu build the Amaravati capital city in the last four years? In Chandrababu's rule, the electricity charges, fuel prices, RTC bus charges, house tax , school fees etc. have skyrocketed. Chandrababu, who promised to provide nine hours of electricity to farmers, did not keep his word. Besides, the TDP is collecting huge revenue in the form of electricity bills, he said.

""The YSRCP government will provide Rs 15,000 per year to all mothers with school-going children, Rs 20,000 for hostel allowance to students in addition to the complete waiver of college fees. Under YSR Cheyootha scheme, women would be able to draw loans without hassles like bribes,"" he said to the public.

If YSRCP comes to power, the Arogyasri scheme, which saved many lives during Rajanna Rajyam, will be reinstated along with the 108 ambulances which had saved many lives under YSR rule, he pointed out. The 108 vehicles used to reach the patient within 20 minutes of intimation, he said. Rajanna Rajyam had an ambulance per mandal while today, not even a single ambulance is available per constituency, he remarked.

In 2014, Chandrababu vowed to ban all liquor shops in the state. But, after four years years of his rule, he has ensured that every village had a liquor shop, YS Jagan said.

Chandrababu proposed to forge an alliance with the TRS and after KTR rejected the offer, he went to New Delhi to join hands with the Congress. On 8 June, 2018, the Congress released a book on Chandrababu's corruption and failures. Within few months from the release, the people of Telangana gave a mandate that was a slap on the face of the Congress and TDP.

The TRS said it would enter Andhra Pradesh politics after Rs 140 crore belonging to the TDP were caught during the Telangana elections. Chandrababu, in response, reacted like a chameleon, raising the issue of the Special Category Status this time around. ""How could Chandrababu ask KTR for an alliance with TRS during the last rites of former MP Nandamuri Harikrishna?"" he asked.

YS Jagan explained the benefits of YSR Cheyootha scheme in Navaratnas. Through Village Secretariats, transparency, efficiency and employability would be improved in the State's governance, he said. Ration cards, ration supplies, pensions, unemployment allowance and other government benefits would be delivered to the homes in YSRCP rule, he asserted.

The sad news shook the conscience of those in academia who resorted to social media to discuss the legal and ethical aspects of private educational institutions withholding certificates. It is learnt that a few of them even wrote to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) highlighting the problems encountered by employees who struggle to get their certificates back when they need to move to a better job. The impact is that now the AICTE has issued a public notice stating that it is illegal and unethical to withhold employees' certificates. It has even issued a warning that it would withdraw the approval given to the colleges that flout the rule.

Violating rules

Most private educational institutions (schools, technical institutes, colleges, deemed-to-be universities, and so on.) retain their staff's academic certificates at the time of issuing employment contracts to them. Some institutions collect all the certificates including mark sheets and retain them, making it really hard for the staff to apply for any other job during the academic year. It is true employees have a tough time recovering their certificates from their employers in many educational institutions, when they decide to quit their jobs. Many have to forego their better prospects as they are not able to recover their documents in time.

Is this problem unique in India? Yes, it seems to be. I worked abroad for five years. At the time of recruitment, my certificates were verified by the Educational Consultants India Ltd (EdCIL), Noida and during my service at the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management, Rwanda, my academic certificates were quite safe at home in India. There were over 50 expatriates at the Institute and there was not a single case of anyone quitting the job without proper notice.

Indians who run educational institutions in Gulf countries retain all the original documents including the passports of expatriate staff. I have heard numerous tragic stories of Indian expatriates working in Indian schools who could not visit India when their presence at home very much needed. Isn't withholding one's passport a human rights violation? Yes, it is.

Is it a good practice to withhold teachers' academic certificates and other original documents? Why do educational institutions indulge in such practices? I discussed this issue with some heads and administrators of some private educational institutions. A Principal of a well-known school said, ""We retain the certificates of our staff only for security reasons. We do face problems when a teacher quits our school in the middle of an academic year. To prevent them from quitting we have to keep their original documents with us."" When I countered her with the question whether it would be difficult to find a replacement for anyone who resigned if the institution paid a competitive and decent pay to the staff and created a good working environment for them, she just flashed a smile. Yes, finding a suitable replacement is not at all difficult as there are many well-qualified and good teachers waiting for well-paid jobs.

Make changes

Here is a different view. Another head of an educational institution said, ""Teachers should not be treated as bonded labourers. Instead of keeping possession of any teacher's original documents and certificates, educational institutions should issue employment contracts in which all terms and conditions are clearly specified. The contracts are signed by the employer and the employee and be honoured by both the parties.""

When teachers serving in government educational institutions and employees working in companies keep their original certificates with them, why shouldn't those who work in private educational institutions be allowed to keep their original documents with them? The fact that there are some rare cases of teachers absconding should not make employers distrust every teacher. Academic certificates are the intellectual property of those who have received specific education after years of study and hard work. Therefore, the certificates should be with the owner and not with anyone else.

Employers can always state that they retain the certificates of employees with the latter's consent. If there is a rule which specifies clearly that even with the consent of employees, employers should not keep possession of employees' academic certificates, then employees will be safer. In the absence of such enforcement of laws, employees will have to be at the mercy of their employers.

Employers need not keep possession of any employee's certificates for these reasons: i) Employees are at the receiving end because they have to get service certificates from the employer. At times, the employer serves as a referee when any employee quits the organisation and joins some other organisation. ii) If the employee has signed an employment contract s/he has to abide by the terms and conditions in the contract and legal action can be initiated by the employer against any employee who violates the contract. iii) No employee will dare to quit an organisation without proper notice because s/he has to get many other formalities completed before joining another organisation.

Retaining good teachers and not retaining the academic certificates of teachers should be the motto of educational institutions. Certificates are the intellectual property of those own them. Retaining the certificates of employees is akin to depriving them of their rights to own their property. It is true employees need jobs and at the same time employers need employees. Without employees, the word ""employer"" is meaningless. Both employers and employees are mutually dependent on each other. Employees need not be at the mercy of employers. Good employers make employees feel that they are co-workers and not servants. Therefore, they should have mutual trust and respect for each other.

Employers should be benevolent and happily bid farewell to any employee who decides to quit their job in order to move on to greener pastures. When will our educational institutions show such a gesture of goodwill?"
