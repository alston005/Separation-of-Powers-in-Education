Stagecraft, the theatre company found by him in 2003 has been consistently feeding city's craving for good quality plays.

Khurana studied theatre under the tutelage of Satyadev Dubey in Mumbai. ""But when I returned to Nagpur in the nineties there was a vacuum,"" he says.

""A few of my friends then began to get together and we rehearsed some scripts and would perform strictly before friends and relatives. And as many of my friends were either Parsees or Christians the plays were mostly in English and were performed at the auditorium of Tata Parsee School,"" he adds.

As the word got around and audience came in, Khurana and his theatre group began to charge a nominal amount of Rs10 as ticket fee. ""That was the time when we began to look at theatre a bit more seriously. Some of the plays produced by us were in demand by schools who wanted to stage them as fund raisers,"" says Khurana.

Around the year 2003, Khurana felt the need to formalize his working structure and stagecraft was formed. Today the 15-year-old theatre group has staged 75 plays in the city and have travelled with many of their productions.

""Way back when we began with Stagecraft, the scene was dismal. Finding actors was difficult and parents were weary of sending their daughters for rehearsals which usually took place in the evenings,"" says the actor and director of many plays.

""But as the audience grew aspiring actors and directors expressed a desire to join us. That was the time I began taking theatre workshops as many parents felt that doing theatre would help in enhancing the personality of their ward and give them the required confidence,"" says Khurana who can rightfully claim credit for training more than 350 boys and girls as actors, writers and directors.

Though Stagecraft was initially known for the English plays but lately quite a few in Hindi too have been coming from the group. ""If you ask me theatre has no language and in this city of which Mahesh Elkunchwar is a resident, Marathi theatre is very evolved. In fact, the first Hindi play done by us was an adaptation of Elkunchwar's Pratibimb. He gave me the Hindi translation done by Vasant Deo and in 1999 we for the first time organized five-day theatre festival in Nagpur where five plays in three languages were staged. That kind of set the tone,"" Khurana adds.

With so much behind him, Khurana says he would now like to set new targets. ""The thinking caps are on. Our Adda has been a success and we have been staging plays very consistently. Now we need to do something different, maybe present ourselves in a new avatar,"" says city's theatre guru."

Following complaints that some transport agents engaged for delivery of rice under the scheme in Bhadrak and Keonjhar districts are diverting the food grain for purposes other than providing supplementary nutrition to school children, the State Food Commission had sought immediate intervention of the Government.

Since corrective measures were not taken promptly, as normally expected, the Food Commission moved the Finance department with a request to conduct a special audit into the allegations on a priority basis.

The special audit suggested recovery of '1,888.72 lakh from officials concerned as bulk of the amount relates to short delivery of MDM rice by two transport agents. ""The audit report clearly brings out the gross misconduct and indifference of the District Education Officer (DEO), Keonjhar and other Government employees,"" said a letter of State Food Commission Chairperson Ranglal Jamuda to School and Mass Education department.

The audit found excess consumption of MDM rice by one Manna Trust over and above the requirement. The cost of the excess rice used was estimated at '6.53 lakh. While shortage of rice stock worth '4.4 lakh was detected, the audit has recommended for recovery of '9.24 crore towards non-realisation of sale proceeds of empty gunny bags.Jamuda requested the department to take exemplary action against the culprits in the larger interest of school children."

The Victorian era brick-built double-storey structure in the classical Western style of Doric-Corinthian column has undergone careful restoration keeping in mind the unique visitors and guests. ""The modern and luxe design of its interior contrasts the ancient and ornate architecture of its exterior making the property and its surroundings a walk through the annals of history,"" directors of the palace Akshita and Mrinalika said.

The Bhanjadeo sisters roped in Delhi-based interior designer Pooja Bihani for the elaborate transformation of the palace. The original 25 rooms and space were redesigned to accommodate 10 luxury suites, conference rooms, an extended library, billiards and theatre room, extended dining table, rooftop for performances, gymnasium, spa, museum with a few additional verandas, for a multi-faceted curated experiential heritage stay, said Akshita, who formerly worked with the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid organisation focusing on the Syrian refugee crisis.

The walls have been adorned with terracotta flowers and nature imagery that was brought out by carving the original designs from the walls. Gold leafing, miniature paintings, large canvas and oil paintings, and beautiful murals were restored with their frames besides, gargoyles and French window frames were repainted and fitted to mellow down the tone of the Victorian architecture with the re-modelled 1920 French designs. Also, remnants of weapons used in World Wars I and II by allied soldiers who were stationed at the palace have been cleaned and restored for showcasing in the museum along with State canons and original silk flags with the State emblem.

The palace, however, is not just the only attraction for travellers. With an aim to build a sustainable tourism model having social impact, the sisters have decided to offer tourism add-ons like visit to tribal villages where villagers practice Dokra, black stone carving, Chhau martial dance and the Similipal National Park. A part of the profit from this venture will go towards socio-economic development of the artists and promotion of the art forms that were patronised by their ancestors.

""Tourists can also visit Haripur which was the original palace of the Bhanja kings. The vast ruins afford ample and interesting material for antiquarian research. It was named after the Maharaja of Mayurbhanj, Harihar Bhanja who founded this place as the Capital in 1322,"" said said Mrinalika, who is also successful yoga practitioner and facilitates spiritual retreats in India and abroad."

Officials of the state education department said the move is aimed at promoting patriotism among students from an early age. ""When I was a student, it was compulsory for me and other students to confirm attendance by saying Jai Hind/ Jai Bharat. The practice was later discontinued.

The state also ordered that don Atiq Ahmad, a former MP, be shifted to the high-security Bareilly district jail.

The suspended jail officials are deputy jailor Deo Narayan Yadav, head warden Munna Pandey and warden Rakesh Sharma. Inquiry has been initiated against jail superintendent DK Pandey and jailor Mukesh Katiyar.

The moves came swiftly after Deoria DM Amit Kishore and SP N Kolanchi raided Deoria jail late Sunday night after real estate dealer Mohit Jaiswal filed an FIR on December 28 that he was kidnapped from Lucknow and taken to Deoria jail where he was assaulted by jailed don Atiq Ahmad and his aides and forced to transfer his business to them.

DM Amit Kishore told reporters on Monday, ""We found CCTV recording had been tampered. DIG Gorakhpur is investigating the matter separately. I've constituted a senior team to probe each aspect of the matter..."".In his complaint to police, Jaiswal had said the former MP extorted lakhs of rupees from him in the last two years.

'Jaiswal should've been taken to scheduled meeting place'

Jaiswal said that Atiq's aides Farrukh and Zaki Ahmad came to his office in Gomtinagar two months ago and forcibly included their names in his firm and took his and his sister's digital signatures. Jaiswal and his sister are directors of the firm.

On December 26, around 6.30am, Farrukh, Zaki and accomplices kidnapped Jaiswal and took him to Deoria jail in an SUV. Atiq Ahmad, his son and 20 others were present in his barrack.

They tortured Jaiswal and broke two fingers of his right hand before making him sign documents transferring the firm in the names of Farrukh and Zaki. They made him forge his sister's signature and then dumped him near his house.

Jaiswal first got treated in hospital then filed a complaint with Krishnanagar police accusing Atiq Ahmad, his son Umar and five aides of kidnapping, thrashing, and threatening him.

Additional Inspector General (AIG) Prisons Sharad told TOI that the report of preliminary inquiry found lapses on the part of three officials. If it were a ""meeting"", ""Jaiswal should have been taken to the scheduled meeting place and not to the individual's barrack where he was allegedly assaulted. It was the responsibility of deputy jailor Deo Narayan Yadav to ensure that visitors are not taken to the barrack. Pandey and Sharma were wardens of the barrack where Ahmad was lodged. The detailed report is awaited,"" he added.

Poornima Joshi reports

Neelabh Dubey is a young tax lawyer whose Twitter account recommends the latest works by new-age left-wing economist and former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. It celebrates Justice S Muralidhar's landmark judgement convicting Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by posting a video of the dogged champion of the victims' cases, human rights lawyer H S Phoolka, after the pronouncement.

It would have been difficult to imagine this left-leaning lawyer in the dirt and scum of electoral politics if it wasn't for the testimony -- the manifesto Dubey and a team of spirited party workers produced for the Congress in Chhattisgarh in the just-concluded Assembly elections.

Dubey worked with the Congress veteran TS Singh Deo for over six months, travelling in each district of the tribal State, to listen to one lakh people to produce this document that envisages universal health care, a spurt in State expenditure on health and, of course, steps to boost agricultural income in the years to come.

Driving his personal car to remote areas in Bastar, Dubey's sole focus was to push the Congress's stuttering organisation and cadre base to recognise what he feels should be focus areas for a more pro-poor policy planning.

""It would have been strange even for me to think of working with the Congress. But if we are thinking of change, we cannot just talk about it. We have to work with the existing realities and one of these realities is that we don't have a viable political alternative beyond the Congress and the BJP. I can't imagine working with a regressive force like the BJP so that leaves me with the Congress. And here I am, for what it's worth,"" says Dubey.

A tangible result of this work is the Christmas Eve announcement by the Chhattisgarh government that 1,764.61 hectares of private land, owned by 1,707 tribal farmers in Bastar region that was acquired for a Tata steel project that never took off is now going to be returned to their owners.

""We're not doing them a favour. This is the law of the land. This is what we promised to the people,"" says Dubey, whose singular focus in the coming months is to push the Health Ministry, now under TS Singh Deo's charge, to implement the Universal Health Care model that people so urgently need.

At the dawn of the New Year, which will witness general elections in the summer, the hope and promise that candidate Narendra Modi ignited in his election as Prime Minister in 2014 has seemingly dissipated in his party's loss in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan that sent as many as 62 MPs to the Lok Sabha of the total 65 parliamentary seats in these Hindi heartland States.

But a microscopic look at who and what contributed to this change in the national mood indicates India may still surprise the prophets of doom with its intent to reinvent even a structure so decrepit and symbolic of the rotten state of affairs as the Congress.

Short of churning, there's now a sense of fluidity in the political system, brought upon by a polity that never loses hope.

From the inspired bunch of activists who have thrown their lot for building public education system in Delhi with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s formidable duo -- Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and the young firebrand Aatishi Marlena who is set to contest the East Delhi Lok Sabha seat -- to former President of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)'s student union Sandeep, who is quietly working with the Congress President Rahul Gandhi's team, and Akshay Labroo who was prompted by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman -- with whom he worked as a trainee fresh out of his graduate year from Ramjas college -- into breaking through to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) this year, politics in India is decidedly being changed by the young and the hopefuls.

They frame the social media discourse and pose certain questions to structured corporate or big business channels who tend to guide mass media and television discourse in a certain direction.

Without an exception, they all believe that Indian elections, including the recent Assembly polls, reflect the common voter's aspiration for a change in status quo and a hope for the future.

2014 was, as BJP leader Sudhanshu Mittal, himself a committed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activist in his time, told BusinessLine during the last general elections, a ""Year of Hope"" for India.

""Narendra Modi has the hope factor riding with him. You cannot compete against that in India,"" Mittal said.

The country decidedly voted against the Congress but it also voted positively for Modi's promise of Achche Din, earning the BJP a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time for a government in three decades. The PM carried this momentum into successive elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand where the BJP swept to power soon after the Lok Sabha elections in 2014.

And then came Arvind Kejriwal whose promise of change swept out the Congress and reduced the BJP to just three seats while the AAP won a staggering 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections in February 2015, just months after the Lok Sabha polls.

Nitish Kumar's track record in governance, coupled with Lalu Prasad Yadav's caste arithmetic, again broke the Modi spell to bring the Mahagathbandhan to power in Bihar Assembly elections later in 2015. In all these elections, the ebb and flow of hope floated with the leader who showed a promise for the future.

If the young participants in the dynamic process that is direct elections are to be believed, what transpired in the December 2018 Assembly polls is a reflection of the popular disenchantment with the promise of Achche Din and guiding of the discourse towards issues of livelihood and economy.

People have spoken, says the suave Raghuvendra Mirdha, a graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) who quit an international commodity trading company to join his famous grandfather Ramniwas Mirdha's party, the Congress, in Rajasthan. He says that issues such as rural distress, prices of farm produce, erratic MGNREGA payments and glitches in Aadhaar-linked benefit transfers have propelled voter behaviour against identity politics, cow slaughter and Ram temple in Ayodhya, being pushed by the BJP.

In the face of discontent with the Centre's policies and the vast difference between what Modi promised in 2014 and what has actually been delivered on the ground, the BJP is ""fishing in the past -- 1984 riots, Ram temple, cow slaughter -- and the Congress is struggling to find a new narrative"".

Mirdha is uncharacteristically candid for a Congressman and scathing in his review of his party's performance in the desert State. ""If we are to show a mirror to the BJP in the general elections, we have to analyse our performance in Rajasthan minutely and do more than farm loan waivers,"" says Mirdha.

The Congress, says this no-nonsense former international commodity trader, will have to work much harder than they are presently doing to trounce the formidable resource and muscle machinery of the BJP.

""The BJP may be irresponsible and misleading people with all this talk of cow slaughter and identity issues but are we better? That is the question that the Congress will have to answer to the people. The downslide of the BJP will tell you that Indian voter is wise and cannot be misled. The Congress has to rise to that challenge,"" says Mirdha.

As the BJP and its ideological affiliates, especially the VHP and the RSS, start plumbing the Ram Mandir politics along with cow slaughter, triple talaq and anti-Pakistan nationalist rhetoric in the hope of whipping up communal polarisation in the general elections, worry is writ large on the faces of the ruling party's key strategists.

""Bhagwan bharose hai (It is all up to God),"" says a senior BJP leader and Union Minister who believes the party's credibility on issues of governance and delivery is at an all-time low.

""Sugarcane arrears are mounting up to over ₹6,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh alone. I still believe we are better placed than the Congress... Let us see what happens. Farm distress is worrisome,"" says the BJP leader.

Observes former Karnataka chief minister and the chairman of Finance Standing Committee of Parliament, Veerappa Moily: ""The theme for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be agriculture and farmers. For rural India, it's not digital economy. It is a cash economy. Farmers sell their crops, take cash and use it for their children's education, marriage, healthcare, etc. Now they feel totally suffocated. They don't get money in their hands when they sell their crops. Payments are delayed. Demonetisation created a new vicious cycle. Even today, money is not available. Even the cooperative banks' money, which is farmers' money, was seized. They destroyed economy. Migrant labourers had to go back to their villages. Unemployment increased. MSMEs are in bad shape. The only beneficiaries were middlemen and black money hoarders.""

The Prime Minister, a feisty campaigner to the last, has already started attacking the Congress on its imminent failure to deliver on the farm-loan waiver promises.

The Congress has its unflattering legacy, which can always be flogged by the Opposition.

The year will once again test the voter's native wisdom on the face of campaign by the BJP on emotive issues and the Congress's tenuous appeal to its traditional constituency of rural poor, tribes, Muslims and jobless youth with more welfarism and opening up of the State purse. The fireworks have only just begun."

In India, eight States got new governments. Egypt held a democratic 'only in name' election, as Abdel Fattah El-Sisi contested against Moussa Moustafa Moussa, a pro-Sisi candidate. In the U.S., Democrats regained control of the House, while the Republicans kept the Senate in midterm elections. Here's a quick look at some of the key elections.

By-elections

The Lok Sabha saw many by-elections this year, beginning with two in Rajasthan and one in West Bengal. The West Bengal seat was held by the Trinamool Congress, while the Congress wrangled two seats in Rajasthan from the BJP. Later in the year, an SP-BSP combine defeated the BJP in two constituencies in Uttar Pradesh -- Gorakhpur and Phulpur -- while the RJD kept its hold on the Araria constituency in Bihar.

With the bypolls in May for four seats, the BJP lost its absolute majority in the Lok Sabha. Two seats were wrested away by the RLD in Uttar Pradesh, and one by the NCP in Maharashtra. In the Karnataka bypolls that took place in November, the BJP retained its seat in Shivamogga.

Rajya Sabha elections

Elections to as many as 59 Rajya Sabha seats were held across various States on March 23. For the first time, the BJP emerged as the single largest party in the Rajya Sabha, thus increasing the number of NDA members in the Upper House to 87. The ruling coalition is still short of majority in the 245-member House of Elders.

It was a nail-biting finish for the Karnataka Assembly elections, which witnessed a three-cornered fight. While the BJP emerged as the single largest party, Congress, which came second, announced its unconditional support to the JD(S) to form a government. Things weren't easy for the Congress-JD(S) combine. The Governor invited the BJP to form the government, even though the coalition claimed to have the support of the majority of legislators.

On the day that a floor test was scheduled, BJP leader B.S. Yeddyurappa, who had been appointed as Chief Minister resigned from his post. The Congress and the Janata Dal (Secular) came together to form a coalition government with H.D. Kumaraswamy as Chief Minister. Mr. Kumaraswamy breezed through a vote of confidence as BJP members walked out of the Assembly.

After 25 years, the CPI(M) lost its hold on the northeastern State, with the BJP winning a thumping majority. Biplab Kumar Deb became the Chief Minister of Tripura. The BJP won 35 of the 59 seats to which elections were held on February 18. Its ally, the Indigenous People's Front of Tripura, won eight seats, taking the tally to 43. The CPI(M), which won 49 seats in 2013, had to be satisfied with 16. Polling in Charilam constituency was postponed due to the demise of the CPI(M) candidate. However, that seat also went to the BJP after the March 12 election.

Elections were held in 59 out of 60 constituencies in Nagaland, and Neiphiu Rio of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) was elected unopposed from Northern Angami II. Mr. Rio went on to become the Chief Minister of the State after NDPP forged an alliance with the BJP. The BJP was part of the Nagaland People's Front (NPF)-led government in Nagaland till the Assembly elections but parted ways to join hands with the newly-formed NDPP.

At the beginning of the year, the elections in Meghalaya was a direct contest between the national players -- the Congress and BJP. As days passed, it became a multi-cornered fight with the United Democratic Party (UDP) and National People's Party (NPP) turning rivals. As the results were finally announced on March 3, the electorate of Meghalaya gave a fractured verdict with the Congress emerging as the single largest party by winning 21 seats. Conrad Sangma's National People's Party (NPP) finished second with 19 seats.

The next day, a rainbow coalition of non-Congress parties including the NPP, the BJP, United Democratic Party, and Hill State People's Democratic Party joined hands to form the government with Mr. Sangma as the Chief Minister.

The Congress lost its lone government in the northeastern region, by losing the elections to the Mizo National Front (MNF). The MNF president Zoramthanga was sworn in as the ninth Chief Minister, beginning his third stint at the helm of the State. The BJP, for the first time, bagged a seat in Mizoram.

Ending 15 years of BJP's rule, the Congress won an absolute majority in Chhattisgarh by bagging 58 seats. The newly-formed Janata Congress Chattisgarh headed by former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi opened its account with five seats. The election was a shocker to the BSP too, since it secured only two seats. Bhupesh Baghel was sworn in as the Chief Minister, with other chief ministerial candidates T.S. Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu getting important portfolios.

Elections were held for 199 seats of the Rajasthan Assembly, of which the Congress emerged victorious in 99 constituencies. With the support from Independents -- who were former Congress leaders who contested elections on their own after being denied the party ticket -- Congress leaders Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were sworn in as Rajasthan's Chief Minister and Deputy Chief Minister respectively.

The BJP lost another State in the Hindi heartland, with Congress forming the government in Madhya Pradesh. After a marathon counting session that lasted almost 24 hours, the Congress won 114 seats and the BJP came a close second with 109. The BSP and the SP, extended their support to the Congress in an attempt to keep the BJP from forming a government. However, the Congress extended the olive branch to the Independents and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath became the Chief Minister. Mr. Nath didn't contest the election. He will have to be elected to the Assembly within six months.

Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao dissolved the State Legislative Assembly six months in advance and called for an early election. Riding on high with a slew of welfare schemes and mega irrigation projects, and the charismatic leadership of Mr. Rao, the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) retained power with a landslide victory.

The Congress-led rainbow alliance, called Praja Kutami (People's Front) that includes the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Telangana Jana Samithi (TJS) and the Communist Party of India (CPI), came a cropper. While the TRS won in 88 of the 119 constituencies, the Congress secured 19 seats and the TDP emerged victorious in just two constituencies. The TJS and the CPI drew a blank.

U.S. Midterms

In the midterm elections to the U.S. House of Representatives, the Democrats secured a majority by defeating the Republicans with a 6.5% point margin and achieved a 4.4% swing from the 2016 Presidential poll.

They gained substantially in the key swing States and made a dent in Republican strongholds. Democrats seized the House majority from President Donald Trump's Republican Party in a suburban revolt that threatened what's left on the President's governing agenda. But the GOP gained ground in the Senate and preserved key governorships, beating back a ""blue wave"" that never fully materialised.

Cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan won the national elections in neighbouring Pakistan, the third consecutive election of a civilian government. Mr. Khan's Tehreek-e-Insaf party won 116 of 269 seats in the National Assembly. However, the election had its own share of controversies. There were allegations of rigging and military interference. The Lahore strongman and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was barred from constesting polls after he was convicted in a corruption case. A bomb blast in Quetta on July 25, the election day, killed over 30 people.

The PTI was several seats short of majority. A post-poll alliance was forged with several smaller parties including Muttahida Qaumi Movement, Pakistan Muslim League (Q), Balochistan Awami Party, the Grand Democratic Alliance and several independents. Mr. Khan became the Prime Minister on August 18.

Egypt

Egypt's election was democratic only in name. President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, a former General who had ousted the Muslim Brotherhood from power in 2013, was never expected to struggle to secure a second term. The vote was effectively rendered a one-horse race involving Mr. Sisi, as a number of opposition candidates were forced to withdraw from the contest. His lone challenger, a late entrant thrust forward to save the government from embarrassment, was someone who had declared himself a staunch supporter of the President's bid for re-election.

Zimbabwe

In a post-Mugabe country, Mnangagwa received 50.8 % of the vote while main opposition challenger Nelson Chamisa received 44.3 %. While election day was peaceful in a break from the past, deadly violence against people protesting alleged vote-rigging reminded many Zimbabweans of the decades of military-backed repression under Mugabe.

In electing retired army Captain Jair Bolsonaro as its President, Brazil chose to be governed by a man described as the ""Trump of the Tropics"", after the 45th U.S. President, Donald Trump. Mr. Bolsonaro swept a runoff election over the weekend, winning nearly 55% of the vote to defeat the left-of-centre Fernando Haddad.

Mexico

Angry and frustrated over corruption and violence, Mexican voters delivered a tidal wave presidential election victory to leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, giving him a broad mandate to upend the political establishment and govern for the poor. Ending 89 years of government by the same two parties, Mr. López Obrador surged to victory in the July 1 elections promising a new approach to issues fuelling widespread outrage: crime, poverty and corruption.

Malaysia

Nonagenarian Mahathir Mohamad once again became the President of Malaysia ending the six-decade rule of the Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition.

Dr. Mahathir, who headed the Opposition alliance Pakatan Harapan, came out of retirement to take on Prime Minister Najib Razak, who has become embroiled in massive corruption scandal surrounding state fund 1MDB. In the May 10 elections, Dr. Mahathir's coalition secured 115 seats surpassing the threshold of 112 seats needed in parliament to form a government.

The much-anticipated presidential polls of Maldives were held on September 23 and the joint Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih emerged as the surprise winner. Elections were announced to the island archipelago after former President Mohamed Nasheed was debarred from contesting elections on ""terror charges"" and another former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was imprisoned. The then President Abdulla Yameen hardly had a rival till the little known Mr. Solih was announced as the joint opposition candidate.

Italy

In Italy, elections ended in a hung Parliament, but the election was a strong rejection of the incumbent, centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which has managed just 19% of the vote. After three months, the M5S, called the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini's League came to an agreement on coalition, and Guiseppe Conte became the Prime Minister.

Turkey

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan claimed victory in the June 24 presidential election and said his ruling AK Party and its alliance partner had won a parliamentary majority. The June 24 vote ushered in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Mr. Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum.

One of the last general election of the year, Bangladesh national elections saw the ruling Awami League heading towards a landslide victory. This will be the third consecutive term for Sheikh Hasina, who has been in power since 2008. Unlike the 2013, where the Awami League won unopposed as key Opposition parties boycotted the elections, Ms. Hasina faced the Jatiyo Oikya Front, a grand coalition of several opposition parties headed by Kamal Hossain.

Congo

The Democratic Republic of Congo voted using electronic voting machines for the first time. This is the third full-fledged election to the mineral rich African nation, which hit the news recently for the massive Ebola outbreak. Congo became multi-party democracy in 2006 with Joseph Kabila elected as its President. The 2011 elections were marred by large scale violence and allegations of rigging, with Mr. Kabila declared as the winner again. As the Congo laws don't allow a third consecutive term for a President, Mr. Kabila has fieled his loyalist Emmanuel Ramazani Shadary. Martin Fayulu, a businessman, and Felix Tshisekedi, son of late opposition icon Etienne, are the other contenders."

Rajan Singh is a member of Bihar's legislative assembly.

According to the poster left after the attack on Singh's house, the BJP lawmaker was supposed to exchange demonetized notes worth Rs 5 crore but he did not uphold his promise. The poster claimed that Singh had taken the money and an extra Rs 2 crores went to his cousin. However, the money was not given back.

The posters read, ""Rajan Singh ko notebandi ke samay Maowadi dwara badalne hetu diya gaya Rs 5 crore tatha levy ka bakaya Rs 2 crore party ko wapas karo.""

A 200-strong group had attacked Singh's residence in Aurangabad on Saturday night. They set his house and 10 cars on fire. They also shot his 55-year-old uncle, Narendra Singh, dead.

However, Singh denied that the Maoist attack had to do with any cash exchange. He instead put the blame on the police for lack of security.

""The Maoist attack in the village is the result of mistakes of both the administration and the state government,"" he was quoted as saying by NDTV.

He added, ""I had given an application to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the DGP for setting up a police station or at least a police outpost in the village, but no action has been taken. The administration and the state government are responsible for the incident.""

Hundreds of pamphlets found in Sudi Bigaha village of the district after the late-night attack last Saturday on the houses of MLC Rajan Kumar Singh and his cousin Sunil Singh. His uncle was shot dead and ten vehicles were set on fire by the Maoists.

Around 30-40 motorcycle-borne Maoists attacked Sudi Bigaha, just one km from Deo police station, around 9.10pm. The police investigation suggested the attack was aimed to terrorise the Bharatiya Janata Party leader and his cousin, who owns and runs buses.

Another reason for the attack, said the pamphlets, was Sunil Singh's failure to honour a Rs 2-crore extortion demand.

""Attach the movable and immovable property of BJP MLC and contractor Rajan Kumar Singh. Rajan Singh should return Rs 5-crore given at the time of demonetisation for exchange and Rs 2-crore due as levy,"" they said.

The pamphlets claimed that Maoists will continue to attack properties of contractors and landlords for wrongfully getting assets of their leaders attached.

""Our fight is not against Sang Parivar activists, the BJP or their family members. Our fight is against elements like Rajan Singh,"" they said.

Rajan Kumar Singh said he has met chief minister Nitish Kumar and demanded setting up of police pickets in Sudi Bigaha in view of the Maoist threat. He alleged that police reached the spot after two hours of the attack.

""I constantly feared for myself and my family and even wrote to the DGP (director general of police), but no action was taken,"" he alleged.

Aurangabad's superintendent of police Satya Prakash said police found similar pamphlets in September as well after a gun battle with the Maoists.

""The pamphlet mentioned about a threat to the life of the MLC and subsequently his security was increased. The Aurangabad administration also advised him to park his vehicles on the premises of Deo police station, but it was later ignored,"" he added.

On Thursday, suspected Maoists abducted two farmers from Patepur police station area of Vaishali district.

Paramilitary forces, district police, and the special task force have been combing the area. A dog squad was also pressed into the service. The farmers, however, are yet to be traced."

Damle adds ""The single seniors are divided into three age-groups, 55 to 64 are Bal Jyeshtha (child-like old), 65 to 80 are Tarun Jyeshtha (young old), and 80 plus Khare Jyeshtha (really old). ""This way, we ensure we are not pairing up two really diverse ages because then it increases complexities.""

Obstacles and hinderance

Damle recalls that the first couple to have met through the trip was in their first year itself. ""It was a trip to Menavali, after that it kept increasing every year. I would put up a listings in daily newspapers and people would come for the monthly meetings. Last year, I took a break because of some personal issues. But this year on, we are looking at helping and assisting as many senior singles as possible.""

So, what are the obstacles that he faces on a regular basis when it comes to such relationships.Damle says, ""To be very honest, most of them are often worried about what society will say, or what will relatives say or what will their children say. Mostly, the kids are worried about having an extra member in the property share. Property is one of the most common bone of contention between single seniors and their kids"".

Senior couples who did not let society dictate their lives

Transparency and honesty are the key for a live in: Anil Yardi and Asawari Kulkarni (67)

In February 2019, Asawari Kulkarni and Anil Yardi will complete four years of living together. The couple admits that they would not want it in any other way. Kulkarni shares, ""It has been a great experience and a fun-filled four years. I am not saying it is an easy process but that also depends on how transparent you have been with your partner. For me, I had a lot of me time when we moved in together, as he runs his own office as a consultant. He would leave home at 9.30 am and come back by 7pm. So, we gave each other the required space initially and that was important too.""

Though they have had a great experience over the years,Kulkarni suggests that other senior couples should first spend enough time with respective partners before taking any step. ""We were lucky that our wavelengths and thoughts matched and have continued to match. However the same cannot be said about every relationship. So, I would suggest even before living together couples should understand the basic nature and behaviour of the partner. This way, it will make things smoother once they move in. Transparency and honesty are the key for a live-in. You have to be honest and crystal clear about your past, finances and other relevant issues.""

She adds that despite being in a relationship, partners need to learn to be strong and independent. ""You must not enforce or interfere too much or at all. Also, don't let society or people around dictate your life. Be your own decision maker and don't get bogged down on what people will say.""

Acceptance and patience is a must: Arun Deo, 70 and Meena Deo, 59

When senior citizen Arun met Meena in 2012, they bonded over many topics. The couple went on to spend time together at events and like-minded activities. Meena however was not keen on getting married and wanted to experience a live-in relationship. But, Arun managed to explain to her the pros and cons and they got married on December 28, 2013. Meena says, ""To be very honest, I wasn't keen on marriage. In fact, my advice to all the senior couples out there would be to go in for a live-in experience before marriage. It helps understand the opposite person better as the mask comes off.""

Having said that, Meena shares that a companion in your life does make a difference. ""I lived along for 25 years after I lost my husband. The adjustment has not been easy and I am not going to make it sound like a smooth affair. As you age, your attitude and approach towards life gets rigid. However, it's all about patience and acceptance, both of which I don't have (smiles),"" adds Meena

Arun, on the other hand, was keen on marriage for reasons he calmly explained to Meena. ""Being a banking professional, I understood the technicalities and legalities involved in relationships, did not have the stamp of a marriage. Hence, I insisted on a legal marriage and we have completed five years on December 28. I wont say it is a glorious one but it has been a roller coaster ride"", said Arun.

He adds that the definition of having a companion changes at different ages and he is glad he found one. ""Your priorities change over the years and adjustment becomes a major part of your being. And, that is what I have been following. We do have our differences but we enjoy ourselves too. We have been on trips to Europe, Kenya and Australia together."""

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 8241 OF 2009

JHARKHAND STATE HOUSING BOARD V DIDAR SINGH & ANR.

Dated:OCTOBER 09, 2018.

N.V. RAMANA, J.

This appeal by special leave is directed against the

impugned judgment and decree dt. 12.10.2001 passed by the

High Court of Jharkhand at Ranchi in Second Appeal

No.88/2000 whereby the High Court dismissed the appeal filed

by the Board by confirming the concurrent findings of the courts

below.

2. Brief facts in nutshell for proper adjudication of the

dispute involved in the present appeal are, the plaintiff has filed a

suit for permanent injunction alleging that suit schedule property

originally belongs to Raja A.P. Singh Deo of estate of Seraikella.

NONREPORTABLE

Later the property was purchased by Kumar Subodh Singh Deo

vide registered Sale Deed No.3201 dated 4.12.1989. He, in turn,

sold the property to the plaintiff vide registered Sale Deed dated

8.8.1990 for a consideration of Rs.12,000/and

since then he is

in peaceful possession and enjoyment of the property by

constructing a residential building in the land. While that being

so, the defendantBoard

has issued notice dated 4.1.1992 asking

the plaintiff to quit and give vacant possession of the suit land

and threatened the plaintiff to dispossess from the suit land

without any right and title over the same. Hence the plaintiff has

come up with the present suit to protect his possession.

3. The defendant has filed the written statement

contending that the plaintiff vendor has no legal right and title

over the suit schedule property and the sale deed executed by his

vendor will not confer any right or title to the plaintiff. Further

the suit schedule property along with other properties was

acquired by the defendants by way of land acquisition

proceedings in the year 1965 and the possession was handed

over to them. As such, except the defendant, no one else has

right or title over the property. The defendant has taken several

other grounds with regard to maintainability of the suit on the

ground of misjoinder of proper and necessary parties to the suit,

on the ground of limitation, under section 92 of the B.S.H.B. Act

and Rules, as no prior notice was issued before instituting the

suit. Also under Section 62 of the CNT Act, it is the case of the

defendant that the present Suit is not maintainable without

seeking the relief of declaration of title. The suit schedule

property was recorded in the revenue records in the name of the

defendant. Without seeking right, title, possession and correction

of entries in record of right, plaintiff cannot maintain the suit for

injunction and hence sought for dismissal of the suit.

4. The trial court has decreed the suit holding that suit is

not barred under any of the provisions of the B.S.H.B. Act, CNT

Act and the Limitation Act. Though Court took note of Ex.B

-

letter of giving possession to the defendant has come to the

conclusion that the evidence on record does not establish that

the land acquisition proceedings have attained finality. With

regard to maintainability of a suit for injunction, Court gave a

finding that as the plaintiff is able to prove his possession by oral

and documentary evidence, he can maintain a simplicitor suit for

injunction without seeking the relief of declaration.

5. The unsatisfied defendant approached the 1st

Additional District Judge, Singhbhum (West) at Seraikella by way

of Title Appeal No.46/1995. The 1st Appellate Court dismissed

the appeal by holding that the mere suit for injunction is

maintainable as the Board threatened to demolish the plaintiff's

house and the proceeding under the Land Acquisition Act are not

successfully proved by the defendant by adducing cogent

evidence. The defendant further carried the matter to the High

Court by way of second appeal and that also ended up in

dismissal. The High Court also observed that as the plaintiff is in

possession of the property, he can protect his possession against

any interference and it is not necessary to prove his title to the

property.

6. The unsuccessful defendant is before us by way of this

appeal.

7. The learned counsel for the appellantBoard

has

argued that the disputed property was part of the Government

land acquired through land acquisition proceedings and the

possession of the same lies with the appellantBoard.

The claim

of the respondentsplaintiffs

over the suit land was hence illegal

and they were enjoying the same unlawfully and without a valid

title. The appellantBoard

therefore sought to evict the

respondentsplaintiffs

from the suit land. Further, they claimed

that the suit is barred under Section 92 and Section 62 of the

Bihar State Housing Board Act and Rules. The plaintiff's suit for

mere injunction is not maintainable without seeking the relief of

declaration of title and hence the Courts below erred in decreeing

the suit.

8. On the other hand, the counsel for the respondents

has submitted that the suit land was a private property and

respondent No.1 herein got the ownership rights by virtue of a

registered sale deed No. 2343 executed on 7th August, 1990 and

since then the property has been in his possession. He could

prove his possession and prima facie title to the property. It is

further stated that without claiming the relief of declaration of

title, he can maintain the suit for mere injunction and Courts

below have rightly and concurrently found that he is in

possession of the property.

9. We have heard the learned counsel for the appellant

and the respondent and perused the material available on record.

In view of the concurrent finding of facts by the courts below we

are conscious of the limited scope of adjudication in this appeal.

10. The issue that fall for our consideration is: ""Whether

the suit for permanent injunction is maintainable when the

defendant disputes the title of the plaintiff?""

11. It is well settled by catena of Judgments of this

Court that in each and every case where the defendant

disputes the title of the plaintiff it is not necessary that in all

those cases plaintiff has to seek the relief of declaration. A

suit for mere injunction does not lie only when the defendant

raises a genuine dispute with regard to title and when he

raises a cloud over the title of the plaintiff, then necessarily in

those circumstances, plaintiff cannot maintain a suit for bare

injunction.

12. In the facts of the case the defendantBoard

by relying

upon the land acquisition proceedings and the possession

certificate could successfully raise cloud over the title of the

plaintiff and in those circumstances plaintiff ought to have

sought for the relief of declaration. The Courts below erred in

entertaining the suit for injunction.

13. Hence in view of the above discussion, we are of the

considered opinion that the judgment and decree impugned in

the appeal deserves to be set aside and accordingly we set aside

the same. However, a request was made at the time of hearing

on behalf of the plaintiff to direct the parties to maintain status

quo for a period of three months to enable the plaintiff to avail

the appropriate remedies available under law. In view of the long

pending litigation, we deem it appropriate to direct the parties to

maintain status quo with regard to possession for a period of

three months. Resultantly, the appeal is allowed with the above

observations by setting aside the judgment and decree dt.

12.10.2001 but in the circumstances without costs.

IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA

CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION

CIVIL APPEAL NO. 8242 OF 2009

JHARKHAND STATE HOUSING BOARD ... APPELLANT

VERSUS

ANIRUDH KUMAR SAHU & ORS. ...RESPONDENTS

JUDGMENT

N.V. RAMANA, J.

In this appeal the unsuccessful defendant impugned

the judgment and decree passed by the High Court of Jharkhand

at Ranchi in second appeal in 273/2003 dt. 26/8/2004 whereby

the High Court has confirmed the concurrent findings of the

courts below by decreeing the suit.

2. A close scrutiny of the plaint is necessary for

adjudication of the dispute involved in the present appeal. The

plaintiff has filed title suit no. 5 of 1992 on the file of the Munsif

court at Seraikella. In the plaint after the cause title, he stated

1

NONREPORTABLE

that the suit is for declaration of title, confirmation of possession

and permanent injunction and the suit is valued at Rs. 20,000/.

Then the plaint starts with the description of facts that the suit

schedule property belongs to Raja Adithya Pratap Singh Deo of

the estate of Seraikella and subsequently it is purchased by

Kumar Subodh Singh by registered sale deed dated 24081990,

he in turn sold the suit schedule property to the plaintiff by way

of registered sale deed dt 21101990

for a consideration of Rs.

20,000/and

ever since than he has been in possession of the

property by constructing a residential building. The defendant

has sent notice dated 04011992

asking the plaintiff to quit and

deliver vacant possession of the suit land and for payment of

amount and further threatened the plaintiff to dispossess him

from the land. Hence he came up with the present suit seeking

the relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants

from interfering with the peaceful possession and enjoyment of

the plaintiff.

3. The defendant has filed the written statement alleging

that the suit is barred under the principles of waiver, estopple,

acquisition, under Section 38 of Specific Relief Act and on the

2

ground of not impleading the proper and necessary parties to the

suit, and also on the ground of not issuing the notice under

Section 62 and 92 of the BSHB Act. Further it was stated that

the mere suit for perpetual injunction without claiming any relief

of declaration as to the entry in the record of right, declaration of

title and for confirmation of possession, is not at all maintainable

either in law or in facts. In fact, the plaintiff in the suit is

indirectly seeking the declaratory relief which is not permissible.

4. It is further averred in the written statement that the

plaintiff's vendor has no right and title to the property as the

property is in possession of the defendant since 1965 and prior to

that it was in possession of the State of Bihar. The property was

acquired through land acquisition proceedings and possession

was delivered way back in 1965 and hence sought dismissal of

the suit.

5. We have gone through the judgment of the trial Court,

1st Appellate court and the High Court. The Courts below have

entertained the suit as if the suit is filed for declaration of title

which is evident from the judgments wherein they have

categorically observed that the Suit is for declaration of title,

3

confirmation of possession and also for perpetual injunction. The

trial Court has framed the issue with regard to the title and gave

a finding that plaintiff has proved his title and possession over

the suit land and constructed a house over the same, as there is

interference, he has come up with the present suit, as such he is

entitled to maintain the suit in the present form. The trial Court

has framed several issues and held all the issues in favour of the

plaintiff but only granted the relief of permanent injunction to the

plaintiff. The unsuccessful defendant approached the appellate

Court and the appeal was dismissed. In the second appeal, the

High Court also went ahead with the same assumption that it is

a declaratory suit and dismissed the appeal by observing that

both the Courts concurrently found that plaintiff has valid right,

title and interest.

6. We have heard the learned counsel on either side and

perused the material available on record. We are very much

surprised at the way the suit was dealt with by the Courts below

contrary to the pleadings and contrary to the settled legal

position. In the plaint, plaintiff has clearly averred that as the

defendants are interfering with his possession, the necessity

4

arose to file the suit for permanent injunction and particularly

sought the prayer for permanent injunction. The trial Court has

framed several issues and held all the issues in favour of the

plaintiff including the issue with regard to title but granted only

the relief of injunction. The trial Court has given several findings

with regard to the title and observed that plaintiff has got right

and title to the property. Even the 1st appellate Court has also

made specific observation with regard to title and gave a clear

finding that plaintiff has asked for declaration. High Court

mechanically confirmed the judgment and decree of the Courts

below without appreciating both the legal and factual aspects.

7. We have given our anxious consideration and we are of the

considered opinion that the Courts below misconstrued the

pleadings and went on a premise that the suit is for declaration

of title when the same is for bare injunction and in a way

declared the title of the plaintiff. Even before this Court plaintiff

filed the counter and stated that his suit is only for the relief of

injunction. The learned counsel has also submitted that the relief

sought is only for injunction. The copy of the plaint filed before

us also strengthens the same. The judgment and decree under

5

appeal deserves to be set aside and accordingly appeal is allowed.

It was brought to our notice that plaintiff is continuing with the

possession of the property during the pendency of the litigation.

In view of the same we deem it appropriate to direct the parties to

maintain status quo for a period of 3 months and if so advised, to

avail the remedy available under law. Resultantly, the appeal is

allowed with the above observations by setting aside the

judgment and decree dated 26th August, 2004, in the

circumstances without costs.

The year started well for the Congress, when it won the three bypolls held in January, wresting Alwar and Bhilwara Lok Sabha seats and the Mandalgarh assembly seat from the BJP.

The Congress built on this over the months even as the Bharatiya Janata Party stepped up its own act.

As chief minister, Vasundhara Raje led a 'Gaurav Yatra' that crisscrossed the state. When the assembly polls drew nearer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah launched a series of public meetings.

These were matched by rallies by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in some high-pitched electioneering, which ended with his party winning 99 of the 199 seats where polling took place.

A tussle followed within the Congress between veteran Ashok Gehlot and party's state unit chief Sachin Pilot - first for the chief minister's post and then over the allocation of portfolios. Gehlot is now CM and retains nine main portfolios, including home and finance.

Earlier in the election-year, Raje faced her share of dissent.

Senior BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari accused her of corruption and misgovernance and wrote several letters to the party's top leadership. He went on to launch his own 'Bharat Vahini Party', but faced a drubbing in the December 7 elections.

Veteran BJP leader Jaswant Singh's MLA-son Manvendra Singh, who had old scores to settle with Raje, also quit the party and switched over to the Congress just ahead of the elections.

But tribal leader Kirori Meena returned to BJP-fold after about a decade and was made a Rajya Sabha MP.

Raje's BJP government courted controversy over a Bill that barred the prosecution of public servants without official sanction. It would have also put curbs on the media on identifying the accused in such cases. Facing protests, her government withdrew the Bill.

In July, cow vigilantism claimed a life in Alwar district. Rakbar Khan (28) was lynched by a group of people who suspected him and a companion of smuggling cows.

The police faced flak for allegedly not rushing the badly injured man to hospital, and focusing instead on taking the cows found with him to a cattle shelter. An assistant sub-inspector was suspended and two constables were shunted to police lines for this.

Three men were arrested for attacking Rakbar Khan even as BJP MLA Gyan Deo Ahuja appeared to defend the cow vigilantes, arguing that the death should be blamed on the police and not on them.

Courts in Jodhpur dealt with a couple of high-profile cases.

Bollywood star Salman Khan was sentenced to five years in jail in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case. The 'Dabangg"" actor spent two days in Jodhpur jail as prisoner number 106 before being released on bail.

Actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam were acquitted in the case that goes back to the days when they were shooting together in Jodhpur for 'Hum sath sath hain'.

A special SC/ST court in Jodhpur awarded life imprisonment to self-styled godman Asaram Bapu and 20-year sentences to two co-accused for the rape of a teenager at his ashram in 2013.

An outbreak of Zika virus in Jaipur rang alarm bells in Delhi. The city reported 144 cases. Teams from the Centre and the National Institute of Virology in Pune camped in the state capital to help contain the virus. There were no deaths.

Prime Minister Modi also travelled to Rajasthan to launch the ""commencement of work"" on the Barmer oil refinery and petrochemical complex. The Congress cried foul as the foundation stone for the project in 2013 by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi. But the BJP government said it had renegotiated the stalled project.

2018 was a year when India lost many prominent personalities from all walks of life, with politics and cinema receiving a particularly severe blow. Mass outpouring of grief followed former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's death on August 16, which marked the end of an era in India's politics. His death prompted mournings from across the political spectrum that was at odds with a recent political climate that has been defined by intense partisanship, coarse insults and divisive rhetoric. The death of Tamil Nadu's Kalaignar - Muthuvel Karunanidhi, on August 7, too left a void in the southern state's political history.

As 2018 draws to a close, let us take a look at the political leaders India had to bid farewell to this year:

Bhishma Narain Singh - August 1

Former Union minister Bhishma Narain Singh died following prolonged illness. He was 85. His contribution to Congress and Gandhian ways were always speculated and admired.

RK Dhawan - August 6

Rajinder Kumar Dhawan, breathed his last at the B L Kapur hospital, New Delhi. He ailed from sepsis and passed away following a prolonged illness. A close confidante of Indira Gandhi, he was known to be part of her inner circle during the Emergency years. He was 81 at the time of his death.

Muthuvel Karunanidhi - August 7, 2018

Renowned politician and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M Karunanidhi breathed his last on August 7, 2018, owing to multiple organ failure. Fondly known as Kalaignar, the writer and politician from Tamil Nadu, died at 94, leaving a void in Tamil Nadu's political history. He had served as CM of the southern state for almost two decades over five terms between 1969 and 2011. He was a long-standing leader of the Dravidian movement and 10-time president of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam political party.

Somnath Chatterjee - August 13

Somnath Chatterjee, a 10-time Member of Parliament and former Speaker of the Lok Sabha, died at the age of 89. The veteran Marxist leader practised law for 18 years before he took a formal plunge into politics. In 1971, he contested the general elections for the first time, just three years after becoming a member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in West Bengal. Over the next few decades, Chatterjee left a mark on Parliament and on Indian politics as a formidable orator. Somnath Chatterjee went on to become a Member of Parliament for 10 times. The only time he lost a parliamentary election was in 1984 when Mamata Banerjee defeated him from Kolkata's prestigious Jadavpur constituency.

Balramji Das Tandon - August 14

Chhattisgarh Governor Balram Das Tandon passed away after suffering a heart attack in Dr B R Ambedkar Memorial Hospital in Raipur. He was 90. Tandon was one of the founding members of the Jan Sangh, which later became the BJP. He became the governor of Chhattisgarh in July 2014 and had served on various other posts including the Deputy Chief Minister of Punjab. The 90-year-old leader was also jailed during Emergency from 1975 to 1977.

Atal Bihari Vajpayee - August 16, 2018

Vajpayee, one of India's most charismatic leaders, died at AIIMS hospital in Delhi following a prolonged illness. He was 93. Vajpayee was known as one of India's most revolutionary politicians and was famous for the Pokhran nuclear tests conducted by India in 1998. Vajpayee was prime minister three times: For 13 days in 1996, 13 months from 1998 to 1999 and then from 1999 to 2004. He was an orator par excellence and a parliamentarian of exceptional calibre.

Gurudas Kamat - August 22

Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Gurudas Kamat died of a heart attack in Delhi at the age of 63. A five-time MP, Kamat was a strong organizational man and headed the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) for a long time. He was also the All India Congress Committee general secretary. Born in Ankola village of Uttara Kannada district in Karnataka on 5 October 1954, Kamat was handpicked by the then Prime Minister late Rajiv Gandhi in 1984 as a Congress candidate from Mumbai North East constituency. Kamat, only 30 then, went on to defeat BJP stalwart Pramod Mahajan by more than 96,000 votes.

Narayan D Tiwari - October 18

Tiwari, who served as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh for three terms and Uttarakhand for one term, passed away at the age of 93. He won his first election on a Praja Samajwadi Party ticket from Nainital in 1952. A decade later, he joined the Congress and stuck with it for most of his life. Tiwari's political career began before Independence. As a teenager, he was jailed for 15 months in Nainital prison, according to one account for writing anti-British pamphlets, where his freedom fighter father too was lodged.

Madan Lal Khurana - October 27

Former Delhi chief minister Madan Lal Khurana breathed his last on October 27 following a prolonged illness. He was 82. As a member of the BJP, he had held several posts in the party, including a stint as the national vice president. He first ventured into politics as a student after becoming the general secretary of the Allahabad Students' Union in 1959. His mainstream political stint began with the Jan Sangh, which later became the Bharatiya Janata Party. After his party won legislative assembly elections in 1993, Khurana was instated as CM. The BJP then went on to win the legislative assembly elections in 1993, with Khurana being instated as chief minister. He was appointed as the Union Minister of Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government until it was dissolved in 1999. In 2004, he served as the Governor of Rajasthan from January to November.

Ananth Kumar - November 12

Union minister HN Ananth Kumar died at the age of 59 in Bengaluru. His journey into public life began due to his association with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). Kumar began his parliamentary career when he got elected to Lok Sabha in 1996 from Bangalore South, the constituency, which remained his strong fort till his passing sway, by winning it for six consecutive times.

C N Balakrishnan - December 10

Veteran Congress leader and former Kerala minister C N Balakrishnan died at the age of 84. Balakrishnan was the president of the Thrissur DCC for a long period and later became state treasurer of the party. He was the minister for cooperation in the Oommen Chandy government.

Newly-elected Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel and all the 12 ministers in his cabinet are multimillionaires, while two of the ministers face criminal cases including on charges of forgery and cheating.

According to an analysis by election watchdog Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)released on Thursday, all the cabinet ministers are multimillionaires, with their average assets pegged at Rs 47.13 crore.

The average assets of the ministers in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Chief Minister Raman Singh's cabinet in 2013 stood at Rs 3.04 crore, with 11 of the 12 ministers being multimillionaires while that of the 2008 cabinet was merely Rs 0.81 crore, with only four of the 13 ministers declaring properties in excess of Rs 1 crore.

The richest Minister is T. S. Singh Deo, who possesses assets in excess of Rs 500 crore, followed by Chief Minister Baghel with properties worth over Rs 23 crore.

As regards criminal background, two ministers Korba lawmaker Jaisingh Agrawal and Baghel face criminal cases that include charges of forgery, cheating and rioting.

Much like in 2008 and 2013, the current cabinet has a solitary female minister.

Baghel, who was sworn in on December 17 as the state's 3rd Chief Minister, on Tuesday inducted nine new ministers to expand the cabinet to 12.

In July, cow vigilantism claimed a life in Alwar district. Rakbar Khan (28) was lynched by a group of people who suspected him and a companion of smuggling cows.

Courts in Jodhpur dealt with a couple of high-profile cases.

Bollywood star Salman Khan was sentenced to five years in jail in the 1998 blackbuck poaching case. The Dabangg actor spent two days in Jodhpur jail as prisoner number 106 before being released on bail.

Actors Saif Ali Khan, Tabu, Sonali Bendre and Neelam were acquitted in the case that goes back to the days when they were shooting together in Jodhpur for Hum sath sath hain'.

A special SC/ST court in Jodhpur awarded life imprisonment to self-styled godman Asaram Bapu and 20-year sentences to two co-accused for the rape of a teenager at his ashram in 2013.

For 68-year-old Gajanand Sharma, 2018 could not have been better. He returned home to Jaipur, 36 years after crossing the border by mistake and landing in a Pakistani jail. All this while, his family had no idea about his whereabouts.

After being reduced to just 21 seats in the last assembly elections, the Congress bounced back in Rajasthan in 2018. This was also the year when the Zika virus struck, the law caught up with actor Salman Khan and godman Asaram Bapu, and a man was beaten to death after being branded a cow smuggler. The year started well for the Congress, when it won the three bypolls held in January, wresting Alwar and Bhilwara Lok Sabha seats and the Mandalgarh assembly seat from the BJP. The Congress built on this over the months even as the Bharatiya Janata Party stepped up its own act. As chief minister, Vasundhara Raje led a 'Gaurav Yatra' that crisscrossed the state. When the assembly polls drew nearer, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah launched a series of public meetings. These were matched by rallies by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in some high-pitched electioneering, which ended with his party winning 99 of the 199 seats where polling took place.

A tussle followed within the Congress between veteran Ashok Gehlot and party's state unit chief Sachin Pilot - first for the chief minister's post and then over the allocation of portfolios. Gehlot is now CM and retains nine main portfolios, including home and finance. Earlier in the election-year, Raje faced her share of dissent. Senior BJP leader Ghanshyam Tiwari accused her of corruption and misgovernance and wrote several letters to the party's top leadership. He went on to launch his own 'Bharat Vahini Party', but faced a drubbing in the December 7 elections.

Veteran BJP leader Jaswant Singh's MLA-son Manvendra Singh, who had old scores to settle with Raje, also quit the party and switched over to the Congress just ahead of the elections. But tribal leader Kirori Meena returned to BJP-fold after about a decade and was made a Rajya Sabha MP.

Prime Minister Modi also travelled to Rajasthan to launch the ""commencement of work"" on the Barmer oil refinery and petrochemical complex.

A video of the shocking incident shows six students aged 9-10 years, belonging to Class 3 and 4, standing naked in the hot sun, with their pants down to their ankles and their arms up in the air. The boys stand outside their classroom, even as other students pass by.

The private school, located in the interiors of Chittoor, is run and owned by the school principal Maharaja Naidu, who is on the run after the video came to the attention of child rights activists.

According to child rights activists, the students' parents allege that it was the principal who humiliated the students by asking them to remove their clothes for being late to school.

Some parents also say that the kids were punished for not completing their homework. The parents have been staging a protest in front of the school since Thursday morning, 27 December.

Speaking to TNM, Achyuta Rao, president of Hyderabad-based child rights organisation Balala Hakula Sangham, alleges that not just the principal, but the Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) is also colluding with the school authorities and is trying to hush up the issue.

""Our organisation had a word with the MEO. Instead of immediately cancelling the recognition of the school, the MEO Leela Rani is trying to cover up the issue and has said that she will be taking up the matter with the higher authorities. Is that how an issue of such serious nature has to be dealt with? The principal of the school should be booked under POCSO Act as it's a clear case of exploiting the children's modesty. The children should also be given psychological counselling in the aftermath of such a traumatic experience,"" Rao said.

Balala Hakula Sangham has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and has demanded that action be taken under the POCSO Act. Until now, the police have not registered a case against the school management.

Speaking to the local media, Chittoor DEO B Pratap Reddy, said an investigation into the issue is underway and that the school's recognition for the academic year 2019-2020 could be withdrawn.

"54","1028088645","2018-12-28","http://www.centralchronicle.com/a-nehru-gandhi-family-scion-finally-comes-of-age.html","A Nehru-Gandhi family scion finally comes of age | Central Chronicle","Central Chronicle",FALSE,"New Delhi, It was an year of ascendancy for the Indian National Congress.Under the leadership of its president Rahul Gandhi, the Congress ousted the Bharatiya Janata Party in the three Hindi heartland states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, to emerge as a formidable contender for power in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

With the decisive wins by Congress on the first anniversary of his assumption of office as party president, Rahul Gandhi, arrived as a 'force to reckon with' in the realm of Indian politics, denting the invincible Modi brand.

The Congress youth icon leading the grand old party to victory in the three Hindi states on December 11, his first win since he took over the reins of the party, catapulted Rahul as an unbeatable leader and an impregnable force in Indian politics.

More importantly, the win pitchforked the Congress into the leadership role among the opposition parties who are looking to take on the BJP juggernaut in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Rahul arrives on national scene With these wins, Rahul succeeded in emerging as a tall leader of the Opposition who could pose a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In fact, Dravida Munnetra Kaghazam president M K Stalin openly favoured naming Rahul as the Prime Ministerial candidate of the proposed 'Mahagathbandhan' of the opposition parties .

Though the proposal has not found favour with the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party, some of the recent moves by various Opposition leaders indicate that they could eventually come round to the idea.

This was evident from the fact that BSP chief Mayawati on December 12, a day after the assembly poll results, announced that her party was willing to support the Congress to form a Government in Madhya Pradesh to prevent the BJP from coming to power. Ms Mayawati's move was seen as an indication that the BSP would join the grand alliance of the opposition for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

After the assembly poll results, the Samajwadi Party also announced its decision to support the Congress in government formation in Madhya Pradesh.

The posture taken by the BSP and the SP was in sharp contrast with the stand of these parties before the assembly polls where they had decided to fight the assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh independently.

In a way it was reflective of the new found respect of the opposition leaders for Rahul's leadership .

All of this went to show that an year after assuming office as Congress president, Rahul has succeeded in emerging as a tall leader of the opposition who can pose a formidable challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

It was also evident from the new confident and aggressive tone of Mr Gandhi, which is in sharp contrast to his image as a reluctant politician in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, where the Congress was reduced to 44 seats.

Several assembly elections held since the 2014 polls, including assembly polls in Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, saw the party losing to the BJP.

Gujarat throwback

Political observers say that the ascendancy of the Congress began in the Gujarat assembly polls where the party under Rahul's leadership, put up a formidable performance against the BJP.

Congress, under the leadership of Rahul, giving the saffron party a run for its money in its citadel galvanised an otherwise demoralised Congress cadre and also silenced his detractors within the party.

A rejuvenated Congress under Rahul managed to cobble together a coalition with the Janata Dal (Secular) in the Karnataka after the assembly polls in which the BJP emerged as a single largest party. However, quick action by the Congress saw it form a coalition government with the JD(S) with Mr HD Kumaraswamy being the Chief Minister.

In the past year, Mr Gandhi held news conferences or media interactions at regular intervals on several burning issues, including Justice Loya's death, Rafale aircraft deal, farmers' loan waivers and sending the Central Bureau of Investigation director Alok Verma on leave.

In the past year, he specially attacked the premier on the alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal both inside and outside Parliament.

At public rallies and meetings during the campaign for the assembly elections, Rahul mounted a sharp attack on PM Modi on the issue of waiver of farm loans and the alleged irregularities in the deal for Rafale fighter jets.

In his attack on PM Modi on the Rafale acquisition, Rahul accused the National Democratic Alliance Government of scrapping the United Progressive Alliance deal on the jets, which envisaged the sale of 126 aircraft from the Dassault company, with a deal to buy just 36 planes, disregarding the requirement of the Indian Air Force.

He also charged PM Modi with scrapping the offset contract given to the state-owned Hindustan Aeronauticals Limited to benefit Anil Ambani's Reliance Defence which had no prior experience of manufacturing defence equipment.

The Congress president also alleged that the NDA Government signed the deal for the Rafale aircraft at three times the price of the contract during the UPA rule, causing a heavy loss to the public exchequer.

Concern for Bharat

During his public meetings, Mr Gandhi also charged the PM with ignoring the interests of the farmers and refusing to heed to their demand for loan waivers while foregoing advances worth Rs 3.5 lakh crore of his few corporate friends.

On July 20, participating in a debate on a no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi dispensation in the Lok Sabha, Rahul stunned everyone by giving a spontaneous hug to the premier.The gesture by the Congress president came after his sharp attack on the PM for alleged irregularities in the Rafale deal.

Besides, Mr Gandhi held joint news briefings with leaders of opposition parties across the nation on various issues.The Congress president also held conferences in US, Europe and West Asia as part of the party's Non-Resident Indians outreach ahead of the 2019 national polls to tap into their votes and build up his image as a global leader.

Rahul, who took over the mantle of party president on December 16, 2017, made vigorous efforts to ensure the revival of the party.

It is under his leadership that the party, despite differences within the state units in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, fought these elections unitedly.

Congress infighting

While in Rajasthan, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot were asked to work together, in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath, Jyotiraditya Scindia and Digvijaya Singh were seen fighting the elections unitedly.

The year also saw Rahul take up the issues of agrarian distress and unemployment on a war footing, during which he met tillers across the nation and highlighted issues of farmers distress and unemployment among youth in his various public meetings.

The win in the three Hindi heartland states showed that Rahul's view on farmers' distress and unemployment had struck a chord among farmers and youth pan-India.

Also, the decision of the newly-installed Congress governments to announce waiver of farm loans within hours of assuming power pitched Rahul as a leader for whom interests of agriculturists assume topmost priority.

The latest electoral victories, party leaders feel, had elevated Rahul's stature within the party as well as among the opposition parties.

Post its win in the three Hindi heartland states, the Congress and its president Rahul Gandhi are now setting the agenda for the Lok Sabha elections.

Intact the recent statement by Mr Modi that his government was looking at putting 99 per cent of commodities at a single Goods and Services Tax rate was seen as the government coming round to the Congress demand for a single standard rate of GST.

The latest meeting of the GST council saw a reduction of imposts on several items from 28 to 18 per cent.With Rahul and the Congress setting the agenda for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, scoring victories in the three Hindi heartland states, the grand old party has strengthened its position as the centre of any national formation after the polls.

Race for CM

The party may have wrested power from the BJP in the three Hindi heartland states but it found itself facing a standoff over the choice of its chief ministers in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

While Rajasthan saw a tussle between senior party leader Ashok Gehlot and state PCC chief Sachin Pilot over the post of chief minister, Madhya Pradesh saw a race between nine-time Lok Sabha MP Kamal Nath and young leader Jyotiraditya Scindia for the post.

In Chhattisgarh, there was a tussle for the post between Bhupesh Baghel and TS Singh Deo.

After several rounds of consultations held by the top leadership with the various CM aspirants and the AICC incharges, Mr Ashok Gehlot was announced as Chief Minister of Rajasthan with Sachin Pilot being named as Deputy Chief Minister. In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath was named as the CM while in Chhattisgarh, Bhupesh Baghel was named as the Chief Minister with T s Singh Deo being given a key cabinet portfolio.

With the task of naming the CMs of the three states being accomplished , the three state governemt have now embarked on the task to fulfil the promises made in the manifesto.

The year also witnessed the Congress coming under attack from the BJP over Delhi High Court convicting party leader Sajjan Kumar to life imprisonment for his alleged involvement in the 1984 riots after assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the wake of 'Operation Bluestar.'

The BJP and the Akali Dal demanded the sacking of Sajjan Kumar from the party. They also raked up the issue of the alleged involvement of Mr Kamal Nath in the riots.

With Rahul at the helm of affairs, it was an year which saw his mother and former party president maintain a low key except for a few appearances like her attending the India Today conclave where she revealed that she never wanted Rajiv Gandhi to come into politics.

After the declaration of results of the recent assembly elections, Ms Sonia Gandhi expressed happiness over the outcome, particularly in the Hindi heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

Reacting to the results, Ms Gandhi called it a 'Congress victory over negative politics of BJP' and said she was 'happy' with the verdict of the people.

She was also believed to be a part of the deliberations within the party to resolve the standoff for the selection of chief ministers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.The year also saw the deaths of Congress veterans ND Tiwari and Gurudas Kamat.

Senior Congress leader and former Union minister Gurudas Kamat died in August at Primus Hospital, Chankyapuri, in New Delhi on August 22 at the age of 63 years.

Kamat had served as the Minister of State for Home Affairs under the Manmohan Singh-led UPA-2 government. He represented Mumbai in the Lok Sabha multiple times.

Congress veteran Narayan Dutt Tiwari, who served in various positions at the Centre and in states, died on his birthday on October 18 at a private hospital in New Delhi in October after prolonged illness, aged 92 years."

In the last week of November, after the government of India's decision, the Gujarat government had also announced that it will act against schools not following the schoolbag weight criteria and that are forcing children to carry bulky bags.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We have issued a directive to all education officers to check and prepare a list of schools flouting schoolbag norms. We will first issue notices and if the schools fail to reduce the bag weights we will penalize them. The government is working outthe penalty for such schools.""

Chudasama said no homework is to be assigned to students of classes I and II. Only half an hour of homework can be given classes III to V students and the same for Classes VII and VIII students can be one hour per day.

A district education officer said, ""It will be difficult for us to check the exact weight of the bags as we will not be carrying weighing machines. Inspectors who will be going to the schools will be using their own judgment by looking at the bags and holding it in their hands.""

He said, ""We have asked the schools to schedule their periods in such a way that the student is not required to carry all text books. According to government direction classes for only three to four subjects are to be held in a day. The notebooks for homework and classwork should not be separate. There shall be no separate notebook for essay writing."""

A 16-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a youth she met on social media at his rented apartment in Kanpur Tuesday, police said.

While a case of gangrape was lodged initially, three other youths named in the case were given a clean chit as circumstantial evidence had ruled out gangrape, said Kanpur SSP Anant Deo.

A medical examination confirmed that the minor had been raped, police said. The accused is an engineering student.

According to police, the girl's mother had initially alleged that her daughter was gangraped by the accused and his three friends, but CCTV footage and exchange of WhatsApp messages between the girl and accused ruled out the same. ""However, the girl's friend has been arrested and will be produced in court tomorrow as the girl is a minor,"" said SSP Deo.

He further said, ""CCTV footage shows the girl entering the apartment with her friend (Anurag), and leaving with him hours later. No suspicious circumstances or resistance is seen in the footage.

""The girl's family panicked after her mother found her bleeding, and she filed a police complaint of gangrape against four youths. All four were taken into custody soon after the case was lodged yesterday (Wednesday). The youths claimed to be innocent. One of them showed messages between him and the girl after the incident on his phone,"" the SP said.

Senior Sub-Inspector Mohammad Qamar Khan, the case's investigation officer, said, ""According to the FIR, on Tuesday, the girl left her house at around 10 am to visit a market. At around 1 pm, her friend Anurag Yadav asked her to come to his apartment. As per the initial complaint, Anurag and his three friends raped her. Around 5 pm, they dumped her near her father's house.""

He added, ""The complaint further stated that the girl somehow reached her house and informed her mother about the assault. Her mother said she took the girl, who was bleeding, to a nearby hospital, after which she informed police later in the night...We also recovered a blood-stained bedsheet and a shirt from the flat.

Honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham Achyuta Rao had earlier brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi.

We won't tolerate such inhumanity against the children and hence we have withdrawn recognition of the school and will take severe action against the school management.""

Minister for industries N. Amarnath Reddy has also instructed the district collector to withdraw recognition to the school.

Under the collector's direction, the DEO further released a statement, which reads: ""As a result of the negligent behaviour of the management, the boys left with bare bodies and this is a serious lapse on the part of the management which cannot be excused and thus attracted the provisions of Rules in GO Ms No. 1, dated 01.01.1994 and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 1988. Whereas, the school management behaved with total negligence in maintaining the safety of students and violated the provisions of rules governing the recognition of the private educational institutes and AP Education Act, 1994.

These workers are among those on the ShaktiApp, an internal communication system that directly links registered booth-level workers to the central leadership.

The ShaktiApp is a useful tool to build and energise the base, especially as the Congress party's on-the-ground structures remain weak.

Rahul reportedly congratulated the workers and asked, ""Who should be the chief minister?"" He assured the workers that their replies would remain confidential. Rahul's outreach was not ignored; those approached did respond.

As Rahul has been committed to introducing democratic practices in the party, it could have been expected that Congress spokepersons would take great credit for this consultative process. Far from doing so, the party has made no reference to the exercise. Is this because the recommendations of the workers were ignored? At least, this was so in Chhattisgarh. According to sources who requested anonymity, at least two-thirds of the workers wanted TS Singh Deo to be the chief minister while Gandhi was persuaded by his senior party colleagues to go with an OBC state leader and Bhupesh Baghel took over the coveted office.

Rahul's consultation exercise raises fundamental issues on its compatibility with the tenets of representative democracy, which forms the basis of Indian polity.

File image of Congress president Rahul Gandhi. Reuters

Wide and transparent consultation with party workers in choosing election candidates should become a norm for all parties. If Rahul puts such mechanisms in place in the Congress, he would deserve praise but it seems unlikely that he will do so, for it will go against the patronage system now prevalent -- and this applies to all parties -- in the distribution of election tickets.

After elections, legislative groups of parties have to pick their leaders. Naturally, the leader of the successful party heads the government. Even now, in the states, legislative groups go through the formality of 'electing' their leader who then approaches the governor to stake a claim to form the government. But, as it was demonstrated in the recent elections, the real decisions are taken elsewhere, whereas it is the MLAs who should take the decision, for the government has to be collectively responsible to them. This can apply even to coalition governments.

The Indian political system has morphed to become very different from the basic norm of representative democracy. This process began with the Congress but has spread virtually to all, even cadre-based parties. Parties are now run either by political families or have become the extensions of prominent personalities who command all authority. The fate of all party members lies in their hands and individuals with their own power-bases are not only discouraged but are quashed.

In the initial decades after Independence, there was an element of inner party democracy within the Congress, with many of its chief ministers being authentic mass leaders in their own right. The central leadership seldom thrust its choices on the states where elected MLAs chose their leaders. However, after Indira Gandhi split the Congress, it became her party. Once her sons entered politics, it became a family party. Its leaders became dependent on the family and were chosen by it, and not the elected MLAs. Region and caste-based parties that sprang up in the 1980s and after followed the Congress example.

The BJP is not controlled by members of a family. Its decision-making style has been traditionally more collegial and power and influence more diffused. State units also had greater leeway in decision-making though the popular perception now is that the leadership under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah has centralised all authority. There is also the factor of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and BJP interplay.

A democratic polity has to be sustained by a democratic political culture. As political parties are the most significant actors in the system, the primary responsibility for the evolution of healthy democratic practices primarily rests with them. The discharge of this responsibility requires that democratic and transparent conventions are put in place in choosing candidates and in deciding the basic approaches of a party to national issues. This has been established in many representative democracies and there is no reason why it cannot be done in India.

Once elections are held then power should flow upwards and not, as is the situation, downwards, with the chosen representatives virtually reduced to being used for the exercise of lung power.

As party members, MPs and MLAs have to abide by party discipline but representative democracy also demands that they retain a measure of autonomy. This is necessary in the functioning of the legislatures, both in law-making and in holding the executive accountable. The fact that Parliament and state legislatures are no longer fulfilling these basic functions is obvious. This is adversely impacting India's democratic culture, for no other institutional fix can really fill this shortcoming.

Political parties cannot take the position that their inner working can be exempt from the formal democratic processes. This position is simply not logical but has become an inherent part of India's political culture.

An example has to be set by the national parties. If they pursue inner party democracy, the regional outfits may have to follow suit. From time to time, the Congress has committed itself to doing so and Rahul Gandhi has made attempts in this direction. The party has not succeeded and is unlikely to do so. The fate of Rahul Gandhi's outreach to the workers only underlines that fact.

In yet another case of teacher's tyranny against students, a school in Andhra Pradesh is making headlines after a video revealed five students standing naked under the scorching Sun.

The horrifying incident took place on Wednesday after the class 3 students of Chaitanya Bharati English Medium School at Punganur in Chittoor district came late to the class.

The students were forced to strip naked by teacher Bhuvaneshwari as an act of punishment.

The angry parents have staged a protest along with Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) party workers and demanded the authorities to cancel the registration of the school for such abusive acts.

Child rights activists have also taken the case to the local authorities to take strict action against the school. A complaint has also been filed by Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) against the school management with Punganur police station.

The District Educational Officer (DEO) of Chittoor, Dr K Panduranga Swamy, told International Business Times, India: ""An investigation is underway and as the school management has violated the child rights, the registration of the school will be cancelled from the year 2019-2020.""

""The district collector has also been informed about the seriousness of the issue and stringent actions will be taken against the management and principal of the school, Nagaraju,"" he added.

This is not the first such incident in the state. In 2015, a teacher of a private school in Eluru in West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh had thrashed a girl student of class 1 and made her sit on a stone, naked in the hot sun, as a punishment for not doing homework.

In the same year, another teacher from a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal, Vishakapatanam, asked two students to remove their shirt and stand under the sun for three hours, as a punishment for not doing the homework."

After the gang was busted in December last year, the police said it had cheating more than 20,000 students across India and jeopardised the careers of many unsuspecting candidates who bagged government jobs using fake certificates issued by them.

On Wednesday, Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at least one such candidate -- who had bagged a UP Police job using a fake degree -- had been dismissed from his job after his documents were found to be fake.

The gang ran a fake education board in the name of 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' and operated from west Delhi's Vikaspuri, said the DCP..

Police said the gang was busted for a second time on December 12 after the crime branch received a tip-off about the 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' , said Rajeev Ranjan, additional commissioner of police (crime branch). ""We were already working on a similar recent complaint from the Directorate of Education,"" Ranjan said.

The first person to be arrested was 23-year-old Altaf Raza, who was one of the six persons nabbed last year as well. The police said he was ""one of the masterminds"" of the racket. ""We arrested him on a day he was to appear at a court hearing in the previous case,"" said DCP Deo.

Raza had allegedly learnt the trade from one Shiv Prasad Pandey a few years ago. Pandey was arrested with Raza last year. After coming out on bail, he has gone underground, said the DCP.

The other two men arrested in the latest case are Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar, who run a school in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria and were allegedly involved in scouting for potential candidates as well as schools in desperate need for recognition certificates.

""The gang promised to provide marksheets and degrees of Class 10 and 12 in two-three months without any tests or requirements. The documents provided were fake,"" said DCP Deo.

Each time their website was busted, the gang would allegedly come up with a new portal with a different name.

Named Board of Higher Secondary Education (BHSE), it is estimated to having provided marksheets and certificates of classes X and XII to over 55,000 students for a hefty price.

Three people, including the ""chairman"" Altaf Raja, have been arrested. The two others, Shambhu Nath and Manoj Kumar, are school owners.

Additional commissioner (crime) Rajiv Ranjan said that the gang charged between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000 for the certificates. This syndicate was also involved in providing documents of higher studies from renowned institutes across India. ""A team led by DCP Rajesh Deo and ACP Jasbir Singh tracked down Raja after a complaint from Directorate of Education, Delhi government,"" he added.

A decoy customer was sent to Raja's office with a request for a marksheet and he was caught while delivering it. Raja used to collect the details of students over WhatsApp and receive the amount for providing fake documents through NEFT. The certificate would then be mailed to the student's address. During the raid at the Vikaspuri apartment, several fake marksheets and certificates were seized from him.

During interrogation, Raja told police that he left studies and started working in the office of one Dr Shiv Prasad Pandey in Lucknow. He came to know that Pandey posed as the chairman of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi and ran a branch office in Lucknow. After Pandey's arrest last year, Raja decided to take over the board and started issuing certificates in his own name.

Police have also identified one Ashok Kumar Lakhani as the secretary of the board. He owns a school in the same building from which the board was being run.

Recently, Raja had issued a certificate to a woman who has enrolled with UP Police. UP Police has been informed about it to take legal action against her.

Surprisingly, the racket wasn't unknown to police. Last year, when Pandey was arrested, a probe revealed that the fake board's original owner Mange Ram Acharya was arrested in 2011 from Timarpur. He is currently in a jail in Rajasthan.

The board's operation continued even after the arrest of Pandey who was using the same website and the same name. The website was blocked for a few days, but the crooks somehow managed to reactivate it and continue with their scam."

A Class 11 girl was gangraped and then dumped near Kanpur's Babupurwa police station in an unconscious state, allegedly by four engineering students late on Tuesday evening.

Victim's father, a serving police inspector, has lodged an FIR against one Anurag Yadav and his three friends, Jackie, Shubham and Abhishek. All the four accused are pursuing BTech courses from different colleges.

At the flat, the victim was overpowered and raped. Later, the accused took her in a car and dumped her near Babupurwa police station.

Barring e-commerce marketplaces from selling products of firms in which they own stakes could hit Amazon in particular, given that it has several such joint ventures, including Cloudtail and Appario. Cloudtail is a joint venture between Amazon and N.R. Narayana Murthy's Catamaran Ventures.

The commerce and industry ministry's decision to introduce the new norms follows complaints by small traders, who contend that deep discounts offered by the likes of Amazon and Flipkart are driving them out of business. The issue is of crucial importance for the government, given that national elections are due by May and traders are a core voter base for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party.

The move to ban exclusive deals for products also hurts top online retailers such as Flipkart and Amazon. Flipkart, for instance, has exclusive partnerships with top smartphone brands such as Xiaomi and Oppo. Smartphones contribute over 50% of overall e-commerce sales in India.

E-commerce companies have to go back to the drawing board and see if their business models comply with the new requirements that are effective prospectively from 1 February, said Anil Talreja, partner, Deloitte India.

A senior government official said the changes in the foreign direct investment policy (FDI) on e-commerce were aimed at tackling ""anti-competitive"" behaviour by e-commerce entities.

""There is a wrongful subsidization of products by e-commerce players. In the marketplace model, the e-commerce entity should be neutral to all vendors,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another official said the government would address queries related to the new norms either on Thursday or Friday.

The announcement of the policy evoked massive protests from executives of top e-commerce companies, who warned of a swift pushback. Top executives from both Flipkart and Amazon said they would lobby strongly to either have the new policy scrapped in its entirety or to have significant amendments made to it in order to ensure ""minimum disruption to Indian e-commerce"".

Executives from both companies also claimed they were not consulted before the policy was issued by the government and that there had been no dialogue with commerce and industry minister Suresh Prabhu on this matter.

""This policy makes no sense and is utterly ridiculous. The way this new policy has been crafted shows a complete lack of understanding of the retail landscape in India and how it functions. We were not even consulted before this was issued,"" said a top executive at Amazon, who requested anonymity.

Flipkart did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ""We are evaluating the circular,"" said an Amazon spokesperson.

Most large e-commerce firms previously exploited loopholes in existing FDI rules and created complex structures to get around the norms. For instance, when the government put rules in place that restricted large sellers on platforms such as Flipkart and Amazon from contributing more than 25% of sales, online retailers set up complex structures to get around those loopholes by mandating other sellers to buy from those large sellers and then in turn sell those products on online marketplaces. In other instances, large sellers formed multiple entities, which sold their products separately on online marketplaces.

The latest policy is aimed at plugging those loopholes.

Surprisingly, Kunal Bahl, co-founder of Snapdeal, welcomed the new policy.

""Snapdeal welcomes updates to FDI policy on e-commerce. Marketplaces are meant for genuine, independent sellers, many of whom are MSMEs. These changes will enable a level- playing field for all sellers, helping them leverage the reach of e-commerce,"" Bahl said on Twitter on Wednesday evening.

The new FDI norms, however, may not be in sync with the spirit of competition and free market economy. Only those exclusive arrangements that have an appreciable adverse effect on competition are prohibited under the Competition Act, said Subodh Prasad Deo, partner at law firm Saikrishna and Associates, and former additional director general at Competition Commission of India.

One of the factors that will help in making that assessment is whether such exclusive arrangements create entry barriers to new entrants in the market.

""I'm expecting almost all e-commerce firms with marketplace models to relook their current structures and models. Overall, we will see a lot of introspection by the marketplaces on their current business models to comply with the new policy and a lot more work for the statutory auditors,"" said Sreedhar Prasad, a former partner at KPMG, who recently joined Kalaari Capital as a partner."

Collaborations are the future of the arts. Almost a decade ago, an Australian musician met with a few Indian artistes and today we have what is called The Three Seas, a band that fuses Australian jazz with Bangla folk music. And the result? Nothing but a soothing blend of the two genres. Bengal's Baul tradition with its earthier tones have given this version of jazz a depth that only a few could have thought of.

Says Matt Keegan, the Australian composer, saxophonist and the Artistic Director of The Three Seas, ""I had the idea on that first trip to Santiniketan in 2009. I thought that, in the hands of the right musicians, these sounds could all blend very well together. The unique characteristics stem from the instruments and the techniques involved in playing them."" The Bauls are mystics with a rich cultural heritage and their own language, movements and music style. Raju Das Baul, singer and khamak player, along with multi-instrumentalist Deo Ashis Mothey lead the vocals. Gaurab Chatterjee, the drummer, is a renowned artiste from Kolkata and founding member of Bengal's rock band, Lakkhichhara. He is also fluent in traditional West Bengali folk percussion beats, and specialises in the dubki (hand drum). Australian double-bassist Steve Elphick is a master of jazz and fusion music.

""I am a saxophonist and composer who works in a variety of musical styles but I mainly enjoy creating new music with a diverse array of musical colleagues. The double bass is a wonderfully adaptable instrument that works well with the Indian instruments and my baritone sax has a deep voice that can blend nicely but can also really contrast the other instruments very well too,"" says Keegan. Some of the Three Seas pieces are modern interpretations of the traditional Baul songs that celebrate this spirit. ""For me, it is mainly the feeling I get from a particular place, person or situation that inspires my work as a composer. While reflecting on thoughts of these kind, I often hear music that is inspired by my feelings. The trick is to capture the music when you hear and feel it, before it disappears into the ether,"" reflects Keegan.

Their second album, ""Fathers, Sons & Brothers"" was recorded in Sydney while on their first tour of Australia in 2017.

""The music reflects the diverse nature of the band. The title track was composed by our drummer Gaurab Chatterjee, I contribute three originals compositions that put the focus on the baritone saxophone, we play two traditional Baul songs that feature Raju Das, and Ashish Mothey has brought an arrangement of a Carnatic song, a Nepali song and a rap in Hindi,"" says Keegan.

At their recent Delhi concert, the Three Seas picked a selection of tracks from their two previous albums with some brand new material composed for their India tour as part of the ongoing Australia Fest.

As an artiste, Keegan says that it is imperative to seek and understand various cultures to encourage and uplift one's own art. ""As a non-Indigenous Australian, we have very young culture and therefore limited inspiration to draw from, so for me looking to other places for inspiration has been crucial to my understanding of how music works,"" he says.

But there are advantages of being a contemporary Australian musician as well. ""There is less cultural baggage to negotiate and a freedom to look at music in possible naive ways, but with a fresh perspective. Making original music is what I love to do most. The Three Seas is born from my interest in combining new sounds with great people. These collaborations can only work if all the members come together with a sharing attitude and open heart,"" sums up Keegan."

The minister made the remark Friday after a BJP MLC from the state, Bukkal Nawab, dubbed Lord Hanuman a Muslim on the ground that his name rhymed with Islamic names like Rahman, Arman, Qurban etc.

During an election rally in Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had termed the deity a Dalit.

If the remark made by Nawab has the BJP high command's approval, ""then the party will have to get a mosque constructed for Lord Hanuman"", the seer said.

The chief minister had hurt religious sentiments by terming Lord Hanuman a Dalit, even as his office later issued a clarification, claiming that Adityanath was misquoted, the Shankaracharya said.

Lord Hanuman has been termed a Jat, Thakur, a sportsman and even a Muslim, even though gods and goddesses are above caste and religion, he stated.

Uttar Pradesh Sports Minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan had said on Sunday that Hanuman was a sportsperson.

However, he had dismissed his party colleagues' attempts at identifying the deity's caste and said gods don't have castes.

The seer asked the BJP to clear its stand on the remarks and claimed no clarification was issued by the party on the statements on Lord Hanuman.

""The silence by BJP higher ups and RSS functionaries (on the remarks on Lord Hanuman) indicates that for the BJP, the Ram temple is a tool to garner votes,"" he said, adding that the temple in Ayodhya will be constructed by seers and dharmacharyas.

""Because of the poor result last year, teachers have already prepared their students accordingly,"" Rana added.

Meanwhile, St John's High School principal Kavita Das said, ""In most of the schools, they finish their syllabus by December. Now, mostly practising and testing begins. My students will not be uncomfortable with early exams.""

Das said, ""When we had taken up this matter with CBSE, they told us that they are advancing smaller exams so that results are not delayed.""

BJP spokesperson Sachchidanand Upasane said it was expected that senior leaders with administrative skills will be given berths in the cabinet, but it seemed that the chief minister wanted to keep all the rights with him.

""This cabinet will function with the remote control in Baghel's hands,"" he said. Upasane claimed the cabinet formation ""clearly reflects differences among leaders within the ruling party"" as all the sections were not properly covered in it.

Newly-elected Chief Ministers of Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Chhattisgarh hustled to combine their auspicious times and availability of Anandiben Patel, who is the Governor in both the states, for the expansion of their councils of ministers.

Patel had to shuttle between the two states' capitals -- Bhopal and Raipur -- to administer the oath of office and secrecy to the council of ministers in the respective states on Christmas Day. Both CMs assumed office on December 17 and were awaiting another auspicious day to expand their Cabinet.

After much deliberation between astrologers and leaders, Congress decided in Madhya Pradesh that the council of ministers will take oath on Christmas Day in the morning and post-lunch on the same day in Chhattisgarh. Patel, as a result, had a packed schedule on Christmas.

In MP, CM Kamal Nath expanded his council of ministers by inducting 28 legislators, including two women legislators and an Independent, and in Chhattisgarh, CM Bhupesh Baghel inducted nine MLAs, including a woman legislator, as ministers.

Those who were sworn-in in MP, included Govind Singh (MLA from Lahar), Arif Aqueel (Bhopal North), Bala Bachchan (Rajpur ST), Sajjan Singh Verma (Sonkutch), Vijay Laxmi Sadho (Maheshawr) and Hukum Singh Karada (Shajapur). Aqueel is the only Muslim MLA in the Cabinet. Besides, Tulsi Silawat (Sanver) and Prabhuram Chowdhary (Sanchi), both former parliamentary secretaries, were also administered the oath. Jaivardhan Singh, the MLA from Raghogarh, and son of senior Congress leader Digvijay Singh, was also inducted into the Cabinet. The Congress returned to power in the state after a hiatus of 15 years.

Though the Congress, with 114 seats, emerged as the single largest party in the 230-member Assembly, it failed to cross the halfway mark on its own and enlisted support of the BSP and the SP, which won two and one seats, respectively.

In Chhattisgarh, Baghel gave representation to leaders from all sections and regions. Patel administered the oath of office to the new ministers at the Police Parade Ground. The portfolios are yet to be announced.

Senior Congress leader PL Punia, Baghel and other leaders were present on the occasion. Those who took oath on Tuesday included Mohammad Akbar, Ravindra Choubey, Jaisingh Agrawal and Umesh Patel. Four-time MLA and former minister Akbar is the alone Muslim face in the Cabinet. Similarly, seven-time MLA Choubey is the only member from the Brahmin community in the Cabinet.

Two other Congress legislators, TS Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu, took oath as ministers on December 17, after Baghel was sworn in as the chief minister. The Chhattisgarh cabinet can have 13 ministers at most, including the chief minister. The Congress returned to power here after 15 years, dislodging the Raman Singh-led BJP government. The Congress bagged 68 of the total 90 seats in the Assembly, while the BJP won only 15 seats.

Tapping into the emerging trend of e-commerce platforms finding traction in the middle income segment, online supermarket Grofers, which has shifted to a low-cost inventory-led model, plans to compete with fast moving consumer players by catering to the desire for 'aspirational' products with its in-house brand of affordable consumer goods. ""The next trend of growth in online market and in general will come from middle (income) India... so the focus is on affordability. Around 50 million Indians are very, very premium. The next 400 million is where the actual economy lies. Doing more FMCG is just a part of making products more affordable,"" co-founder and CEO Albinder Dhindsa told FE in an interview.

""It is fundamentally unfair if people pay the same price here for FMCG products that people pay in the US. That is basically because we have poor distribution, they have better distribution. For example there is literally no reason why Axe deo is cheaper in US than it is in India. It takes away the ability of a large market to access these products. We want to solve these problems,""said Dhindsa. In July, Grofers forayed into the FMCG segment with launch of seven new brands under categories Budget and Popular G, offering both premium and entry-level quality products across various segments like food and beverages, personal care, household care, oral care, furniture and storage, kitchen tools and accessories among others.

Saurabh Kumar, founder, Grofers, told FE that having savings and pricing at par with DMart is just the starting point. The company seeks to capitalise on its cost-effective back-end infrastructure, lacking in most other brands to make cheaper consumer goods available to the masses. This is what Grofers calls its 'market disruption' game plan, which will drive its second phase of growth. Dhindsa said the online firm's five-year plan is to 'make products more affordable'. This will open up the 400 million market out of which Grofers taps 600,000 every month. East Delhi and old side of Gurgaon is the biggest market for the company and its strategy is to penetrate deeper into these areas.

The domestic FMCG market dominated by the likes of Hindustan Unilever, ITC, Colgate-Palmolive faced major disruption when Baba Ramdev-led Patanjali Ayurved leveraged the growing popularity of natural segment and filled shelves with cheap products. Many companies changed strategies and introduced their own variants of organic to counter Patanjali. ""You need to fundamentally understand where the dichotomy of these FMCG brands lie. It is very difficult to come with products in all the ranges. Their fundamental structure does not change. Right from manufacturer to that product showing up on customer doorstep, in each of these steps, there are logistics costs involved, storage costs involved, margins involved. All of that goes away in our case,"" Kumar said.

""We are working with our manufacturers where we are helping them become more efficient, so they are able to make products cheaper for us and then we are removing all the layers that exists between manufacturers to customers. In case of other FMCG's all these entails additional costs which is passed on to customers"". Rival BigBasket has acquired a controlling stake in smart vending machine startup Kwik24 as part of its better customer outreach which helps them instantly stock up fresh produce and FMCG products.

Grofers is on track to meet its FY19 revenue target of Rs 2,500 crore, Kumar said. It is already breaking even in Delhi-NCR and hopes to become profitable in all 13 markets by FY20. However, Dhindsa said that the company's losses will not reduce as it makes half of its losses from investments in warehouses. ""Recently, our losses have gone down on the supply chain side but then we have spent aggressively on inventory, launching new products. At some point of time, may be we have to cut down on our marketing spend. But we do not take losses on products,"" Dhindsa said. Losses rose to Rs 268.3 crore in FY17 from Rs 225.11 crore losses posted in FY16, according to data sourced from Tofler."

Both Nath and Baghel, along with senior state functionaries, held separate meetings with party president Rahul Gandhi in the national capital over the weekend to discuss the cabinet expansions.

Behind this diktat, lies the politicos' anxiety that dissenters may sneak in as audience members, turn the black clothing into a flag and thus leave a black mark on their image building programme. This past year saw multiple instances of individuals being denied entry to political rallies for the sin of wearing black, being asked to take off their clothing and even having had the colour of their inner wear inspected.

BJP's fear of black

For Prime Minister Narendra Modi's public meeting in Jaipur on 7 July -- he was scheduled to interact with beneficiaries of a government scheme -- unsuspecting audience members were summarily told to discard their black clothing or leave. A heap of clothes -- mufflers, handkerchiefs, bags, jackets, caps, socks and inner wear -- was seen piling up at the entrance. Those who donned black shirts or pants stood helpless outside the venue, pleading with security to let them in, to no avail.

It was later reported that local administration was given strict instructions to prohibit any black items to avoid a repeat of the 8 March public rally in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan. At this event, when Modi was on stage with the then chief minister Vasundhara Raje, a few disgruntled contract workers disrupted Raje's speech by waving black flags and raising slogans. A Jaipur-based journalist who did not wish to be identified said that after this incident, police became extra cautious about not allowing in black clothing to enter such high-profile events.

In January, BJP president Amit Shah and Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a rally in Varanasi. The authorities refused entry to individuals wearing black. In October, Shah addressed a women's convention in Chhattisgarh. The same protocol was followed and pictures of black clothing being confiscated at the entrance of the venue went viral. It was also reported that women's undergarments were inspected and searched, all to ensure no black flags were smuggled into the venue.

A senior journalist -- working for an international publication -- covering this event witnessed this first-hand. Requesting anonymity, the journalist narrated how each person entering the venue was inspected diligently. A local journalist pointed out how at the time, the then state Congress president Bhupesh Baghel -- now Chhattisgarh chief minister -- was jailed over a sex CD case and that Congress members threatened to show black flags to BJP leadership to express dissent at his arrest. The journalist said it was this threat which spurred on vigilance about black clothing from the administration.

In September, a balloon seller in Madhya Pradesh's Satna was arrested and taken to court because the black balloons he sold were released -- in protest -- at a convention presided over by the then chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. In August, Uttar Pradesh-based journalist Kumari Ranjana -- a veteran political scribe -- detailed in a Facebook post how, at an event, a member of Chouhan's security team objected to her black dupatta.

In her post, she said that while she had often heard and read about this, it was the first time this was happening to her in an 18-year career. Ranjana said she refused to give in and walked past security. Ranjana said she didn't take this incident seriously and has not been stopped on other occasions, perhaps because she's a regular face at government programmes.

Though Babu's later demonstrations against Adityanath -- blocking his convoy and jumping on his car -- attracted criminal charges, he was earlier jailed for merely waving black flags at Adityanath (from across the road) and sloganeering: as this reporter witnessed.

The BJP's alleged intolerance of black flags goes back more than a year. As per a report from Dehradun, last December, even as Modi held a rally in the Himalayan state capital, the public was asked to remove their black clothing and headgear despite the biting cold.

Congress no better

The Congress isn't immune from this black flag phobia either. While Rajasthan's new chief minister Ashok Gehlot and his deputy Sachin Pilot criticised Modi and Raje for barring the entry of people wearing black at their rallies and called them ""paranoid"", they made no mention of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's November rally in Chhattisgarh, which also saw individuals wearing black being halted at the gate.

This reporter, wearing a black T-shirt, was barred from entering the venue in Bastar. The Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) men at the gate said they had orders from above, although they failed to specify who issued the order (despite persistent questioning). One CRPF jawan pleaded, ""Sir, please understand. Change your T-shirt. You can have my shirt, but we can't let you in with black clothes. You and I have no bad blood, but if we let you in wearing black, we might lose our jobs.""

On seeking the intervention of senior Chhattisgarh Congress leader TS Singh Deo -- who was in the race for the chief minister's post -- this reporter was informed (by his personal assistant) in no uncertain terms that if the T-shirt was not changed, the reporter would be not be allowed to enter the venue. Five days later, this reporter was stopped at the gate of Modi's election rally in Ambikapur for the same reason.

Whodunnit

Uttar Pradesh BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said he has received complaints of people being denied entry at party events for wearing black. He said the party has given no such instructions and that it is the local authorities who undertake such initiatives to impress their political masters. Tripathi said such criticism is a sign of a healthy democracy. He recalled how, as a student leader, he showed black flags to politicos on more than one occasion. He further added that action should be taken against protesters only when security is breached.

Dinesh Tripathi, Superintendent of Police (City Range) Saharanpur -- where Modi addressed a rally in April -- said officers aren't given any written or oral orders regarding barring people in black. He said police act on their own to prevent any black flag protest. Samajwadi Party spokesperson Abdul Hafiz Gandhi said criticism, including showing black flags to politicians, is part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. He said it has become commonplace to harass those who show up at political rallies wearing black and called this scrutiny ""illegal"".

Journalist Indrajit Singh -- who has been in the professional since the days of Indira Gandhi -- noted that the politicos' intolerance of black flags is a new phenomenon. He said leaders such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee stopped their convoy and heard the protesters out, but today's politicians lack such pluck.

""Such a protest is considered healthy for a democracy,"" Singh said. ""Everyone has a right to do so. However, this new trend of not barring people at public gatherings, stopping journalists or charging those protesting in this manner with serious criminal offences is most unfortunate.""

In a first expansion of his Cabinet, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel on December 26 inducted nine MLAs, including a woman legislator, as ministers.

With this, the strength of the Baghel-led Cabinet has gone up to 12.

While the state Congress leaders hailed the Cabinet expansion for giving representation to leaders from all sections and regions, the opposition BJP said it showed ""differences"" within the ruling party.

Governor Anandiben Patel administered the oath of office to the new ministers during a function held at the Police Parade Ground here.

Senior Congress leader P L Punia, Chief Minister Baghel and other leaders were present on the occasion.

Two other Congress legislators - T S Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu - had taken oath as ministers on December 17, after Baghel was sworn in as the chief minister.

Those who took oath on December 25 included Mohammad Akbar, Ravindra Choubey, Jaisingh Agrawal and Umesh Patel.

Four-time MLA and former minister Akbar is the lone Muslim face in the Cabinet. He won the recently held state election by the highest margin of 59,284 votes against his BJP rival in Kawardha seat, the home town of former chief minister Raman Singh.

Similarly, seven-time MLA Choubey is the lone member from the Brahmin community in the Cabinet.

Ravindra Choubey, who won from Saja seat, had served as minister in the Ajit Jogi-led Congress government in Chhattisgarh (2000-2003) and was earlier also the leader of opposition in the state assembly (2008-2013).

Second time MLA Umesh Patel, son of former state Congress chief Nandkumar Patel who was killed in the Maoist attack in Jhiram valley of Bastar in 2013, retained his Kharsia seat in the election.

Jaisingh Agrawal was elected for the third consecutive time from Korba seat.

Woman MLA Anila Bhedia, and Kawasi Lakhma and Premsai Singh Tekam were the tribal leaders inducted into the Cabinet.

Tekam, who became MLA for the sixth time, defeated the previous BJP government's home minister Ramsewak Paikra in Pratappur seat.

Tekam had served as minister in the previous governments in Chhattisgarh and in erstwhile undivided Madhya Pradesh.

Lakhma, a five-time MLA from Konta seat, is the party's prominent tribal leader while Bhediya, wife of former IPS officer Ravindra Bhedia, has been elected for the second time from Daundi Lohara seat.

State Congress's working president and three-time MLA Shiv Kumar Dahariya and two-time MLA Guru Rudra Kumar, both belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) community, were also sworn in as ministers.

Daharia won the Arang seat this time, while Guru Rudra Kumar, who hails from the Guru family of Satnami sect, largely followed by people of the schedule caste community, won from Ahiwara seat.

Umesh Patel, 34, is the youngest member in the state Cabinet while Tamradhwaj Sahu, 69, is the eldest.

The Chhattisgarh cabinet can have 13 ministers at most, including the chief minister

According to the party leaders, the remaining minister will also be finalised soon.

State Congress communication wing head Shailesh Nitin Trivedi told PTI that after receiving a huge mandate, it was a challenging task for Chief Minister Baghel to select his ministers as several senior and experienced leaders have won.

""But, he successfully met the challenge and formed a balanced Cabinet giving representation to leaders from all sections and regions,"" he said.

Though some senior leaders could not make it to the Cabinet, the party respects all of them and they will be given appropriate positions, Trivedi said.

""Now we have the target to win all 11 Lok Sabha seats in the state in next year's general elections,"" he added.

BJP spokesperson Sachchidanand Upasane said it was expected that senior leaders with administrative skills will be given berths in the Cabinet, but it seemed that the chief minister wanted to keep all the rights with him.

""This Cabinet will function with the remote control in Baghel's hands,"" he said.

Upasane claimed the Cabinet formation ""clearly reflects differences among leaders within the ruling party"" as all the sections were not properly covered in it.

There was a voice of dissent with senior Congress leader and former minister Amitesh Shukla boycotting the oath ceremony to protest his being left out of the ministry. Talking to the media, he said that he and his family were associated with Gandhi family for the last three decades. ""I expect justice from Gandhi family,"" Shukla said.

Congress spokesperson and senior leader RP Singh, however, said that not giving ministerial berth to Shukla was an internal matter of the party. ""There is no infighting. This is an internal matter and we will discuss the whole issue in our party forum,"" Singh said.

Shankaracharya Adhokshajanand Deo Tuesday demanded that the BJP clear its stand over remarks by the party's leaders on Lord Hanuman.

""On one side the BJP, from time to time, has been bringing up the Ram temple issue and on the other, its leaders are making absurd remarks on Hindu gods and goddesses, hurting religious sentiments,"" Shankaracharya Adhokshajanand Deo Tirth said here.

""The Ram temple in Ayodhya will be incomplete without Lord Hanuman as Ram had himself praised Hanumanji terming Hanuman equal to his brother Bharat,"" he said.

If the remark made by Nawab has the BJP high-command's approval, ""then the party will have to get a mosque constructed for Lord Hanuman"", the seer said.

The chief minister had hurt religious sentiments by terming Lord Hanuman a Dalit, even as his office later issued a clarification, claiming that Adityanath was misquoted, the shankaracharya said.

Lord Hanuman has been termed a Jat, Thakur, a sportsman and even a Muslim, even though gods and goddesses are above caste and religion, he stated.

Uttar Pradesh Sports Minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan had said on Sunday that Hanuman was a sportsperson.

However, he had dismissed his party colleagues' attempts at identifying the deity's caste and said gods don't have castes.

The seer asked the BJP to clear its stand on the remarks and claimed no clarification was issued by the party on the statements on Lord Hanuman.

""The silence by BJP higher ups and RSS functionaries (on the remarks on Lord Hanuman) indicates that for the BJP, the Ram temple is a tool to garner votes,"" he said, adding that the temple in Ayodhya will be constructed by seers and dharmacharyas.

In a meeting held in Vrindavan, the coordinator of the Mathura Nagar Nigam Tara Chandra Goshwami also condemned the remarks of BJP leaders on Hindu gods and goddesses.

The state government, in a GO in July 2018, clearly instructed that a class 10 student should not be asked to carry more than a 5kg school bag. For a class 1 student, the cap was at 1.5kg. Recently, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) released an order on the same lines and directed states to implement it.

Parents said that implementation has always been a problem in the state and added that the state rule or the one passed by the MHRD will not make any impact.

""My sons are studying in class 3 and class 5 in a private school in the city and they are still carrying bags which weigh no less than 8kgs. There has been zero impact at the ground level and most of the schools are still make kids carry a heavy load. The students too got used to the baggage and want to carry all their books to schools and back to home,"" said Venkata Sainath, a parent.

Another parent Uma V, whose son is studying in class 8, said, ""my son's school bag is so heavy that we have to drop him at the school daily despite the school being located at a walkable distance. There is no way he can carry the load."" Parents said that students also have to carry extra weight in the form of skates, yoga mats among other things to pursues cocurricular activities.

Education department officials, on the other hand, have clarified their position. They said that they are conducting random checks to make sure that schools are following the guidelines.

""We have already directed deputy district education officers to visit schools during the morning hours and weigh the school bags of students before they enter the campus. If they notice any discrepancies, a notice will be issued to the schools,"" said B Venkata Narasamma, district education officer (DEO) of Hyderabad."

This summer, the Savitri biopic Mahanati paid a fitting tribute to the iconic actor. Nag Ashwin, the director of this cradle-to-grave biopic, reminisces, ""Mayabazar and Missamma are among my favourite films of Savitri amma; one of the reasons I wanted to make the biopic was to recreate scenes from her films.""

Nag Ashwin, the art director, cinematographer, costume and production department researched for a year. They also spoke to veterans like director Singeetam Srinivasa Rao who had assisted director K V Reddy for Mayabazar (1957). Nag explains, ""We learnt that they shot on film, developed it to check the colours and changed the curtains until they got the right shade of grey for the black and white film. Mayabazar was simple, endearing and a work of masters. We learnt about lighting and camera set-ups through Singeetam garu.""

Nag Ashwin was excited and scared while filming these portions. Word got around when they were working on the 'Aha Naa Pellanta' song and more than 20 directors turned up to observe the shooting. This song was picturised after nearly 80% of Mahanati was filmed and Keerthy Suresh was at ease playing Savitri. The jewellery had been designed to match the original and Gaurang Shah designed a lehenga that matched Savitri's. ""We worked double shifts for two days. We had our own interpretation of how Savitri and SV Ranga Rao would have conversed during the making of Mayabazar, and we did that with Keerthy and Mohanbabu. Keerthy went through 20 to 25 takes of the sequence and by the 18th or 19th time, I felt she had cracked it. We had filmed a longer sequence and edited about 20 seconds to contain the film's length.""

Viewers of the Tamil version, Nadigaiyar Thilagam, had rightfully pointed out the lack of enough representation of Savitri's films with Sivaji Ganesan and MGR. The original plan was to shoot 10 days specially for the Tamil version: ""But the actors I had in mind didn't want to enact these roles, just like actors here hesitated to play NTR. We didn't have enough resources to create Sivaji Ganesan through CG. We had already overshot the budget and at that time, it seemed like a huge risk to push further.""

Headlined by actor and co-writer Adivi Sesh, this slick and racy spy thriller brought back Supriya Yarlagadda to the screens after 22 years as a hard-nosed boss who delivers some serious punches. Goodachari was also a hat tip to homegrown spy flicks like Goodachari 116 (1967) and Agent Gopi (1978). Among the several aspects that deserved to be appreciated, is a single shot action sequence that unfolds in the pre-climax portions, over 1 minute 20 seconds. Shaneil Deo's hand-held camera captures every single move of the actors. For writer-director Sashi Kiran Tikka and everyone involved, this sequence required precision planning.

Sesh remembers, ""An evening prior to filming this sequence, Shaneil came in and asked us 'bhai, achcha hai, par khaas kya hai (it's nice but what's special?)' He felt that we had to better the pre-interval sequence that had shaped up really well.""

They cancelled the shoot and went back to the drawing board to discuss ideas. They decided to attempt a single take action sequence, taking a cue from Hollywood films. ""You can't hide stuntmen anywhere in the frame to double up for the actors, or have anyone around giving cues. The actors will have to do it all themselves and the camera has to capture every minute move,"" says Sesh.

They rehearsed for three days, filming the sequence on their DSLRs and iPhones to evaluate. Walkie-talkies were hidden in the clothes of the actors so that the director could give cues. However, there were niggles: ""We rehearsed wearing t-shirts and shorts and our moves were quick. During the shoot I was wearing a heavy leather jacket which restricted my movement. Accordingly Shaneil's camera had to slow down."" It took eight takes for them to get it right and ultimately, they used the seventh take.

""It was fun, fascinating and gratifying to see the story I had visualised in my head a thousand times over, taking shape into a film,"" says Rahul Ravindran. Chi La Sow signalled the sure-footed debut of a writer-director who swept aside clichés. Chi La Sow is our Before Sunrise kind of film, with a strong yet vulnerable female protagonist and a man-child who tries to understand the serious side of life, all in one night. Sushanth and Ruhani Sharma were the lifeline of the film that unfolds in a conversational style.

Chi La Sow was appreciated for its gender sensitivity at every step. Women viewers loved it, and so did the men. ""I felt touched that a number of people took time off to share their thoughts through long Facebook posts or blogs. I came across different interpretations; even the smallest of things was noticed,"" says Rahul.

Rahul was clear that it would be a niche film, earn the team goodwill and make decent profits. In this largely dialogue-driven film, one stand-out sequence hardly used words. Remember the staircase episode where Sushanth spots Ruhani who's reluctant to head home and tell her mother that the alliance didn't work out? The portion was conceived sans any dialogue, but effectively portraying her dilemma and Sushanth's mixed feelings of guilt. It wasn't his fault, he wasn't ready for marriage. But he empathises with her plight and what follows is a reflection of that. The unit was concerned if people would relate to the emotions of the lead characters without any spoken word. After much discussion, Rahul made Ruhani say just one line -- 'nakku maa amma kaavali'. Prashant Vihari's score was the perfect foil to the proceedings.

Another heartwarming moment is the interaction between Sushanth and Ruhani's mother Rohini in the hospital. If you've missed this film in theatres, look out for a telecast on Gemini TV and perhaps Sun Next for digital streaming, soon."

PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh told the newspaper that the university has requisitioned the present status of 156 such endowments and 'funds' from different banks and post offices. ""The money lying in these accounts is so meagre that it can hardly be used to disburse the scholarship or any gold medal to the students. Hence, the university is approaching the donors or their dependents for contributing some additional amount and reviving the defunct endowments. Some of them have already agreed to extend their help in getting these endowments revived,"" Singh said.

The university has also been trying to award gold medals to the toppers of different examinations from the next convocation. PU has already appealed to its alumni to donate Rs four lakh each for the institution of gold medals in their names. Around eight alumni have already come forward and many more are in the queue, he said.

PU has stopped awarding gold medals to the best performers in different undergraduate and postgraduate examinations due to demise of several endowments and gold medal funds created from the liberal donations of the kings of erstwhile princely estates, landlords and academicians in pre-independence days.

The 'defunct' gold medal funds include Gait English Gold Medal Fund, Shrimati Radhika Sinha Gold Medal Fund, Gidhaur Gold Medal Fund, Madhava Medal and Prize Fund, Shaw Memorial Medal Fund, Rabindra Nath Mukherjee Gold Medal Fund, Sifton Gold Medal Fund, I N Chandra Gold Medal Fund, Mcpherson Gold Medal Fund, Justice Kulwant Sahay Gold Medal Fund, Langat Singh Gold Medal Fund, Sir Ali Imam Gold Medal Fund, and V K N Menon Gold Medal Fund.

Some other notable endowments are Indian History Culture Maharaja Darbhanga Readership Fund, Banaili Economics Readership Fund, Dr S K Sinha Readership Fund, J N Tata Chair in Geology Fund, Maharaja Darbhanga Maithili Development Fund, Sir Ganesh Dutt Singh's Trust Fund, Bailey Memorial Library Fund and Hathwa Raj Scholarship Fund.

Besides these endowments at the university level, a number of such endowments at college level have also become defunct now. At least 15 endowments -- John Ambulance Association scholarship, Wilson memorial prize, Russel memorial fund, Durgawati memorial fund, R N memorial prize, A C Pandey scholarship, Deo Dutt Tripathi scholarship, Basawan Singh Chhattavritti and Syed Kaji Raza Hussain Jayanti Chhatravriti -- are lying dead at Patna College, Patna University Teachers' Association president Randhir Kumar Singh said.

The proposal for the alternative road gained momentum after the Kate Wasti to Rakshak Chowk road was closed down following a Bombay High Court order in 2015. It has been over three years since then, but precious little has happened on the stretch, putting Pimple Saudagar residents, mostly IT professionals, in a spot.

The residents are currently forced to drive their four-wheelers for 4km extra (up and down), ending up paying Rs 8,000 extra per year. The two-wheeler riders end up paying about Rs 2,000-3,000 per year in fuel cost for the same distance.

The road has been on the development plan (DP) for years now. The residents have repeatedly raised the issue in various forums, but all in vain. The latest round of joint demarcation was last done on June 5, 2018, but awaits nod from the DEO and the Army authorities, who will have to cede land at a cost to be paid by the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation.

Presently, the DEO is examining the map and will give suggestions and objections, if any. What remains unclear and what no-one is able to answer satisfactorily is that what is the purpose of a ""joint survey with all stakeholders present"" if it has to run so many iterations.

At the Smart City presentation by civic chief Shravan Hardikar recently, he had told the residents that the matter was with the defence office and being examined at the 'central level' by the officials. The residents have taken up the matter with former defence minister Manohar Parrikar and incumbent, Nirmala Sitharaman.

The city survey office was sitting on the map for over three months before it was passed onto PCMC, which subsequently sent it to the DEO. An official at the DEO told TOI, ""The map came to us only in the first week of December. We will compare it with the old maps and see if the demarcation still holds. We will then send it to the Army who will decide if they want to cede the required land and the cost at which they will cede it."""

In this excerpt from the book Dipa Karmakar: The Small Wonder, the Olympian gymnast describes her journey to the bronze medal at the 2014 Commonweath Games.

Ahead of the CWG 2014, I was in a better frame of mind. My fitness levels were absolutely fine. I had speed. I had power. And most of all, I had the zeal and courage to perform. I felt enthusiastic and the vaulting table looked exciting. Fear never touched me while performing any difficult exercise in gymnastics. Among gymnasts, one's courage and hard work are the two most important differentiating factors. Besides, I have huge faith in my coach. Faith generates courage. So, I was ready to do any amount of hard work for the most difficult vault in gymnastics history -- the Produnova.

This vault is named after a famous gymnast of Russia called Yelena Produnova. She first performed it in 1999. Everyone was pretty shell-shocked when she executed it; the very nature of the vault has led to it being nicknamed the 'vault of death'. But I never thought of it like that. Even Nandi sir [Dipa's coach Bishweshwar Nandi] detested this name. I knew of his concern but it never bothered me, even though it had been completed by only a few in the world. That became an additional incentive for me to be a part of an elite league. Yelena Produnova of Russia, Yamilet Pena of Dominican Republic, Fadwa Mahmoud of Egypt, and my hero Oksana Chusovitina of Uzbekistan were the only gymnasts who had completed this difficult but immensely beautiful vault in a competition.

I was practising really hard for the coming CWG. Six to eight hours every day. I used to do eight to ten repetitions every day. We used to spend almost six hours for vaulting exercises and around two hours in conditioning exercises. It was not easy at all. In fact it was quite painful. Sometimes I used to cry a lot and complain to Nandi sir that I was not a machine. Sometimes, he used to allow me to rest. But then I used to cry and say, ""I will keep doing it. I want to see how many times you can force me to do it again and again."" We didn't have smooth times. He forced me to practice hard and I fought a lot. Before going to the Glasgow CWG I had done the Produnova around five or six hundred times and we were quite satisfied. I had attained a level of perfection on the classic Produnova vault.

As we reached Scotland, we wanted to start our practice session as soon as we could. But my start in Scotland proved to be a difficult one. In the qualification round, during the warm-up time itself, my ankle got hurt. But, I performed all the exercises with a hurt ankle, even the Produnova.

Nandi sir was really angry. He left all of us and went to his room. Later I was told that he cried a lot. His complaint was that my attempt for the Produnova itself was wrong. Besides, he was very disheartened. He thought that the Games were over for me before they had even started. He was also scared about what he would tell the authorities and the other members in the team. It had been a struggle for him to gain acceptance within the coaching set-up. He was the outsider and he sort of felt that with this defeat the walls would close on his coaching career in the national team.

Nandi sir is a very emotional man. Since he had locked himself up in his room and wasn't to be seen at the dining hall or within the Village there was no way for anyone to get in touch with him. I was hobbling around and was advised rest. Finally around one in the night some of my teammates decided that it was time to snap him out of his dark mood. He was staying on the second floor in another wing of the building the Indian team was put up in.

The girls shouted, ""Nandi sir, Didi (Dipa) has qualified."" That did it. He did not believe it. He came running to the ground floor to crosscheck whether it was a prank. They told him that I had come seventh in the qualification round and had reached the final. The transformation was immediate.

He came to meet me the next morning and immediately took me to meet the doctor in the Games Village. The doctor saw my swollen ankle and told me that it appeared to be a hairline fracture. He asked us to get an X-ray done and gave me some painkillers meanwhile. I took the painkillers and other medicines but I preferred to wrap my foot tightly with a crepe bandage than get an X-ray done. It was a peculiar situation. Here was I, on the cusp of achieving a dream that had dominated four years of my life and I was not sure whether I could even compete. The crushing defeat in Delhi and the taunts that I had endured had carried me through till this day. I did not want to finish out of the medals and face ridicule again. The anger and the stubbornness kicked in. Goodbye X-ray. To hell with it. I was willing to have my ankle in a cast for the next three months or even six months. You do hear of sportspersons digging deep and finding that little bit extra when they need it the most. This was when I needed to find that extra few per cent which would give me the strength to ignore the pain.

The final was to happen three days later on the 31st of July. I could not practice for another three days. But Nandi sir was still confident that I would do well. We did keep training, just enough to keep the body in shape. Nothing fancy, nothing hard that would cause the ankle more discomfort. I used to say that I would surely get a medal but sir would always ask me to keep mum. He always has been a very superstitious man. I had nothing to lose and I decided to go for it. The team knew I was injured, they just didn't know the fire raging within to not quit.

As I stood at the top of my mark on the day of the final, I just thought one thing. Keep it simple. Land the vault and ignore the pain. The first vault was going to be the most important one. It was the Tsukahara 360. If I could not land it then it was over as the Produnova would need a much bigger effort and there is only that much an injured ankle can take. I set off, eyes on the beat board and nothing else. There was no stopping me; momentarily the pain had gone and I hit the vault perfectly. The landing was not the best; I was not in control and I fleetingly stepped over the red line and was docked a 0.1 penalty as well. But importantly the ankle held up. As I walked back to the top of my mark I made eye contact with sir and gestured to fix the beat board for the next attempt. I glanced up at the large monitor to catch a replay and was very happy with the aggression I showed. The score soon flashed on the display board. Despite the not-so-great landing, I had scored a 13.633. I was way off the pace as far as the medal hunt was concerned. Later I realised it was the lowest score among all eight finalists on the first attempt.

To win a medal, I needed a big one. I knew I had the Produnova coming up. I felt good. The ankle was not hurting. Everyone else -- the coaches, the finalists, and the judges -- knew I was going to attempt it. It was a hit or miss moment; if I landed it, it would give me a lot of points. My other competitors had all decided to play safe. The highest difficulty level, attempted apart from me, was a 5.600 by England's Claudia Fragapane. The Produnova had a difficulty rating of 7.00.

The crowd too knew that this was going to be a difficult vault. As I stood at the top of my mark the whistles and the cheering gradually ceased. There was pin drop silence as I thundered down the mat. I had done this on a daily basis in New Delhi. It was the easiest vault in the world. I knew it was mine. I knew this was in the bag.

I hit the beat board, got the elevation and landed on my feet. The crowd went wild. The emotions came pouring out. Usually I do not react much after a vault. Not that day, though. Within a second of landing I knew that I had just sent shockwaves throughout world gymnastics. A huge smile appeared on my face. I do not know what took over me; it was perhaps the release of the tension and the stress. That ankle be damned. It had done its job and held up.

It was revealed by the amicus curiae Preeti Rane in her comprehensive petition submitted to the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Saturday.

According to her, the city has over 641 hospitals of which, 160 lacks no objection certificate (NOC) of Nagpur Municipal Corporation's (NMC) fire department.

Expressing concern over civic agencies' inaction on ensuring fire safety norms in these hospitals and other high rise buildings in the city, a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi issued notices to the respondents, including state home department and directorate of Maharashtra fire services academy, asking them to reply within eight weeks.

The court was hearing a suo motu plea (PIL No 112/2018) based on TOI's detailed report regarding 782 buildings that were found unsafe during an inspection by fire and emergency services department (FESD), out of 1,758 high-rise structures. NMC commissioner, its chief fire officer and assistant director of town planning (ADTP) and Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) chairman are the other respondents.

Last year, a similar suo motu PIL (No 63/2017) was filed on media report highlighting 2,358 high-rise buildings in the city, which failed to obtain certificates from the city's fire department even after over two and half decades. The report mentioned about NMC fire department's records revealing that in 1989, only three buildings were granted occupancy certificates out of 70. Rest of the 67 builders neither appealed nor obtained it, thus making complete mockery of rules. It was, however, disposed of in the first hearing, after the NMC filed an affidavit assuring to implement stringent measures to ensure that all such high-rises have fire safety measures.

amicus curiae Preeti Rane disclosed that the NMC failed to do anything after that affidavit which led to the jump in number of such structures in the city. While citing another TOI report, she pointed out that even the NMC's own headquarters in the Civil Lines is also unsafe due to failure to implement fire safety measures.

Her contentions were opposed by NMC counsel Jemini Kasat, who stated that the civic body was complying with rules and regulations.

TOI exposed that all these 782 buildings lack firefighting equipment which is mandatory as per the 'Maharashtra Fire Prevention and Life Safety Measures Act, 2006'. Rane asserted that this number has risen to over thousands in the city, primarily due to inaction by the civic authorities, which puts lives of hundreds of visitors in peril.

Quoting chief fire officer's report, Rane informed that many big showrooms like Tajshree Honda and Gurudeo Motors Service Station at Deo Nagar, Chaudhari Lifestyle on Ring Road, and Gowardhan Builders and developers at Mahal. Another 90 buildings are also unsafe that included Fortune Mall, Panjwani Market, Government Ayurvedic College, and Nagpur Zilla Cooperative Bank. She also quoted recent incidents at ESIC Hospital in Mumbai where about six died."

What do you feel about SAI rowing centres?

Most of the centres are not in good condition. Currently, many centres in the country are getting revamped. SAI also need good coaches and equipment. SAI rowing centre in Kerala, which is under the supervision of coach Saji Thomas, is in good shape. The other centre which is in good shape is SAI Jagatpur where the coach is PT Paulose.

How can the government and SAI play a role in improving the future for Indian rowers?

Government is supporting us, but more response is required. Support in funding, fulfilment of required equipment and all other essential things need to be addressed by them on regular basis.

What type of support do coaches need from the government?

Indian coaches need to be given the same payment as foreign coaches. The government should also treat medal winners and coaches equally. Coaches should be felicitated in the same manner as the medal winners.

In what way are Army personnel playing their role in the Indian rowing scenario?

It is because of the Army that Indian rowing is still standing tall, and is even considered one of the better teams in Asia. Army coaches, staff all are helping the sport to reach to a greater level.

How is the national rowing championship going?

The current 37th championship is running very smoothly. Except for West Bengal, every state is here and from what I have seen, it is running very well. After Maharashtra, such rowing facilities are only available in Madhya Pradesh.

How are you looking at the national and international tournaments keeping in mind the upcoming World Championship 2019 and Tokyo 2020 Olympics?

After the present championship we will select our rowers who can be part of the team in world championship 2019 to be held in Austria. We need to build strong teams which can compete against the European teams.We have kept separate events for Army background rowers because rowers outside the Army cannot match up to the Army ones.

What are your views on talent in the women's section?

Actually, I am very disappointed with the SAI centres, who are not able to produce any women medal winners. I don't see any women rower who is capable of representing India at the Olympic level. Being a women president it feels very bad.

Do we need foreign coaches in rowing?

I am not in favour of foreign coaches. In the past, we had three foreign coaches and we imbibed a lot of things from them, but we do have a lot of experts from our own county who understands our rowers well. National coach Ismail Baig is doing a great job right now."

Around 30 crows and pigeons had died mysteriously in Nayabazaar, Badapadaia, Atharbanki, Neheruabangla and Sandhkuda in Paradip. An alert was sounded and surveillance intensified in the coastal pockets.

Nearly 1.75 lakh students from Classes I to VIII in 1,381 Government schools are being provided with MDM. Every Wednesday and Saturday, eggs are being served to each student. Following bird flu scare, panicked parents and students urged the school authorities not to supply eggs in the noon meals.

Sarat Kanungo, headmaster of a Government-run school, said, ""We had no intention to provide bananas and 'pakodas' under MDM scheme. But following pressure from the parents, we distributed these snacks to students.""

Meanwhile, the move has not been taken lightly by the School and Mass Education department.

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

It was a three-act play that left the audience -- as well as the cast -- suitably surprised. But Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who directed the drama with some help from party seniors, may want to look out for the next act.

The party's three leaders -- Kamal Nath, Ashok Gehlot and Bhupesh Bhagel -- earned their jobs in Bhopal, Jaipur and Raipur, respectively, not just through grit and hard work, but because of some last-minute, behind-the-scene deliberations, too. There was some arm-twisting, and a fair bit of cajoling -- but Gandhi managed to hold his own.

The selection of the chief ministerial candidate for Chhattisgarh proved to be the trickiest. Perhaps the Congress high command had not anticipated a landslide victory in the state, and had made little preparations for the change. The December 11 verdict offered Gandhi four options. Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo was a suave and experienced hand but his feudal background stood against the former Sarguja ruler. Tamradhwaj Sahu, the Congress MP from Durg, was backed by AICC point man PL Punia but had been fielded at the last minute to win over the influential Sahu samaj. The resourceful and worldly-wise Charan Das Mahant, a former Union minister, was among the contenders. And then there was Baghel, Chhattisgarh Congress unit chief.

Baghel, who dropped out of college while doing his BSc, had convinced his father to allow him to join the uncertain world of politics by promising him that he would be a chief minister one day. His father, Nand Kumar Baghel, proudly narrated the conversation 37 years later to the media.

But the Congress state chief was not the first choice of the top brass. On December 13, the four contenders were summoned to Delhi for a meeting with Gandhi. The Congress president tried to hammer out a consensus for three hours and decided that Sahu would be the next CM. But Gandhi met with a full-blown rebellion. The other three satraps said they would not work under Sahu.

Another round of consultations followed. This time Singh Deo was the favourite, but now Sahu was ready to revolt. The AICC general secretary in-charge of administration, former chief minister Motilal Vora, was brought in for the negotiations. When the deadlock continued, AICC treasurer Ahmed Patel intervened. Patel backed Baghel and, to Gandhi's astonishment, everyone came around to it, with Mahant putting in a condition that he be made the Speaker of the Assembly.

Rajasthan was not easy either. When former minister Sachin Pilot landed in New Delhi from Jaipur after winning the Tonk seat, he went to meet Gandhi at his residence. Around the same time, Ashok Gehlot, the victor of the Sardarpura seat, was confabulating with Patel at his residence. Hectic lobbying followed. It led to a see-saw battle, which first saw Pilot on top, and then Gehlot as the likely contender, with the former Rajasthan CM having nearly twice the number of MLAs backing him as compared to Pilot.

Gandhi was keen to appoint a ""young face"" in one of the three newly-acquired states, but Gehlot, who comes from a magicians' family, proved to be a crafty customer. It was difficult to convince Pilot to give way. Finally, Gandhi's sister, Priyanka, who has known Pilot since he was a small boy, was roped in, along with their mother, Sonia, to prevail upon him to accept the deputy chief minister's post. And the Gandhi women's pressure worked.

In Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath's appointment as CM was a near-forgone conclusion, till the Rajasthan developments started to affect the neighbouring state. A former royal from Rajasthan is said to have egged the Jyotiraditya Scindia camp on by whispering that if a ""junior"" such as Pilot became a chief minister ahead of the erstwhile maharaja of Gwalior, Scindia -- a four-time Lok Sabha MP -- would trail behind the two-time MP forever. Scindia, who had declined to be state party chief three years ago, was suddenly in the race.

Some serious number-crunching followed. Scindia supporters said they had 26 of the 34 seats in the Gwalior-Chambal region, as against Nath's 24 out of 38 Assembly seats in the Mahakaushal region. That was when former CM Digvijaya Singh took centre-stage, sharing a photograph of 31 newly-elected MLAs calling on his son Jaivardhan, who had won from Raghogarh. The subtle message was that Scindia's support of 26 MLAs meant little when a ""non-contender"" had 31 MLAs behind him. While this battle carried on, Kamal Nath, in Bhopal, messaged party bigwigs to say over 80 MLAs from various parties and groups were with him. Gandhi, however, publicly demonstrated his confidence in Scindia by ensuring that he was by his side when he travelled from Delhi to Jaipur, Bhopal and Raipur for the three swearing-in ceremonies. The idea was to showcase the ""young face"" of the party when, in effect, the old guard was calling the shots.

It's not going to be easy for Gandhi. With the exception of V Narayanaswamy of Puducherry, Gandhi has to contend with four Congress chief ministers -- Nath, Gehlot, Baghel and Amarinder Singh in Punjab -- who not only have a streak of independence in them but also a direct line to the party's powerful old guard. The play is still on."

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

In case of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, district education officer Sangita Sinha on her visit to the school found that the attendance register had caste of students mentioned before their names.

She added they had no intention of hurting the sentiments of anyone.

In case of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua, no separate classroom was found. However, students had their castes mentioned before their names.

Responding to questions on Wednesday, in the backdrop of the Supreme Court dismissing petitions seeking a probe into the Rs 59,000 crore deal with France for 36 Rafale fighters, ACM Dhanoa had said the acquisition of the jets was a critical operational necessity for his force.

""We are saying we need the Rafales. The government is saying we need them. The SC, which has given a good judgment, has said the IAF needs them. It has taken us so long to get the fighters, and in the meantime our regional adversaries or neighbours have upgraded (their military capabilities),"" he said.

""I will not go into the politics of it because it is a separate issue. But I don't think there is any technical argument against the aircraft as such. Everybody agrees it's a good aircraft and that we need it given our strategic scenario,"" he added.

This time Congress president Rahul Gandhi is being targeted on social media for a viral photo which shows TS Singh Deo, a cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh. In the viral photo, Deo, who is much older to Gandhi, is seen bowing to touch his feet.

A Facebook page, 'India against Presstitudes', posted this photograph with a message: ""48-year-old senior blessing his 80-year-old junior. My friend Pappu ji is kind"".

Thousands of people shared this post and hundreds commented on it, attacking Rahul and the Congress culture. Many people even doubted if the picture was photoshopped.

India Today's Fact Check team found that the photograph is real. Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo did indeed bow in front of Rahul.

Other Facebook pages like 'Social Tamasha', 'I support Modi Ji and BJP' also carried this picture with various captions hitting out at the Congress president.

In the photograph, one can see a grey-haired man bowing in front of Rahul. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also standing beside Rahul with a bouquet in hand on the red carpet. Senior Congress leader RPN Singh can also be seen in the crowd.

India Today TV spoke to TS Singh Deo to check the claims made on social media regarding the photograph. He confirmed that this is the venue of the swearing-in ceremony on December 17 and he was present there when Rahul Gandhi arrived. However he did not try to touch Rahul's feet and only shook hands. According to him, the photo is morphed.

But at the same time, Deo himself admitted that he has a habit of taking the blessings of senior party leaders by touching their feet on special occasions irrespective of their age.

""On that day too, I touched feet of the guests sitting on the dais after the oath taking,"" said Singh Deo. ""Just after my taking oath as a minister, I even tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the dais but he stopped me from doing it,"" he added.

Singh Deo indeed touched the feet of the guests on the dais and Rahul Gandhi stopped him; this can be seen in this video.

We could not find any supporting video which would have clearly established the sequence of events captured in the viral photo. But we could also not find any evidence to support the claim of Deo that the picture is morphed.

Moreover, when we pressed upon Deo to describe clearly what had happened at that moment, he gave self-contradictory statements. He even talked about picking up a napkin lying on the floor. But no such napkin is visible in the photo.

Looking closely at the photo, we observed that the shadows were aligned perfectly with the characters, hinting that the image is real.

Rajasthan Patrika, a local newspaper, also carried this viral photo claiming that the minister was actually trying to pick up a thread hanging loosely on the floor from the bouquet in Manmohan Singh's hands. But it can be seen that the thread hanging from the bouquet is nowhere close to the floor. Moreover, Singh Deo is bowing in front of Rahul Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh who is standing few steps away.

We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh, who was also present with Rahul. He confirmed that Singh Deo tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.

Ever since Anjali Kumari, a Class X student of Bihar government-run GA High School in Lalganj, spoke up against the caste-wise sitting arrangement at her school, all benefits she is entitled to under various government schemes have been put on hold, allegedly by the school administration.

On Wednesday, the girl, in a written complaint to Lalganj Block Education Officer (BEO) Arvind Kumar Tiwari, maintained that ""making students enrol and sit in classrooms on lines of caste (social groups) is violation of our fundamental rights.""

Another Class IX student of the school also said the practice has been going for the past four years.

The segregation of students on castelines came to light after the Vaishali District Education Officer sent a team to the school on Monday. A detailed inspection report in this regard has been sent to State Secondary Education Director.

Advertising

According to school records, the GA High School has more than 1,500 students in Classes IX to XII, and castes of each student is mentioned against their names on attendance sheets, reportedly to ""help the school administration to easily identify beneficiaries"" of all government schemes.

The attendance sheets have been seized by the Vaishali District Secondary Education Office.

Under various government schemes, a Class IX student is entitled to Rs 3,000 to purchase a bicycle; girl students from Classes IX to XII are entitled to Rs 1,000 for uniform and Rs 150 for sanitary napkins; students from Classes IX to XII are also entitled to Rs 1800 scholarship annually.

All the benefits are, however, given only against 75 per cent attendance.

Claiming that the report of compliance on government schemes are sought every month, and at times fortnightly, the school's in-charge principal, Meena Kumari, said: ""My predecessor, Phool Mohammed Ansari, had introduced segregation on caste lines in attendance register in 2014 and I have been following it because it has comes as handy to identify beneficiaries and prepare the reports.""

Dismissing the allegations of ""dividing students on caste lines"", she, said: ""One should know that we have only six classrooms, which can accommodate maximum 600 students. As we have a daily attendance of 50-60 per cent, we have to merge two sections (of a class) daily... There is no feeling of discrimination on caste lines. Nor have parents and students complained about it."" Meena Kumari has submitted a written explanations to the DEO.

Lalganj BEO AK Tiwari, however, said: ""Attendance sheets on caste or social category lines is a bad practice. I have not heard of a Bihar school having such registers..."" The BEO added they had warned the school administration about the practice twice after random inspections in 2017.

Vaishali DEO, Sangeeta Sinha, said: ""We had sent an inspection team to the school and found attendance registers in violation of rules. We have sent our report to Director, secondary education."""
"165","1022600959","2018-12-19","https://www.afaqs.com/news/story/54138_New-trends-in-ad-filmmaking","New trends in ad filmmaking","Agencyfaqs!",FALSE,"This year was a year of extremes at our ad-film advisory and analytics vertical. Not only was the number of projects 50 per cent higher than previous years but, more importantly, we handled lots of varied requests that, perhaps, showcased where the industry is heading. On one hand, many clients were seeking international Directors and DOPs (Director of Photography) while there were many others that asked us for a list of local hotshops.

At one end were those who wanted to work with international production houses and ended up making ad films with multi-crore budgets and then there were others who asked us to optimise their cost of production bringing many aspects in-house. I am sharing a few key trends that we witnessed which might be of interest to you, in case you are looking at producing your next ad-film.

There's been a surfeit of International Directors and DOPs in Indian TV commercials. The likes of Mark Toia, Dean Freeman, Jonathan Hyde, and the Salto Brothers are shooting films regularly for Indian brands and the list keeps growing, much to the chagrin of Indian directors and DOPs. The cumulative costs, including their fees, coterie and travel constitutes a major chunk of the total budget but clients and production houses want them nevertheless, for their technical finesse and professionalism. While India has its own share of talent and technical capabilities, if clients have budgets, they would rather go with an international name.

A contrary point of view was expressed by a line producer, ""I really wonder if there is any dearth of talent or equipment in our country. Many a time, foreign Directors don't even understand the local cultural sensibilities. But the plus point of having a foreigner Director is that they are comparatively more organised in terms of prep. Plus, there are better budgets and timelines.""

A related trend is distributed film production. An Ad film today can have an international director and DOP but an Indian post-production house, music director etc. or the other way round. A team is curated across the globe, depending on the script and budgets.

Celebrity Feature Film Directors

Another trend we see is a string of Indian film Directors who have shot to fame owing to Bollywood. Anand Mapsukar (director of Newton, India's Oscar nomination), Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari (Filmfare winner for best Director for Bareilly ki Barfi) Amit Sharma (Badhaai Ho), Amit Tiwari, Abhinay Deo, Vikramaditya Motwane and many such names are the toast of the ad world. An ad film turned feature film Director shares an opinion, ""Most of the celebrities are more comfortable working on an ad film with us as they are sure of the final outcome since it is handled by a pro"".

While the ad film is a good source of income for these directors in their 'fallow period', the added allure of feature films increases their equity and they are sought out by clients and agencies. Their storytelling techniques, characterisation and grip over the medium give them an edge over others. Feature film directors who have their films rooted in the middle class milieu and who create interesting, relatable middle-class characters, with their quirks and idiosyncrasies, are sought out to create similar characters for ad films.

Several agency heads have left top jobs and launched boutiques taking with them a client or two. With low operational costs, many clients see great value in what they offer. Content start-ups, on the other hand, began with OTT platforms and soon started offering a slurry of long commercials and short films woven around the brand story. This makes for great digital content to be consumed on the move for the fast-paced consumer.

A client at a leading FMCG, who recently asked us to provide him with the list of the best creative hotshops, had this to say, ""The creative agency, over a period of time, gets complacent and the outcome is stereotypical and clichéd. Young hotshops break the mould and bring in much-needed freshness."" Boutiques and content start-ups are nibbling close to 15-20 per cent share of projects at the cost of large creative agencies.

Cost Bundling

Another new trend is bundling up costs for multiple films across domains where brands are integrated according to common intersecting domains. Three TVC scripts, five digital films and two still-shoots thrown in, now constitute one project. While done purely to save costs, the jury is still out on whether these kinds of bargains affect creativity.

To sum up, what one is seeing is some sense is polarisation (of sorts) for the ad film industry. While there is opulence at one end, there is cost cognisance in equal measure at the other. However, one thing remains constant: our clients know filmmaking is an art, all they want to know is what is the 'right price for that art'."

A viral photo on social media claims that senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo fell at the feet of Congress President Rahul Gandhi soon after taking oath as a cabinet minister in the newly-formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh.

In the picture, Singh Deo is seen bending near Gandhi's feet as Manmohan Singh and other leaders look on.

The photo has gone viral on several Facebook pages related to the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, with the message ""48 साल का युवा 78 साल के बुजुर्ग को आशीर्वाद देते हुए""

The photo was also shared by several other pages like Post Card Fans, My Prime Minister Modi, Social Tamasha and I Support Modi Ji and BJP.

TRUE OR FALSE?

Well, the claim is false on two points. Firstly, he is not 78 years old, as claimed in the message accompanying the photo. Born in 1952, Singh Deo is currently 67 years old, as recorded in the affidavit filed by him for the state Assembly elections.

Secondly, while the photo certainly seems as though the senior leader was falling at the Congress scion's feet, it apparently was not so.

A senior journalist based out of Raipur, who incidentally was at the oath-talking ceremony, confirmed to The Quint that Singh Deo had not bent down to touch Gandhi's feet. In fact, the story is quite different.

""I was there when this particular incident happened, Singh Deo had bent down not to touch Gandhi's feet, but to pick up a piece of thread that had fallen off the bouquet that Manmohan Singh was carrying. He definitely did not fall at Gandhi's feet.""Senior journalist to The Quint

Rajasthan Patrika, too, carried the viral photo with a small caption explaining the incident.

The daily had also zoomed into the photo to show the piece of thread that had fallen near Gandhi's feet.

BHUPESH BAGHEL SWORN IN AS CM

The new cabinet in Chhattisgarh was sworn in on Monday, 17 December, with Bhupesh Bagehl taking the mantle as chief minister. Senior leaders Tamradhwaj Sahu and TS Singh Deo were sworn in as ministers.

The party has not appointed any deputy chief minister for the state.

The Congress won a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh, bagging 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with only 15 seats, and Mayawati-Ajit Jogi's JCC+ alliance managed to win in 7 constituencies.

But other top leaders of the Congress party were present at the dais in full strength, killing rumours of factionalism and unhappiness over the selection of chief ministers, within the Congress.

The manifesto of the party for the three states shared common promises of waiving off farm loans, providing unemployment allowances to youth, making the states safe for women - among others.

For the three chief ministers of the respective states, the road ahead is going to be bumpy, as they face significant challenges.

Promises to Keep

The Congress party has promised the moon to the electorate in the three states. Fufilling these in a time-bound manner will be challenging. Many people are criticizing the farm loan waiver / unemployment allowance to youth, saying that these are not long-term solutions but quick fixes. I agree, but everything is fair in love, war and politics. Even BJP used the same tricks to win elections in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.

Kamal Nath, within hours of taking oath, signed the order for the waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakhs, taken till 31 March 2018. BJP and some farmer associations have already started criticising the waiver, as it excludes loans taken recently.

Even Bhupesh Baghel announced a waiver of short term agriculture loans up to Rs 6,100 crores, in his first cabinet meeting. Estimates for farm loan waivers in the three states vary from Rs 1.5 lakh crores to 1.8 lakh crores. There will also be comparisons; while Chhattisgarh has come up with the exact number of beneficiaries and aggregate amount of waiver, MP hasn't made such a disclosure; Rajasthan is yet to decide on the matter.

All the three states are landlocked which has prohibited industrial growth, and in turn affected employment creation opportunities. Jobs cannot be created up in the air without industries setting up shop there. The Congress governments need to come up with innovative ideas to attract industries and give sops, which the budget of the states may not be in position to support.

Within three months, the party needs to deliver at least on some of the key promises. The chief ministers have to ensure modalities are completed and schemes rolled out before the MCC for Lok Sabha elections kick in.

Potential Impact of Farm Loan Waivers on State Finances

While Rajasthan has a debt of about 3 lakh crores, MP is reeling under a debt of 1.6 lakh crores. The Congress has inherited a relatively financially stable Chhattisgarh. The farm loan waiver amount in MP and Rajasthan could account for one-third to half of the state's total expenditure, putting pressure on fiscal deficit numbers.

The monthly stipend to 10 lakh youth in Chhattisgarh is going to cost another 3,000 crores. This, along with farm loan waivers, is likely to double the debt of the state.

The MSP scheme also poses a challenge, as the previous Raman Singh government failed to deliver the same promise. The chief ministers will have to come up with creative ideas to compensate for these expenses; any additional tax burden on the middle-class could eliminate the gains the party has made in urban seats in these three states. The Congress has won more than half of the urban seats in these elections (47/84).

Keeping Factionalism at Bay

Both in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, Congress has failed to secure even a simple majority on its own, falling marginally short. It had to depend on regional parties and independents for support. Even with their support, it will enjoy a wafer-thin majority; in MP it can go up to maximum 121 (+5 from the half-way mark).

While the BJP has refrained from adventures, especially in MP, the same cannot hold true forever. The BJP strategy might be to wait for the 2019 results and then strike.

The fact that the Congress has returned to power after 15 years in Chhattisgarh and MP raises expectations from leaders and cadre. The ministry formation is going to be a tough, with many aspirants. Managing expectations and keeping different factions happy will be the key test of Kamal Nath and Baghel. Congress will also face a strong opposition from 73 MLAs of BJP in Rajasthan where Congress had only 21 in the outgoing assembly, and from 109 MLAs of BJP in MP, where the Congress had only 58 MLAs in the outgoing assembly.

Keeping Up the Momentum till 2019

Lok Sabha elections will be held within 3-4 months now. These three states account for 65 Lok Sabha seats. BJP won 32 of these in 2013. A simple extrapolation of the results to Lok Sabha seats shows that BJP tally could reduce to half. Party could win 17 seats in MP, 1 in Chhattisgarh and 13 in Rajasthan. Since these states have bipolar contests, the natural beneficiary is going to be the Congress party. Its tally is likely to increase ten-fold from 3 currently to 34 as the states follow a trend of giving maximum seats in Lok Sabha to the party which wins in state elections.

Till the elections, all factions of the Congress party worked hard to ensure the party's victory, in the hope they could be chief minister. Now with names announced, it is possible Scindia in MP and Singh Deo, Sahu, Mahant camps in Chhattisgarh, may not work with the same zeal for the Lok Sabha elections.

The challenge for Rahul will be to keep them motivated and compensate with plum posts in the central governing bodies so that ever famous factionalism of party doesn't impact the prospects especially when it is in with a golden chance to defeat BJP in its own den.

Tussle With the Centre

We have seen how states with Opposition-led governments have accused the Centre of a bipartisan approach. Naidu of TDP walked out of NDA while ally Nitish Kumar's demand to accord special status for Bihar fell on the deaf ears of Modi and Shah. Shah has not even held a press conference on the electoral defeats showing how big a setback it is for the BJP.

There are talks already that Congress could approach the Centre for farm loan waivers that have been availed from nationalized banks. Both the state and central governments could blame each other for the failure on the part of the Congress to deliver on its promises. BJP could also now get a chance to blame Congress for its failure to implement central schemes in these three states.

To sum up, while the Congress has received a big boost by defeating the BJP in the three states, the magnitude of victory, tall promises and shorter time frame to deliver before the grand finale, complicates matters for the grand old party.

Retired detective Andrew Colborn has filed a lawsuit against Netflix and the directors of the hit true-crime documentary series Making A Murderer, alleging that they falsely portrayed him as having planted evidence to frame a murder suspect, Variety reported.

In the suit filed at the Manitowoc County Circuit Court in Wisconsin on Monday, Colborn alleged that the series has brought him ""worldwide ridicule, contempt and disdain"" since its 2015 debut. In a press release, Colborn's attorney Michael Griesbach said the show had ""severely and unjustly defamed"" his client as well as Manitowoc County, and that the lawsuit would set the record straight. Colborn retired from the Manitowoc County Sheriff's Office in March.

Written and directed by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, Making A Murderer was premiered on Netflix in December 2015. A second season came out this October. The series follows Manitowoc County resident Steven Avery who spent 18 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault and attempted murder. In 2007, four years after he was exonerated, Avery was convicted for the 2005 murder of 25-year-old Teresa Halbach and is currently in jail. His nephew, Brendan Dassey, was convicted as an accessory to Halbach's murder.

The show's first season examined the period from Avery's 1985 arrest to his release in 2003 and his return to prison. The series alleges gaps in the investigation and alludes to forced confessions and evidence tampering. The second season examines the impact of the convictions on Avery, Dassey and their families. Making a Murderer has won four Emmy awards, including Outstanding Documentary of Nonfiction Series.

The defendants in the Colborn's suit are Ricciardi, Demos, series editor Mary Manhardt and Netflix executives Lisa Nishimura and Adam Del Deo. The suit alleges that ""despite overwhelming evidence proving Avery and Dassey's guilt"", the defendants ""led viewers to the inescapable conclusion that plaintiff and others planted evidence to frame Avery for Halbach's murder"".

The suit also accuses them of selectively editing footage and omitting, distorting and falsifying the facts in order to portray Colborn as a ""corrupt police officer who planted evidence to frame an innocent man""."

In Jaipur, Ashok Gehot and Sachin Pilot were sworn-in as Chief Minister and Deputy CM, respectively, by Governor Kalyan Singh while Kamal Nath took oath in Bhopal in the shadow of protests against his alleged role in the anti-Sikh riots, in which his party colleague Sajjan Kumar was sentenced to life imprisonment on Monday.

Later in the evening, Bhupesh Baghel was sworn-in as Chhattisgarh CM in Raipur while senior leaders T S Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu were sworn-in as ministers by Governor Anandiben Patel.

The much-awaited decision on farm loan waiver promised by the Congress in Madhya Pradesh was taken within two hours of state Congress chief Kamal Nath being sworn-in as new chief minister.

In a bid to showcase opposition unity, Rahul was accompanied by leaders of many other opposition parties at all the three ceremonies.

In Bhopal, after the oath taking ceremony was over, Nath went straight to inaugurate the new state secretariat building and assumed charge. He subsequently chaired a meeting of top bureaucrats, where he signed files pertaining to four important decisions.

""The first file I signed on pertained to fulfilling our poll promise of waiving off loans up to Rs 2 lakh that have been taken by farmers of the state from the government and cooperative banks.

The decision will cover all short-term farm loans up to Rs 2 lakh taken from nationalised and cooperative banks.

""As 80% of agricultural loans are taken from government banks, I want to tell these banks that when they waive off loans of industrialists, they have no problem.

A day after pictures of the beaming trio holding hands with Mr. Gandhi were broadcast from Raipur, the jockeying for the meaty assignments has begun.

According to party officials, Mr. Deo had made it clear that having missed out on the top post, he should be given the Finance portfolio, which would enable him to influence key policies. The former Leader of the Opposition is considered the brain behind the party's manifesto, or Jan Ghoshna Patra, which promised a farm loan waiver and a minimum support price of ₹2,500 a quintal for paddy.

Mr. Sahu, who belongs to the dominant Sahu community, an OBC caste, could get either Agriculture or the Public Works portfolio, a party leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been seen by some as a favourite of the party's leaders in Delhi, lost out after Mr. Baghel, Mr. Deo and former Chattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Charan Das Mahant all opposed his candidature, party leaders said. A miffed Mr. Sahu had walked out of the meeting before being placated by the party leadership, the sources said. The idea of having Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu share the top job, with each occupying the post for two-and-a-half years, was also briefly considered before being dropped as many felt that it would send out a wrong message, especially after the Congress had won such a decisive mandate.

Within hours of taking the reins on Monday, the Congress government cleared a waiver of farm loans amounting to ₹6,100 crore which would help over 16 lakh farmers.

Year 2018 saw a whole host of changes in the retail banking and fintech space that affected consumers. The Supreme Court restricted the use of Aadhaar for e-KYC while the RBI banned cryptocurrency and announced a regime to make loan pricing more transparent. Here are the key highlights.

Retail loans to get transparent

Probably the biggest reform to benefit banking customers came towards the end of the year. In the last monetary policy that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced in early December, it said that all retail loans, including those given to small enterprises, will be benchmarked to an external rate. At the moment, home, auto and personal loans get benchmarked to an internal rate that banks fix (based on its marginal cost of funds) that includes a margin, which also your bank determines.

Effective April 2019, loans will now be benchmarked to an external rate. This will ensure that when interest rates in the economy go down, your loan rate will also move correspondingly. Besides, the margin (the spread over the benchmark) that your bank charges will remain fixed unless your credit habits have changed drastically.

This move will bring in more transparency; banks would be forced to reduce their loan rates in case interest rates move down, something that experts say wasn't happening.

Mini Nair, Executive Director & CEO, Essel Finance Home Loans said: ""This benefit can even be passed on to existing loan customers who would have a choice of shifting their loans to other banks in search for better rates. Even the new regime (post-April 2019) can give them better rates in their existing banks.""

Instant banking services halted due to e-KYC using Aadhaar stops

The Supreme Court order in September 2018 said it was not mandatory to link the Aadhaar number for opening a bank account.

Popular online opening mechanisms, such as through State Bank of India's (SBI) 'You Only Need One' (YONO) app and Kotak Bank's 811 stopped opening new accounts under the Aadhaar-based authentication system.

Further, in November 2018, National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) suspended the eNach facility that used Aadhaar to validate the customers. To be sure, eNach is a facility that enables banking customers to make or receive regular payments from or to their bank accounts, such as interest payments or systematic investment plans of mutual funds where they wish to invest in, every month. This also hit the digital lenders who used eNach facility to enable customers pay back their loans.

Ritesh Pai - Chief Digital Officer, Yes Bank, said: ""We expect costs of digital lenders to go up as they will now have to walk that extra mile to authenticate their customers.""

Experts believe this rise in costs will be passed on to the consumers. This has resulted in loan processing charges going up due to increased paperwork.

Ramaswamy Venkatachalam, Managing Director, India, FIS (company offering banking and payment solutions to banks): ""I expect that banks will come up with new ways to authenticate their customers completely online, like the eKYC process that earlier used Aadhaar. The use of live videos is one such example.""

The credit crisis

Loan disbursements took a hit this year on the back of the credit crisis caused by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services' (IL&FS) defaults. In September 2018, the firm along with its subsidiaries failed to repay their loans taken from mutual funds and other institutions.

There were fears that other non-banking financial firms, too, were in a sticky spot because banks reduced their funding to these NBFCs, further these NBFCs also tightened giving loans to customers.

Deo Shankar Tripathi, Managing Director & CEO, Aadhar Housing Finance said, ""While the liquidity position has been gradually improving now but concerns remain for smaller housing finance companies/non-banking financial company in 2019. Further, debt fundraising from capital markets may not come back soon to September 2018 level.""

Cards become more secure

Your debit and credit cards became more secure in 2018. The RBI asked all banks to replace magnetic-stripe-only cards with EMV chip-based cards by December 31, 2018. This is being done to reduce card duplication and fraud as chip-based cards are safer than those that come with magnetic strip.

Already, banks were issuing chip-based cards, but there were many customers who had magnetic cards as well. Navin Chandani, Chief Business Development Officer, BankBazaar explained, ""Present magnetic stripe cards could be swiped on a card skimming device and its contents are downloaded and fed into a counterfeit card, thus creating clones of the original card. These clones are then used to carry out fraudulent transactions.""

Jan Dhan Yojana Scheme gets a boost

Launched in August 2014, the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana enhanced its offerings in 2018. With effect from September 2018, the government increased the accidental Insurance cover available with every such account, Rs.2 lakh, up from Rs 1 lakh earlier. Existing overdraft limit was also increased to Rs.10,000, up from Rs.5,000 earlier. Further customers up to the age of 65 can now avail of the overdraft facility, up from the age of 60 earlier. Also, no paperwork will now be required for overdraft availed up to Rs.2,000.

Pradeep Agarwal, CEO of financial and wealth advisory firm Meri Punji said, ""This incentive will ensure that the benefits of the government schemes reach the beneficiaries with no intermediaries and also systemically regulate the flow of money into the economy.""

Some challenges in the PMJDY remain. ""In order to get accidental insurance cover, there should not be any restriction like the debit card must be used at least once. Further, the number of free withdrawals in a month must be raised to at least seven to eight. This is because the existing limit on four withdrawals also include bank transfers made through internet banking, and not just cash withdrawn from its automated teller machine,"" says Anil Rego, CEO and Founder, Right Horizons.

Ban on cryptocurrency

In April 2018, the RBI said it would bar all Indian banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges and related firms. The order came through in July.

Over the course of the year, the prices of bitcoin fell under $4000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) in November 2018 against a peak price of nearly $20,000.

The RBI's decision to clamp down on the volatile crypto currency came at the right time as it closed avenues for Indian investors to invest in it. However, those investors who had already invested are stuck in cryptocurrency do not have a way to liquidate.

Rachit Chawla, Founder and CEO, Finway expects bitcoin prices to continue to trade lower. ""Bitcoin doesn't have any earnings or value behind it, the reason for increase in price was just speculation in 2017. We don't see the price rising again.""

""Crypto investors should act rationally instead of emotionally because unexpected price drops can anytime make you cry,"" he added as a word of caution."

Political News, Nation, (Raipur), December 18:-Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has said his government will waive short-term agricultural loans of farmers and hike the MSP for paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal, fulfilling promises made by the Congress ahead of the state Assembly polls.

The state government will also set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the ""biggest Naxal attack in the country on political leaders"" in Jhiram valley, he said.

Soon after taking oath, Baghel Monday evening chaired his maiden cabinet meeting at the new secretariat office in Atal Nagar (Naya Raipur) where the decisions were taken.

The short-term crop loans to the tune of overRs 6,100 crore of more than 16.65 lakh farmers drawn from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Bank as on November 30, 2018, will be completely waived, Baghel told mediapersons at a press conference held late Monday evening at Samvad Bhawan.

He was accompanied by his two newly-inducted ministers - T S Singh Deo and Tamradhawaj Sahu - and Chief Secretary Ajay Singh.

The cabinet also decided to examine the short-term agriculture loans taken by farmers from notified commercial banks and accordingly, the loans of eligible farmers will be waived, the chief minister said.

The step of loan waiver would help in the uplift and economic and social empowerment of farmers, he said.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had promised that if elected, the party government in the state would waive loans of farmers and hike the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of paddy.

Baghel said within hours of his government's formation, these two promises were implemented.

On the MSP for paddy, he said it is being procured through primary cooperative societies at Rs 1,750 per quintal, a rate fixed by the central government. The remaining Rs 750 per quintal will be borne by the state government, he said.

If the amount of Rs 300 per quintal, which is currently being given as a bonus, is merged with it (Rs 750), only a burden of Rs 450 per quintal remains, he said.

""Therefore, the state government would bear the burden of Rs 750 per quintal and procure paddy at Rs 2,500 per quintal,"" he said.

He also said that a SIT will be formed to probe the Naxal attack on May 25, 2013 in Bastar district's Jhiram valley in which 29 people, including senior Congress leaders, were killed.

After the incident, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had conducted a probe and submitted its report to court.

But it did not cover the conspiracy angle into the incident, which had wiped out the state Congress leadership, he said.

Asked about his government's strategy to tackle Naxalism, Baghel said the government will hold talks with people and tribals who were most affected by it and then formulate a policy to deal with it.

""The previous government had tried to solve the problem through guns, which is not a proper way,"" he said.

""This is a socio-economic-political problem and should be dealt with accordingly. We would have to first talk to these people and take them into confidence and accordingly, draw a policy to tackle the menace,"" he said.

To a query on Congress' poll promise of complete liquor ban, Baghel said he is committed towards it but first he has to take the opinion of people from different communities and study the similar step taken by other states.

""The state also has scheduled areas where gram sabhas have to take decisions. We have to talk to various people and then study the bans imposed on liquor in other states following which the decision will be taken,"" he added.

The chief minister also said that issues raised by the media will be addressed effectively by his government.

He said corruption and irregularities will not be tolerated at any cost in the state, and asked government officials and employees to discharge their duties towards people with honesty."

Ashok Gehlot was the first one to the administered oath as Rajasthan Chief Minister by Governor Kalyan Singh at the historic Albert Hall in Jaipur while state party chief Sachin Pilot was appointed as his deputy.

However, the swearing-in of 72-year old Kamal Nath as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh was held in the shadow of protests over his alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots in which his party colleague Sajjan Kumar was convicted and given a lifer.

Nath has denied any role in the violence and the Nanavati Commission, which probed the 1984 riots, also gave him the benefit of doubt.

Before the ceremony, an all-religion prayer meet was also organised.

Immediately after taking over, Nath signed an order waiving loans of up to Rs two lakh of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, a poll promise by Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who had assured implementation of loan waiver within 10 days of coming to power.

In Chhatisgarh, Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was sworn in as the chief minister by Governor Anandiben Patel while MLAs T S Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu, who were among front-runners for the CM's post, were sworn in as ministers.

Gandhi along with former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and several senior Congress leaders attended all the three ceremonies.

Leaders of most of the opposition parties, including Nantionalist Congress Party (NCP), Telugu Desam Party (TDP), National Conference (NC), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Janata Dal (Secular) (JDS), Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) were present at these ceremonies, but heads of Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP) and Trinamool Congress were not there.

Gehlot's oath taking was attended by outgoing chief minister Vasundhara Raje and NCP's chief Sharad Pawar, TDP's supremo and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, NC president Farooq Abdullah and RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, JDS president and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, Karnataka Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha's (JMM's) Hemant Soren, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (JVM) leader Babulal Marandi among others.

DMK president M K Stalin, who had on Sunday proposed the name of Gandhi as the prime ministerial candidate of the proposed anti-BJP front, was also there at the ceremony.

Gehlot, 67, has become the fourth leader to hold the chief minister's post for a third time in Rajasthan. The Congress leader became the chief minister for the first time in 1998 and held the post again in 2008.

Pilot was wearing a 'safa' or a traditional turban as a mark of the Congress victory in the state. The state Congress president had pledged in 2014 to not wear the traditional headgear till his party returns to power.

Prior to the oath ceremony, Gehlot and Pilot along with other leaders welcomed Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and others at the Jaipur airport, from where they left to the Albert hall, an iconic structure located in the heart of the city.

The oath-taking ceremony of Baghel was attended by AICC general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge, Rajasthan CM Gehlot, Pilot, Puducherry CM V Narayansamy, MP Jyotiraditya Scindia, Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, Abdullah and Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, among others.

Baghel's predecessor Raman Singh was also present.

Who could better understand the dichotomy of long life than these fort walls of Gwalior! They have stood there for centuries, celebrating the glories and suffering the falls. They have witnessed many a love story blossom within their wombs, reverberated with the best of music, and cried at their helplessness in the times of torment.

Legend has it that they might have come into being as early as the third century when a sage by the name of Gwalipa cured a local king of leprosy. The time till the 10th century seems to be obscure in the recorded history but what followed thereafter were no less than page turners. After centuries of bids from various dynasties to take control, it was only at the end of the 14th century that Gwalior saw stability and with the rule of Man Singh Tomar the golden era arrived in 1486.

As you ascend on Gopachal hill nears the fort, the huge sculptures are bound to your draw attention. A long-drawn process in construction since the seventh century, most are dated to the 15th century and were later defaced and destroyed by Mughal emperor Babur who captured Gwalior from Ibrahim Lodi. The latter was the one to have spelt doom on the fort, which had cemented itself as the pioneer and patron of many arts.

The musical notes

Remember the Bharat Bhushan and Meena Kumari-starrer Baiju Bawra? Holding the distinction of being the oldest style of Indian classical music, Gwalior 'gharana' gave the world Baijnath Mishra, later Baiju Bawra, who could light oil lamps by singing the Deepak Raag. Man Singh's favourite queen -- Mrignayani was also his disciple. The Gurjari Palace is indeed a monument keeping that love story alive. After falling for the courageous village girl, Man Singh promised to fulfil her three wishes in order to marry her -- a constant water supply from the river Rai, agreement to be allowed to fight alongside the king in all battles and shunning the customary veil.

Around the same time, another student of Swami Haridas was establishing the prowess of the gharana in the Mughal courts. Born as Ramtanu, Tansen was not only one of the famous 'navratnas' (nine jewels) of Akbar's court but also an instrumentalist. Considered the most influential in north Indian classical music journey, he could not only make it rain with his singing (Malhaar Raag) but also calm down fierce animals. On one side of his tomb in the fort complex stands a tamarind tree. The tour guides never forget to mention that chewing its leaves would improve one's voice greatly. While there might be no way to check that, but Tansen's stature in Indian music is well confirmed every December when musicians and music lovers from around the world gather for Tansen Sangeet Samaroh at the tomb.

A study in contrast

The Jai Vilas in the heart of the city is a far cry from the structures and architecture in the Gwalior Fort complex. A 19th-century palace, it has European influence written all over it. A combination of various architectural styles, the Durbar Hall boasts of the largest pair of chandeliers in the world among many other outright opulent and awe-inspiring things. The silver train serving post-dinner indulgences is just one of them. Believed to be an attempt to replicate the palace of Versailles, France, a part of it continues to house the erstwhile royal Scindia family while the other has been turned into a museum displaying the finest of collectables, ranging from lavish to quirky to spectacular.

Not too far is Deo Bagh, which takes you back into the time once again. For, this is where some important meetings concerning the 1857 rebellion were also held. Nearby Phool Bagh is the tomb of Rani Lakshmibai where she breathed her last in 1858 fighting the British. Along with her, the other leaders like Tantia Tope, the Nawab of Banda and Rao Sahib had fled from Kalpi to Gwalior to join other Indian forces but as they failed to persuade other rebel forces in joining them to defend Gwalior, the British captured the city.

Earlier, when the Maratha army made its way to Delhi, the Jadhav clan took control of this place and made it into a summer house. While the 36-pillared pavilion is the pièce de résistance, the stunning Nau Bagh, and family temples and cenotaphs in Indo-Mughal architecture add to the sobriety of the whole setting. A part of the property being open for guests, dining inside its walls or among the historic gardens is like sharing a piece of history.

Walk down the lanes

The scrumptious affair with Gwalior then continues on its streets. Speckled with bits and pieces of history here and there, this place satiates the taste-buds of a food lover as effectively as it does to a traveller's enthusiasm. The early morning rush at poha centres gets justified at the very first bite and it does little but only add to the hunger, resulting in savouring light and fresh dhoklas and calorie-laden kachoris. And, as you head to the other part of the town to buy bags full of famed namkeens and gajaks, a train passing through the city completes the small-town picture. The only difference being the fact that this small town has a history huge enough to compete with the big ones."

After MP governor Anandiben Patel administered the oath to Kamal Nath, whom the late Indira Gandhi used to describe as her ""third son"", the new chief minister signed an order waiving loans of up to Rs 2 lakh of farmers in the state. During campaigning, Mr Gandhi had pledged implementation of the loan waiver within 10 days of coming to power.

The waiver is estimated to cost the state exchequer around Rs 56,000 crore.

Late evening, Chhattisgarh's new chief minister Bhupesh Baghel also announced that his government will waive short-term agricultural loans of farmers.

Short-term agriculture loans, taken by over 16.65 lakh farmers from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Banks as on November 30, 2018, will be completely waived, Mr Baghel said. The loans amount to over Rs 6,100 crore. The swearing-in ceremonies in all three states took place in the presence of senior Opposition leaders.

Mr Nath, nine-time Chhindwara MP, was sworn in as Madhya Pradesh's 18th chief minister in Bhopal on Monday afternoon, in the presence of a galaxy of leaders including Mr Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the chief ministers of two southern states and leaders of some regional parties.

In another major decision, Mr Nath ordered a hike in the incentives for beneficiaries under ""Kanyadan"" scheme of the state government from Rs 28,000 to Rs 51,000 each. Girls from below poverty line (BPL) families are given the incentive during their marriage under the scheme. ""I will implement each and every promise made in the election manifesto of my party,"" he said while addressing a press conference after taking office.

Mr Nath is expected to contest soon from an Assembly seat under his Lok Sabha constituency to enter the MP Assembly.

Mr Nath's swearing-in was held in the shadow of protests over his alleged role in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, in which his party colleague Sajjan Kumar was convicted and given a ""whole life"" sentence. Mr Nath has denied any role in the violence and the Nanavati Commission, that probed the 1984 riots, had also given him the benefit of the doubt.

District Election Officer Kathua, Rohit Khajuria, on Monday informed that Kathua district has got the distinction of becoming the first district of the state in establishing Electoral Literacy Clubs(ELCs), aimed at imparting electoral literacy to the youth.

According to an official, the DEO informed this while chairing a meeting held to generate awareness on Special Summary Revision (SSR) 2019 and launch of Electoral Literacy Clubs (ELCs) in the district.

ADC Basholi, ACD, CMO, CEO, SDMs of Bani and Hiranagar, Principals of Degree Colleges of Kathua, District Coordinator NYK, Principal ITI and Dy DEO were present in the meeting.

The DEO, while elaborating on salient features of the initiative, said that the entire project revolves around keeping voter education relevant and practical through a host of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular methods for the young (18-21 years) and future (14-17 years) voters. ""Election Commission of India is committed towards inclusion of electoral literacy through the medium of Electoral Literacy Clubs (ELCs) in educational institutions, organisations as well as in rural communities via Chunav Pathshalas,"" he added.

He directed the Chief Education Officer and Principals of various degree colleges of the district to sensitize students regarding addition, deletion, correction and transposition of names in voter lists. He also asked for providing data of students with disabilities studying in higher classes so that required facilities can be provided to them at polling centers.

DEO asked ACD to seek cooperation of newly elected Panchs and Sarpanchs in creating awareness on SSR with respect to 1st January 2019 as qualifying date.

To her, music is quantum mechanics. Waves of sur. Notes and the gaps between them. Her friends are ragas Bageshwari, Shudh Sarang and Malkauns. She sings Mazha Kondu Mathram with as much thairaav as she does Mehdi Hassan's Baat Karni Mujhe Mushkil with sincerity. ""This is a singer to watch out for,"" said jazzman Louis Banks at a concert last year. And veteran ghazal singers Pankaj Udhas and Talat Aziz are putting their money on Gayatri Asokan, who, at the recent Jashn-e-Rekhta in Delhi, presented songs from her debut album Ghazal Gaze, released at last year's Khazana festival in Mumbai.

Carnatic was readily accessible to Asokan, 41, at home in Thrissur. Born to doctor parents, she learnt music from her grandmother. Seeing her parrot songs from the Telugu musical Sankarabharanam (1980) at 2, her mother took her to late Carnatic singer Nedumangad Sasidharan Nair. College was about chorus singing and Western pop. But once exposed to Hindustani classical, she would go learn from Alka Deo Marulkar in Pune, Pandit Vinayak Torvi in Bengaluru, and now, in Mumbai, to Pandit Ajay Pohankar to hone thumris. It was a ""paradigm shift"", ""vilambit khayal isn't there in Carnatic music,"" says Asokan, whose alaaps and bandish made Malayalam film composer Raveendran give her her first break: Deena Dayalo Rama (Arayannangalude Veedu, 2000), a duet with Yesudas. Composers Ilaiyaraaja and AR Rahman collaborated with her later (she's sung in Tamil films, too).

""When I started playback singing, the queens were (KS) Chithra ji and (S) Janaki-amma (who had already retired), but there were no young voices,"" says Asokan, the recipient of the 2003 Kerala State Film Award (Enthe Nee Kanna) and the 2011 Amrita Fefka Film Award (Kinavile), among others.

Up north, ghazal from Kerala was synonymous with Hariharan. ""Kerala has a big following. They don't understand Urdu, but they love listening to Mehdi Hassan and Ghulam Ali,"" says Asokan, who has shared the stage with Hariharan on stage shows. Besides ghazals (whose nuances she also picked up from composer Taj Ahmad Khan, who would accompany Hassan on India gigs), Shubha Joshi, Shobha Gurtu's disciple, also taught her Hindustani classical, and Meera and Kabir bhajans, which Asokan sung at temples (Guruvayur, Tirupati) and Chennai sabhas.

""Unlike Hindustani gayaki, you can't have gamak-wala taan in ghazals,"" says Asokan, whose mellifluous voice while hosting the show Khayal on Malayalam channel MediaOne impressed Udhas. ""It's amazing that these girls from Kerala, Gayatri and Manjari, are interested in ghazals and want to learn the authentic classical ghazals, its ethos and tehzeeb,"" says Aziz, whose ghazals Phir Chhidi Raat and Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein graced 1980s Hindi cinema. ""It was a big deal to be recording artistes then,"" Aziz says, ""Music labels signed you, released your albums and LPs sold off the shelves."" ""With the loss of sales of CDs and cassettes, audio labels don't make money to invest in new talent,"" rues Udhas.

Asokan married sitarist Purbayan Chatterjee and moved to Mumbai (from Kerala) in 2016. The city gave Asokan opportunities to perform with the likes of Shankar Mahadevan (at Chatterjee's fusion concerts, ClassiCool). ""Malayalis are critical and hard to please,"" she says , ""But Mumbai is encouraging."" She laughs while saying that ""Not in my wildest dreams had I thought I would serve dal to Zakir (Hussain) bhai."" Hussain told her to sing ""without inhibition, with conviction. What differentiates an Ali Akbar Khan or Ravi Shankar from others is not what they played, but the conviction with which they played, unafraid of making a fool of themselves, making music in the moment."" Conviction shows in her ghazals. And with shows in Bahrain, Fort Kochi and Thrissur, December is chock-a-block."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

The Congress's dramatic comeback in the Hindi heartland of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan could mark the beginning of a new template of election management for the party, which it may try out in 2019.

The first sign of a departure from the ""traditional high command"" culture in these elections came when party president Rahul Gandhi used an internal app, Shakti, to get the feedback of ordinary workers in the three States on who should be the nominees for Chief Minister.

The Shakti app, devised by the data analytics wing of the party, connects the top leadership to the grassroots workers and has over four million registered workers. But that is not the only function of the data department.

The data analytics department, under Praveen Chakraborty, a former investment banker, does number crunching and helps create voter profiles for every constituency. This, in turn, helps the candidate prepare a ""constituency-specific campaign"" apart from the larger themes. In Rajasthan, for example, the party launched the ""Mera booth, Mera gaurav (my booth, my pride)"" campaign for every Congress worker to focus on booth-level management.

Though the party did not turn to Prashant Kishor for the Punjab election, after the media spotlight following his 2014 success with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, professional strategists are now a part of every election.

""In a tight election, election management certainly helps. Look at Rajasthan; while people were talking about a one-sided contest but eventually the BJP closed the gap substantially. This is election management,"" said Naresh Arora, director of Design Boxed, a company with headquarters in Surat that helped the Congress devise its campaign in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan.

Mr. Arora first started working for the Congress during the 2017 Punjab and Himachal Pradesh elections. ""In Chhattisgarh this year, we started our work almost nine months before the elections. We carried out ground surveys,"" he said.

The first task was to raise questions of the Raman Singh government in a way that people could relate to. So catchy slogans like ""15 saal, kayee sawaal"" (15 years of rule and several questions to answer) and ""Chhattisgarh ke 36 lakshya"" (Chhattisgarh's 36-point agenda) were launched.

Working closely with the chairman of the party's Chhattisgarh manifesto committee, T.S. Singh Deo, the party devised the concept of Jan Ghoshna Patra, or people's manifesto.

""We gave out a toll-free number, a WhatsApp number and SMS where people could record their suggestions and we received nearly 2 lakh suggestions,"" Mr. Arora said. To counter door-to-door campaigns by the RSS in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress launched its own Rachnatmak Lok Vistar Samiti (constructive panel for people's interests).

Former MP Sandeep Dikshit was tasked with reaching out to voluntary organisations since he ran an NGO in Madhya Pradesh before joining politics. He reached out to 700 organisations that work in the area of farmers' interests, forest rights, resettlement and land rights, Dalit groups and urban poor. Keen to repeat it for 2019, Mr. Dikshit has been appointed a secretary of the All India Congress Committee."

Gehlot, along with his deputy Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan, Kamal Nath in Madhya Pradesh and Baghel in Chhattisgarh were administered the oath of office and secrecy by the Governors in the presence of Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and a number of opposition leaders.

Riding on huge anti-incumbency against the Vasundhara Raje-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, the Congress with farm loan waiver as its major poll plank came to power in the state winning 99 of the 199 seats at stake.

In Bhopal, nine-time MP and former Union Minister Kamal Nath became Madhya Pradesh's 18th Chief Minister, on a day the Delhi High Court convicted Congress leader Sajjan Kumar in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, prompting attacks from the BJP which alleges Kamal Nath's involvement in the riots in the national capital.

With the BJP and ally Shiromani Akali Dal attacking the Congress for its choice in Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath responded to the charges alleging ""politics"" behind the attacks.

""I took oath in 1991 and several times after that, no one said anything. There is no case, FIR, or charge-sheet against me. Today they are raking up this matter. You can understand the politics behind this,"" said Kamal Nath.

Credited with steering the party to victory in the saffron stronghold, Kamal Nath, immediately after assuming power, cleared files for waiving loans of farmers to the tune of Rs 2 lakh each.

With this, the Congress which won won 114 seats in the 230-member House, delivered its pre-poll promise of cancelling farm loans within 10 days of coming to power.

In Raipur, state Congress President Bhupesh Baghel, credited for powering his party to a landslide victory, became the third Chief Minister of the tribal-dominated state

Baghel, who represents Patan Assembly constituency in Durg district, was administered the oath of office and secrecy in the presence of Gandhi, Manmohan Singh, former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah and a host of other top Congress leaders.

Besides Baghel, Ambikapur MLA T.S. Singh Deo and Durg Rural lawmaker Tamradhwaj Sahu took oath as ministers.

After the swearing-in ceremony, Gandhi took to Twitter to thank the people of the state and vowed to build a ""new Chhattisgarh"".

Baghel, had taken over the reins of party nearly a year-and-half after the top state leadership was wiped out in a Maoist attack in 2013, including the then state unit chief Nand Kumar Patel and party veteran Vidya Charan Shukla.

He led from front in scripting the rout of Raman Singh-led BJP which was in power for 15 years, enabling the Congress to win 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly.

With the 2019 Lok Sabha polls only months away, the Congress's victory in the three Hindi heartland states is being perceived as a big boost for the grand old party in taking on the Narendra Modi-Amit Shah led BJP.

Senior Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel was sworn in as the chief minister of Chhattisgargh on Monday. Governor Anandiben Patel also administered the oath to legislators TS Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu, who were among the front runners for the chief minister's post, at a ceremony in Raipur's Balbir Singh Juneja Indoor Stadium.

In an interview to the Hindustan Times, the chief minister said his first priority would be farm-loan waiver ""as our president Rahul Gandhi had promised in the campaign rallies"".

""Second will be to procure paddy crops on increased minimum support price as promised in our party's manifesto,"" he added. ""We will impose a ban on outsourcing in government jobs with proper planning to facilitate more job creations.""

The chief minister claimed his party would be able to deliver on these promises within 10 days. ""If any financial hurdle comes we will deal it and the promises will be fulfilled,"" he added.

Baghel said Maoist insurgency in the state is a politico-economic problem that cannot be eradicated by security forces. ""If we deal with it as a law and order problem, it can expand further,"" he added. ""We have to create trust among the tribals of Bastar. We have to talk to them.""

The chief minister said his predecessor Raman Singh lost the elections as he had failed to address the needs of farmers, peasants and workers. ""Massive corruption took place in his reign,"" Baghel added. ""All these things went against him and the people voted against the government.""

The Congress swept Chhattisgarh in the recently held Assembly elections, winning 68 out of 90 seats to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party, which had been in power for 15 years.

Baghel, during his campaigns had dismissed the charges as ""BJP's political vendetta"".

Along with Baghel, his challengers to the CM post -- TS Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu -- also took oath as Cabinet Ministers. The portfolios would be allocated later.

Profile of Bhupesh Baghel, the Congressman Who Replaces 15 Years of Raman Raj:

Baghel was born on August 23, 1961 in Durg, then part of undivided Madhya Pradesh, in a farmer's family. He joined the Congress in early 80s', when he was involved in student politics.

After his stint with the Indian Youth Congress and the Madhya Pradesh Youth Congress, Baghel made his electoral debut in 1993 -- winning the legislative seat of Patan. On his re-election from the constituency in 1998, he was appointed as a Minister for Public Grievance Department in the Digvijaya Singh-led Madhya Pradesh government.

In 2000, when Chhattisgarh was carved out as a separate state, Baghel held Revenue, Public Health Engineering and Relief Work in the first government of the state, led by the then Congress veteran Ajit Jogi.

In 2004, Baghel was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Durg parliamentary seat. In 2009, he was re-elected to the Lower House, this time from Raipur seat.

Baghel administered oath of office by Governor Anandiben Patel at the ceremony held at an indoor stadium in Raipur.

T S Singh Deo and Tamradhwaj Sahu, who were once the front-runners for the Chhattisgarh Chief Minister's post, were sworn in as ministers.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi was also present at Bhagel's swearing-in ceremony.

Bhupesh Baghel has proved himself a daring and courageous fighter by steering Congress to a landslide victory in Chhattisgarh braving all odds and adverse situations.

57-year-old Baghel took over the reign of the party in Chhattisgarh in January, 2013 when morale of the Congress cadres was at its lowest ebb following twin-tragedy it faced in form of massacre of 27 leaders of party being massacred in a Naxal ambush in Jheeram Ghati in Bastar district in the state barely six months ago and third successive defeat of the party in the assembly elections a month back.

The never-say-die Baghel, a post-graduate from Pt. Ravishankar Shukla University in Raipur, faced the challenges head-on after giving a war cry against his ex-party colleague Ajit Jogi and former chief minister and BJP strongman Raman Singh, who Congress had identified as bottlenecks in its return to power in the state.

Baghel was perhaps the only Congress leader who dared to take on Jogi, considered as the most powerful leader in the party in Chhattisgarh then because of his purported proximity to the party high command, and later ensured exit of Jogi and the latter's son Amit from the party. He ruthlessly curbed infighting in the party by showing supporters of Jogi the door.

Jogi later founded Janata Congress Chhattisgarh after breaking away from Congress in 2016 following Baghel's aggressive and courageous leadership.

He braved all kinds of threats while pressing for a CBI probe into the 2013 massacre of 27 Congress leaders in Jheeram Ghati by Naxals in Bastr district in Chhattisgarh as he suspected a political conspiracy in the gruesome incident.

Baghel had hit the streets from the word go to expose various omissions and commissions in the Raman Singh government in the last five years which triggered a strong anti-incumbency leading Congress to sweep the recently held assembly polls in the state.

Baghel had to spend a couple of days in jail in Raipur after CBI charge-sheeted him in an alleged fake sex-CD case involving a minister in the Raman Singh government.

Congress stormed to power in Chhattisgarh by securing 68 out of total 90 seats, forcing BJP to contend with only 15 seats."

Former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh and senior Congress leader Motilal Vora are also present at the ceremony. His colleagues Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot also took charge of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where the Congress dethroned the BJP the same day.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), in power in the state since 2003, was reduced to 15 seats.

Who is Bhupesh Baghel?

Hailing from the influential Kurmi (Other Backward Class) community, which accounts for around 14 per cent of the state population of around 2.5 crore, Baghel, 57, is known for his political acumen with strong leadership qualities.

He took over the reins of the party in October 2014, nearly a year-and-a-half after a Naxal attack in Sukma district in May, 2013, in which many of the party's senior leaders, including V C Shukla and then party chief Nand Kumar Patel, were killed. Shukla had succumbed to his injuries days after the attack.

Baghel led from the front to take on the BJP regime, led by Raman Singh, after being entrusted the task to revive the Congress' fortunes in Chhattisgarh following the third consecutive defeat in the 2013 Assembly polls.

Baghel had been vocal against BJP-led government's chief minister, Raman Singh, his family members and other ministers, unlike the previous years when most of the senior Congress leaders were seen going soft on the government.

Though, he was embroiled in many controversies, most recently in a sex-CD row purportedly featuring a state minister, he continued his fight against the BJP government."

The Dialogue, an emerging public-policy think-tank delivered a conference on AI, privacy and cross-border data flows and also released a working paper titled ""Intersection of Artificial Intelligence with Cross-Border Data Flow and Privacy"", at the Constitution Club of India.

The findings of the paper suggest that privacy can complement innovation in AI along with the fact that cross-border flow of data is imperative to drive AI growth in the future. Every day, large amounts of data flow course through the internet, over borders to power technologies that is leveraged for AI development and deployment. This data may originate from many sources located in multiple jurisdictions, making it imperative that data can move freely across borders. At the same time, with rising data collection and storage, doctrinal notions around 'consent' and 'privacy notices' should be considered. Privacy by design techniques can be incorporated at the level of privacy notices but also at each level of information flow till its storage and processing stage.

Founding Director of The Dialogue, Mr. Kazim Rizvi, stated, ""This paper addresses two key challenges - enabling cross-border data flows to drive AI and ensuring that high-level privacy standards are complied with for AI deployment. For India to emerge as a leader in AI, it is crucial to harness its potential while maintaining privacy of citizens, while at the same time, we must ensure that data is allowed to flow across borders to give our technologists, scientists, engineers and developers the best possible opportunity to leverage AI for India's development.""

The keynote address was given by Mr. Kalikesh Singh Deo, MP Lok Sabha and Dr. Neeta Verma, Director-General, National Informatics Centre, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, while Dr. Narendra Jadhav, MP Rajya Sabha gave the valedictory remarks.

Other officials from the government included Dr. Avik Sarkar, NITI Aayog and Mr. Atul Tripathi. The conference saw participation from industry that included Ms. Bishakha Bhattacharya, IBM; Mr. Venkatesh Krishnamoorthy, BSA Software Alliance; Ms. Anubhuti Bhrany, HP; as well as civil-society professionals such as Mr. Saikat Datta, Asia Times; Mr. Naman Aggarwal, Access Now; Mr. Apar Gupta, Internet Freedom; Mr. Amol Kulkarni, CUTS International; Mr. Rahul Sharma, IAPP; Ms. Gunja Kapoor from Pahle India Foundation; Mr. Adnan Ansari, 9.9 Insights; Ms. Anulekha Nandi, Digital Empowerment Foundation and Mr. Harsh Bajpai, The Dialogue.

The tech community saw participation from Dr. Gaurav Gandhi, Mlabs and Mr. Pranav, Analytics Vidhya.

Emphasizing that AI-driven strategies need to be developed by our country for social welfare, Dr. Neeta Verma, DG, NIC, Government of India said, ""An inclusive growth of our country is required. We can't let AI be just a privilege to the elite, it should include people from all spheres. Look at healthcare in India. There is a lack of access to healthcare and quality healthcare. The problem is not that these facilities are not available in remote areas, but it is that doctors don't want to go to such areas. AI can assist doctors - whether it's robotic heart surgery that we saw last week in Gujarat or early diabetic detection. Agriculture, Education and Smart Cities are some of the other areas vital to India's development.""

Mr. Deo added, ""Rather than a threat, AI can be an opportunity. The engineering graduates can develop new spheres using technology and Artificial Intelligence, which in turn can create new jobs.""

Dr. Narendra Jadhav, MP, Rajya Sabha in his remarks mentioned the importance of cross-border data flows and provided some key statistics. ""The cross-border data flows has increased 45 times between 2004 and 2014. In 2014 only, they accounted for US $2.8 trillion in GDP and hence, cross-border data flows are important for the development of Industry 4.0."" He further stated, ""Moving forward, trade agreements would hold the key to cross-border data flows. For data privacy and security, there needs to be a stakeholder consultation and anonymization of data must be done to protect citizen's identity.""

Also Read | Loan waiver Congress' priority; Kamal Nath to discuss matter immediately after taking over

Though the infighting between chief minister Ashok Gehlot and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot is avoided at least for the moment. Congress president Rahul Gandhi has been able to convince leaders of Chhattisgarh in CM's race including T S Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charan Das Mahant.

But the biggest challenge before Kamal Nath is that despite loosing the government in the state, popularity of former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan remains intact. Chouhan had already said that he would go to Kamal Nath to support good works of the Congress government. But if anything goes against the state, he will come out in protest even 10 days after the formation of the government.

Kamal Nath will have to walk a tight rope to manage leaders like Digvijaya Singh, Suresh Pachouri, Jyotiraditya Scindia, Ajay Singh, Arun Yadav and Mukesh Naik for very long time within the Congress. The way supporters of Scindia protested in Delhi on December 15 despite the fact that decision for the post of CM was taken tells that there is bumpy roads ahead for Kamal Nath. It also tells that the differences between both the leaders has not yet been resolved.

Supporters of Scindia are feeling cheated after Sachin Pilot was made chief minister of Rajasthan. They demanded post of party president for Scindia and good number of ministerial berth for his supporters. This is also not clear that how Kamal Nath will satisfy to leaders like Pachouri, Ajay Singh and Arun Yadav who had lost even their elections.

But the most interesting question is that how long support of Digvijaya Singh for Kamal Nath will continue? Sources said that if Congress leaders have supported Kamal Nath setting aside factionalism, Kamal Nath will try to generate employment in the state by bringing investment using his connections.

As far as selection of Bhupesh Baghel as Congress CM of Chhattisgarh is concerned, he is a fighter in the eyes of Rahul Gandhi. He is happy with the closure of chapter of Ajit Jogi in the state.

Reports state that of the 20 students affected, seven were vomiting continuously since they had the midday meal provided to them.

This prompted the school authorities to take the students to the Nagarkurnool District Hospital for treatment. Another student Rekha was shifted to Sri Venkata Sai (SVS) Hospital in Mahbubnagar for better treatment.

""The meal served to us was very bad. That is the reason they all fell ill,"" said the classmates of the affected students.

After securing stunning victory in the recently concluded assembly elections in Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, chief ministers of the key states will be sworn at different ceremonies in their respective states on Monday.

All necessary arrangements are being made for security, dais, seating and pandal at their respective venues in Jaipur, Bhopal, and Raipur.

Kamal Nath is scheduled to take oath at Bhopal's Lal Parade ground at 1.30 pm, while Ashok Gehlot would be sworn-in as the Chief Minister of Rajasthan at historic Albert Hall at 10 am. Chhattisgarh's chief minister-designate Bhupesh Baghel is scheduled to take oath at 4.30 pm.

Congress President Rahul Gandhi will be attending all the ceremonies. Besides Rahul Gandhi, a phalanx of opposition leaders including Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, DMK president MK Stalin, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati, Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav, and NCP president Sharad Pawar are expected to attend all the three oath-taking ceremonies.

In the recently-concluded Assembly elections, the results of which were declared on December 11, the Congress dealt a massive blow to the BJP by ousting its governments in the three 'Hindi heartland' states.

Congress party made an impressive comeback in Chhattisgarh after a long gap of 15 years, winning 68 out of the 90 seats in the legislative assembly. Baghel's name was chosen after several rounds of discussions between Rahul Gandhi and the all four CM aspirants-TS Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu, Bhupesh Baghel and Charan Das Mahant on Saturday.

Baghel, 57, is an OBC leader of Kurmi caste from Chhatisgarh's Durg. He had served as a transport minister in Digvijaya Singh's cabinet in MP and later in Ajit Jogi's Chhattisgarh cabinet in 2000.

Baghel, Congress' prominent OBC face in Chhattisgarh, contested from Patan constituency and defeated BJP's Motilal Sahu by a margin of 27,477 votes.

After losing in 2008, Baghel staged a comeback in 2013 and then rose to the position of PCC chief. He is largely credited with leading Congress to a thumping victory in the recently concluded State Assembly elections.

Madhya Pradesh saw a nail-biting fight, where the Congress managed to bag 114 seats out of a total of 230. The Congress then roped in seven seats, two from the BSP, one from Samajwadi Party and four Independents candidates, to form the government.

Kamal Nath is the senior most member of the Lok Sabha, having won nine elections and is expected to use his organisational experience to strengthen the party at the grassroots. Kamal Nath has been a Union Minister in different Congress-led governments and has also held organisational posts including being in-charge of Gujarat and Haryana in his nearly four decades of political career. A friend of the late Sanjay Gandhi, he was first elected to Lok Sabha in 1980. He was Minister of Environment and Forests as also Textiles Minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government. Kamal Nath was a key member of the two UPA governments and was Commerce and Industry Minister in 2004-09. In UPA-II, he held the portfolios of Road Transport and Highways, Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs. As India's Commerce minister, he championed the cause of developing countries at WTO ministerial meetings. And everyone admits that Kamal Nath is one of those politicians who has friends across the political spectrum.

On the other hand, Congress emerged as the single-largest party in Rajasthan by winning 99 seats, while BJP managed to get only 73 seats. The Bahujan Samaj Party won six seats, while CPI (M) won 2, Independents for 13 and other parties managed six seats.

Gehlot was given the charge of Gujarat just months ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state where the Congress did not win but nonetheless gave a stiff fight to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

This cost depends on market rates, among other factors. For instance, the recent liquidity crisis pushed the cost of borrowing by 1-1.50% with no change in market factors. External benchmarks like RBI repo rate, 91- or 182-day treasury bill or G-secs often do not move with the market. Hence, if interest rate is linked with benchmarks, it may result in unpredictable loss or gain to HFCs and irrationally higher or lower cost for borrowers. HFCs can overcome this problem by extending fixed rate loans with sufficient spread over external benchmarks but that will defeat the purpose of interest transmission to retail customers which happens with floating rates. The present system of MCLR for banks and internal benchmark for HFCs is much better as competitive environment ensures fairness.

-- Deo Shankar Tripathi, managing director & CEO, Aadhar Housing Finance

NBFCs will mimic bank loan rates

RBI's recent announcement to link bank floating rates to external benchmarks is in line with global best practices and would definitely lead to higher transparency in pricing loan products. Also, MCLRs are not very sensitive to policy rate changes. External benchmarks, especially repo rate, will address this problem.

If the new format makes policy transmission more efficient, the prompt changes in bank lending rates would automatically manifest through fluctuations in net interest margins of NBFCs and HFCs, and in a competitive environment the latter's lending rates would mimic that of banks. However, NBFCs and HFCs could also adopt such a framework, provided they are able to raise funds at rates linked to such external benchmarks.

-- Khushru Jijina, managing director, Piramal Capital & Housing Finance

Benchmark rules should be uniform

We are awaiting final guidelines from RBI on this matter. What we understand is that the rate needs to be linked to an external benchmark as specified by RBI and the spread over the benchmark rate (as decided by the bank) should remain unchanged through the life of the loan, unless the borrower's credit assessment undergoes a substantial change. In the short term, it may not impact rates much, but depending on how RBI recommends banks revise rates, it will impact how often rate changes are passed on to the customer.

HFCs and NBFCs are significant players in home loan and micro loans segments. It would be in the interest of the customer that regulation with regard to the benchmark rate and treatment be uniformly applied.

-- Rajiv Anand, executive director (retail banking), Axis Bank

Move will create level-playing field

RBI's proposal that banks link all new floating rate retail and MSME loans to external benchmarks is forward looking and will improve transparency. Once floating rates are linked to an external benchmark, borrowers will be aware of interest costs and won't have to rely on banks' internal confidential calculations.

Although it will be a new paradigm for NBFCs and HFCs, in the interest of transparency and unambiguity for consumers, external benchmarking should indeed be extended to NBFCs and HFCs. Such an extension will ensure a standardised and level-playing field across the full spectrum of the retail lending landscape.

RBI should do away with operational nightmares by prescribing unrestrained execution rules for all these loans. From a consumer perspective, an inconvenient consequence would be complicated and frequent reset of EMIs."

TOI had reported in its late editions on Sunday that Baghel was the front runner for the job. He is credited with leading the organisation during the last five years against BJP led by an entrenched three-term CM Raman Singh.

Amid claims of multiple leaders, Rahul Gandhi kept his focus on the primary consideration of Baghel's organisational stewardship, which, coupled with his experience as a minister in MP and Chhattisgarh, added to his profile as administrator.

2. Modi Slams Cong: No Quattrocchi Mama or Michel Uncle in Rafale Deal

In his first public remarks since the Supreme Court rejected judicial intervention in the Rafale deal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday targeted the Congress and said that the party is ""lying"" and is ""frustrated"" as there was no ""Quattrocchi mama"" or ""Christian Michel uncle"" in the NDA government's defence deals.

Addressing a rally in former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's Lok Sabha constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, just days after the BJP lost power to the Congress in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Modi questioned the Congress on why it did not strengthen the Air Force despite demands by the military after the Kargil war.

He said: ""Humare liye dal se bada desh hai...Inhe desh ki parwah nahi hai...Modi ko woh kisi bhi tarah ek daag laga dena chahte hain...Lekin uske liye desh ko taak pe kyon rakh diya gaya hai.

5. Army Versus Valley March

The army has vowed to foil a march called by the Hurriyat Conference to the force's Valley headquarters against the latest civilian killings in Kashmir as it braced for a showdown with separatist-backed protesters on Monday.

An army spokesperson said the force would thwart all such ""evil attempts of the terrorist-separatist-Pakistan nexus to pit the civilian population against security forces"".

Sunday's tough talk came a day after seven civilians died and dozens were injured in Sirnoo village in Pulwama, south Kashmir, when security forces fired on an unruly mob that had swarmed the streets to protest the death of three militants in a gunfight that broke out early in the morning. A soldier also died in the encounter.

A National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe has revealed that in the last three years over 40 terrorists were pushed by Pakistan into India through the international border in Jammu, and then transported deep into the Kashmir Valley to carry out targeted strikes, said multiple government, intelligence and security officials familiar with the matter.

NIA has drawn its conclusion about the number of infiltrators after interrogating half-a-dozen overground workers (OWGs) - a nomenclature used by the J&K police for civilians who help militants - linked to Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), who were arrested over the past year, the officials added.

Sources told TOI that the commerce and industry ministry is looking at ways to strengthen the e-commerce sector while safeguarding the interests of domestic retailers.

Many of them are complaining about serious loss of business to ""adverse competition"" from e-tailers as well as the impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax.

Sources said the issue had been sorted out after Rahul tweeted a picture of all four standing next to him and smiling.

Sahu, the lone Lok Sabha Congress member from Durg and the chairman of the OBC department, was initially considered to be front-runner for the top post.

By Saturday evening, a compromise formula allowing rotating the top post between Baghel and Singh Deo for a term of two-and-a-half years each gained ground though party leaders remained tight-lipped over the issue.""Wait till Sunday,"" a party insider said referring to the meeting of newly elected lawmakers in the afternoon.

Sources said the AICC managers wanted an OBC leader to head the party government and Baghel, Sahu and Mahant all belong to this category. Singh Deo is an upper caste Thakur and a member of the former Royal family of Ambikapur.

Tip for Reading List | Climate change & extreme events

Advertising

At a meeting of American Geophysical Union last week, scientists reported their findings that 16 extreme weather events in 2017 would not have been possible without human-caused climate change. Among these extreme events were floods in Bangladesh, China and South America; a months-long heat wave in the Tasman Sea beginning in November 2017; and droughts in East Africa and some US states. One study, of wildfires in Australia, was inconclusive on whether climate change influenced the event. The findings were also published online in a series of studies in a special issue of the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society. These can be read online at http://www.ametsoc.org/index.cfm/ams/publications/bulletin-of-the-american-meteorological-society-bams/explaining-extreme-events-from-a-climate-perspective/.

The findings include:

Flooding: Extreme, 6-day pre-monsoon rainfall that inundated northeast Bangladesh was made up to 100% more likely by climate change. Climate change has made chances of the extreme rain that collapsed thousands of houses in southeastern China in June 2017 twice as likely. Peru's flooding rains of March 2017 were influenced by a natural cycle of warm coastal waters, but human-caused climate change on top of that made such extremes at least 1.5 times more likely.

Heat: Climate change has made the chances of heatwaves in the Euro-Mediterranean region that are at least as hot as 2017's three times more likely than they were in 1950. The chance of such a heatwave recurring is now 10% in any given year. Heatwaves like the record-breaking 2017 event in central and eastern China were once rare. They are now one-in-five-year events due to climate change.

Drought: Climate change made the 2017 Northern Great Plains drought 1.5 times more likely by shifting the balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration of soil moisture.

Ocean-driven events: Scientists found that the record sea surface temperatures in the Tasman Sea in 2017 and 2018 were virtually impossible without global warming. Extremely warm sea surface temperatures off the coast of Africa doubled the probability of 2017's East Africa drought. Record-low Arctic sea ice due to climate change influenced record-breaking precipitation deficits across a large part of western Europe in December 2016.

On December 12, the CLP had met in the state capital Raipur in the presence of AICC observer Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC-in-charge for Chhattisgarh, P L Punia.

It had passed a resolution authorising Gandhi to take a final call on the new chief minister.

""I was given the task by Rahul Gandhi to sweep the assembly polls with absolute majority. We saw the results, now I have been given the task to lead the state, I assure you that people of Chhattisgarh will never regret,"" he told India Today.

This sets the tone for the new government that will now be headed by Bhupesh Baghel.

It also remains to be seen how other veteran leaders like TS Singhdeo, Charan Das Mahant and Tamradhwaj Sahu are accommodated in the new government.

TS Singh Deo, often addressed as TS Baba, told India Today, ""Together we'll work for the people of Chhattisgarh.""

""Portfolios for the cabinet are yet to be decided but I have always been good with finance so that would be my first choice,"" Singh Deo said.

On the other hand, Tamradhwaj Sahu, who according to sources was the Congress central leadership's top choice for the post of CM told India Today, ""I was never the choice for the CM's post. Bhupesh Baghel is our unanimous choice and I am very happy with that.""

Even as the deputy chief minister's post still remains vacant, Bhupesh Baghel will take oath as the chief minister of Chhattisgarh on Monday in the presence of the party's top brass including Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh.

Whether the party will be able to capitalise on the wave in their favour with Bhupesh Baghel at the helm of affairs in Chhattisgarh remains to be seen.

After stunning victory of Congress in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, chief ministers of the three key states will be sworn in at different ceremonies in their respective states on Monday. In Chhattisgarh, the Congress party made an impressive comeback after a long gap of 15 years by winning 68 seats in the 90 seat assembly, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was relegated to a distant second spot, winning just 15 seats. BSP and Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh won in two and five constituencies each. BJP's ambition to claim victory in Rajasthan suffered a major setback when Congress emerged as the single-largest party by winning 99 seats while BJP managed to get only 73 seats. The Bahujan Samaj Party won six seats, while CPI (M) won 2, Independents for 13 and other parties managed six seats. In Madhya Pradesh, Congress got 114 seats in the 230-seat Madhya Pradesh Assembly, along with support from Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Akhilesh Yadav's Samajwadi Party paving the way for returning to power in the central state after a gap of nearly 15 years.

Congress President Rahul Gandhi will attend all the three swearing-in ceremonies on Monday. It is expected that the opposition will throw up a picture of ""opposition unity"" with the presence of various leaders. Some of the top leaders likely to attend the three ceremonies are Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, Aam Aadmi Party's Sanjay Singh, Janata Dal (Secular) chief and former prime minister H D Deve Gowda, Loktantrik Janata Dal leader Sharad Yadav, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah.

Senior Congress leader and state party chief Bhupesh Baghel will be the new chief minister of Chhattisgarh. The decision was taken at the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) meeting held on Sunday. Only Baghel will take oath as the chief minister at 5 pm on Monday. Baghel's name was chosen after several rounds of discussion with the four aspirants for the post -- TS Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu, Bhupesh Baghel and Charan Das Mahant -- at his Tughlaq Lane residence in New Delhi on Saturday.

Baghel is a powerful leader of the OBC community which makes up 52 per cent of the state's 2.55 crore population. The five-time MLA was elected from Patan in Durg district. He was Revenue Minister in Ajit Jogi's first government in Chhattisgarh that was voted out in 2003. Baghel was also in the centre-stage of the ousted BJP government's attacks was recently jailed for some days in Raipur after being chargesheeted by the CBI for his alleged role in the circulation of a sleaze CD against a powerful BJP minister in Chhattisgarh. With the latest achievement, Baghel is being credited with leading the party from the front in the fight against the BJP and scripting the crushing defeat of the 15-year-old regime of Raman Singh.

Veteran Congress leader Kamal Nath will take oath as Madhya Pradesh chief minister on Monday. After hectic parleys held by Congress President Rahul Gandhi, Nath was named as the next chief minister of Madhya Pradesh on December 14. Several discussions took place to whether pick 'old guard' Kamal Nath or 'young captain' Jyotiraditya Scindia. Kamal Nath will take oath at Jamboori Maidan on Monday. Earlier, when Governor Anandiben Patel had handed a letter of appointment for the top post to Kamal Nath, it was decided to have the oath-taking ceremony at the Lal Parade Ground but the venue was changed a day later.

Kamal Nath has the reputation of a go-getter who ceased to be an industrialist when he plunged into politics as a Sanjay Gandhi loyalist. A former union Minister, Kamal Nath is the senior most member of the Lok Sabha, having won nine elections and is expected to use his organisational experience to strengthen the party at the grassroots. Kamal Nath has been a union Minister in different Congress-led governments and has also held organisational posts including being in-charge of Gujarat and Haryana in his nearly four decades of political career. A friend of the late Sanjay Gandhi, he was first elected to Lok Sabha in 1980. He was Minister of Environment and Forests as also Textiles Minister in the P.V. Narasimha Rao government. Kamal Nath was a key member of the two UPA governments and was Commerce and Industry Minister in 2004-09. In UPA-II, he held the portfolios of Road Transport and Highways, Urban Development and Parliamentary Affairs. As India's Commerce minister, he championed the cause of developing countries at WTO ministerial meetings. And everyone admits that Kamal Nath is one of those politicians who has friends across the political spectrum. For complete profile, click here

Senior Congress leader Ashok Gehlot will be sworn in as the next chief minister of Rajasthan, while Sachin Pilot will be the deputy CM. It is for the third time that the two-time chief minister Gehlot will take the reins of the state. The decision on his name was taken after a series of meetings with both Gehlot and Pilot. Rahul Gandhi even held discussions with sister Priyanka Vadra and mother Sonia Gandhi.

Born in 1951 in Jodhpur, Gehlot cut his teeth in politics as a student leader and headed the Rajasthan unit of the National Students Union of India (NSUI), the Congress student wing. Elected five times to the Lok Sabha from Jodhpur, he steadily acquired political stature under late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. He was a Minister under Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi and P.V. Narasimha Rao.

Known for his proximity to both Congress President Rahul Gandhi and UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, Gehlot has lately been the party's ""go-to"" man in important matters. Gehlot was given the charge of Gujarat just months ahead of the 2017 Assembly elections in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state where the Congress did not win but nonetheless gave a stiff fight to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). His long association with Rajasthan politics, including his two stints as the Chief Minister and as the former head of the party's state unit, will surely be of immense help to Gehlot who has represented the Sardarpura Assembly constituency in Jodhpur since 1999.

After four days of protracted deliberations and brainstorming, Congress president Rahul Gandhi finally took the decision on who the chief minister should be. The announcement was made in Raipur on Sunday afternoon.

Baghel's rise in state politics began almost five years ago, after the top leadership of the Chhattisgarh Congress was wiped out in a Maoist attack at Jhiram Ghati in Bastar on 25 May, 2013.

The Ajit Jogi-led Congress had lost to the BJP in the 2003 Assembly election. Thereafter, the party also lost the elections in 2008 and 2013, which weakened the organisation deeply.

Baghel's first challenge after taking over as Chhattisgarh Congress chief four years ago was to consolidate the faction-ridden party and strengthen it at the grassroots level. It was certainly a tough task, especially when the BJP had been wielding immense power at the Centre and in the state.

After the election results were announced on 11 December, Rahul sought a referendum through an app called 'Shakti' - a unique experiment of sorts in Chhattisgarh. Nearly two lakh party workers, including the newly-elected legislators, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate.

According to sources, Singh Deo was earlier ahead of Baghel in the race for the post of chief minister. However, after a meeting of the Congress' top leadership in Delhi, followed by a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party, the party zeroed in on Baghel's name.

Factors in favour of Baghel

Baghel, the 57-year-old MLA from Patan, was deputy leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. He belongs to the Kurmi caste, which is considered a backward one. He has served as a minister in both the Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. After he became president of Chhattisgarh Congress in October 2014, he toured the state on foot and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

Even when he was a minister in the Ajit Jogi government, he had been a strong critic of Jogi, and the two never got along well. After Jogi quit the Congress and became its most bitter critic, the party leadership wanted someone to take both Jogi and the ruling Raman Singh government head on. Baghel was believed to be the right choice.

Baghel is known for his aggressive style of leadership, which has also attracted criticism from a section of party workers. However, this warrior-like image helped him to take the party to victory. The Congress got a landslide victory by winning 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, while the BJP got only 15 seats.

Baghel had been in jail for 14 days on charges of circulating a ""sex CD"" involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government. The BJP claimed that the CD was a fabricated one. However, the issue boomeranged against the saffron party, as the jail term became a factor in favour of Baghel.

While Baghel has been a minister, he also has age on his side. He is younger than Singh Deo and another contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu.

""Baghel's strong anti-establishment image, and his agitations over agrarian issues and rural distress, acted in his favour. He has been vocal against the RSS-BJP combine and has exposed corruption in the Raman Singh government. With strong secular credentials, he led the Congress' fight against the BJP,"" Ruchir Garg, a former senior journalist who joined Chhattisgarh Congress before the polls, told Firstpost.

Garg added, ""As he has strong organisational skills, he consolidated the Congress in Chhattisgarh and acted against anti-party people.""

However, the role of TS Singh Deo in the Congress' performance cannot be undermined. The party's manifesto, considered unique among such documents presented by the party in other states, played a pivotal role in the party's landslide victory.

Singh Deo, 66, popularly known as 'TS Baba"" across the state, was the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, and represents Ambikapur.

According to party sources, Rahul hailed the manifesto as a unique experiment and asked his research and analytics team to study and replicate it for the 2019 general election.

""Prior to the drafting of the manifesto, party leaders went to the masses and understood their hopes and aspirations, before coming out with a list of the ""doable"" promises in their manifesto. This ensured that no section of the society was left uncared for. It also ensured that the chances of the party defaulting on its promises were less,"" Chhattisgarh-based political commentator Parivesh Mishra said.

""Often, the drafting of a party manifesto is given low priority, and is done behind closed doors. Many promises are left unfulfilled. However, the Congress' Vachan Patra this time had short and long-term goals, with deadlines,"" he added.

The third contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu (69), the only Lok Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh, is known as Rahul's Man Friday. However, after the result of the survey of the ""Shakti"" app came out, his name was all but ruled out as a chief minsiterial candidate. According to political analysts, Sahu's candidature for the chief minister's post came up quite late.

Baghel, whose name was announced on Sunday, is the Congress president in Chhattisgarh. He beat back rivals including senior leader TS Singh Deo for the post.

The Congress is celebrating after a high-octane election in five states where it managed to leave the BJP behind in three important states of the Hindi heartland -- Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

Nath, who was heading the party's unit in Madhya Pradesh, had been seen as one of the frontrunners for the post of chief minister. Jyotiraditya Scindia, much younger than Nath at 47, was head of the campaign committee in Madhya Pradesh.

His colleagues Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot will also take charge of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan where the Congress dethroned the BJP the same day. Top opposition leaders are expected to attend the ceremonies in the state capitals.

In his first tweet since the announcement, Mr Baghel said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has given him the responsibility of building ""a new Chhattisgarh"" and he can assure the people of Chhattisgarh that ""the new Congress government would live up to their expectations and wishes"".

""We wish him the best as he forms a government of equality, transparency and integrity starting off with farm loan waiver for farmers as we promised,"" the Congress had tweeted.

""I am committed to waiving farmers' loans within 10 days,"" responded the five-time lawmaker from Patan.

The 57-year-old, who belongs to the influential Kurmi (Other Backward Class) community that accounts for around 14 per cent of the state population of around 2.5 crore, is a popular leader with strong leadership qualities.

Mr Baghel took control of the Chhattisgarh unit of the party in October 2014, about a year-and-a-half after several senior Congress leaders, including VC Shukla and then party chief Nand Kumar Patel, were killed in a Maoist attack in Sukma. He was given the responsibility to revive the party following the third consecutive defeat in the 2013 Assembly elections.

The infighting within the Congress was at its peak around this time with a group, led by former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi, extremely critical of others in the party. Even Mr Baghel and Ajit Jogi apparently had differences.

In 2015-16, after an audio tape allegedly revealed that the Antagarh Assembly seat bypoll in 2014 was fixed, Ajit Jogi's son, Amit Jogi, was expelled from the party. Later, Ajit Jogi, who was accused of acting as a 'B team' of former Chief Minister Raman Singh, also quit the Congress.

When the party was struggling in rough waters, Mr Baghel, along with TS Singh Deo - who was among the top contenders for the chief minister's post -- mobilised and motivated Congress workers. In the recently held state polls, the Congress won 68 seats out of the 90, while BJP was left with only 15.

Born on August 23, 1961, in a farmer family in Durg district, he made his debut as a lawmaker from Patan in 1993 in undivided Madhya Pradesh. He won in 1998 and 2003 as well from the same constituency. He was the transport minister in Digvijay Singh government in 1999. After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, he also served as the revenue minister in the Ajit Jogi government (2000-2003).

But in the 2008 Assembly polls, he was defeated by BJP's Vijay Baghel. A year later, he contested the 2009 Lok Sabha elections from Raipur and lost to BJP's Ramesh Bais.

Following successive defeats, both at personal and party level, it wasn't easy for Mr Baghel. But he tasted success in 2013, when he won from Patan, the seat that again voted for in 2018 assembly polls.

A few months ago, Mr Baghel was caught in controversy over a sex CD featuring a state minister. Arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation for allegedly distributing the CD, he was refused bail. Mr Baghel has denied the allegation, saying it was politically motivated. He was attacked by the BJP troughout the election campaign over the CD row.

The state's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had also registered a case against Mr Baghel and his family for alleged irregularities in a land-allotment case last year."

Now it's only fair the credit should also be his.(Keshav Singh/Hindustan Times)

It was an excited Pertie who rang early on Wednesday morning. ""You can't call him Pappu any longer!"", he bellowed down the line. ""With these elections he's found his political feet and come into his own."" I've rarely known Pertie to be so forceful about a political issue. Normally he's uninterested.

However, Pertie's pithy conclusion set me thinking. Was he right? After the results in the three Hindi heartland states has Rahul Gandhi's image changed? Has he established his political credibility with these successes? My brief answer is yes but let me explain.

Even though Congress was battered in Mizoram and embarrassed in Telangana, much of the credit for its revival in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan goes to Rahul Gandhi. Of course, he has to share it with others, like Kamal Nath and Jyotiraditya Scindia in Madhya Pradesh or Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot in Rajasthan or Bhupesh Baghel and T. S. Singh Deo in Chhattisgarh, but you can't deny the importance, if not centrality, of his own role. If Congress had lost he would have been blamed. Now it's only fair the credit should also be his.

Three things stand out about Rahul Gandhi's campaign. First, is his diligence. Since October he addressed 82 rallies in the five states holding elections. In contrast, Narendra Modi only held 31. He also held roadshows in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and public meetings in Mizoram. With these the earlier image of the amateur or dilettante, a part-time politician who was only visible when the sun was shining, has been nailed for good.

The second defining point of Rahul Gandhi's campaign was the severity of his attack on the prime minister and the BJP-led central government. Calling the chowkidar a chor was just the rhetoric and even if some found it distasteful you can't deny it stood out. But what struck a deeper chord was Rahul Gandhi's stress on demonetisation and GST, unemployment, rural distress and even, possibly, Rafale. These subjects found a ready and responsive audience.

It's the third element of Rahul Gandhi's campaign that suggests it would be facile to consider the outcome anti-BJP and not pro-Congress. His promise of wide-ranging farm loan waivers and, in Chhattisgarh, significant increases in MSPs would undoubtedly have encouraged millions of farmers to consciously vote for Congress. He was offering what they were seeking. To say this must have positively attracted their vote is, perhaps, to state the obvious. More than what they want, people vote for what they need.

However, what can we say about Rahul Gandhi's soft Hindutva temple visits? Did they redress lingering concerns that Congress was pro-Muslim and anti-Hindu? Did they diminish the hesitation many may have felt in voting Congress? Even if one cannot say for sure, these visits certainly did no harm to Congress prospects. Nor, it seems, did they put off minority voters. The soft Hindutva strategy is, therefore, here to stay.

Yet something else is also true. The BJP's and the Sangh Parivar's stress on immediately building the Ram Mandir clearly did not yield political dividends. It did not propel the Hindi heartland electorate to vote for the BJP. The truth is that a majority of Hindus would welcome a Ram Mandir but in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan they did not vote with this at the front of their mind. They were motivated by other material issues.

So, yes, Pertie is spot on. It's time to say 'bye-bye Pappu and hello Rahul Gandhi'."

Hailing from the influential Kurmi (Other Backward Class) community, which accounts for around 14 per cent of the state population of around 2.5 crore, Baghel, 57, is known for his political acumen with strong leadership qualities.

He took over the reins of the party in October 2014, nearly a year-and-a-half after a Naxal attack in Sukma district in May, 2013, in which many of the party's senior leaders, including V C Shukla and then party chief Nand Kumar Patel, were killed. Shukla had succumbed to his injuries days after the attack.

Baghel led from the front to take on the BJP regime, led by Raman Singh, after being entrusted the task to revive the Congress' fortunes in Chhattisgarh following the third consecutive defeat in the 2013 assembly polls.

At that time, the infighting within the Congress was at its peak with a group, led by former chief minister Ajit Jogi, having differences with several other party leaders. Even Baghel and Jogi were apparently not on cordial terms.

In 2015-16, after an audio tape purportedly revealed that the Antagarh assembly seat bypoll in 2014 was fixed, the state Congress unit expelled Ajit Jogi's son, Amit Jogi, from the party.

Later, Ajit Jogi, who was accused of acting as a 'B team' of Raman Singh, also quit the Congress.

Even at the time of ripples in the party, Baghel, along with then leader of oOpposition in the assembly TS Singh Deo, continued to play a key role in mobilising and motivating Congress workers, who were disappointed after the party having faced three defeats in the state.

Born on August 23, 1961, in a farmer's family in Durg district, his political career started in 1980s. He was first elected as an MLA from Patan seat in 1993 and then consecutively in 1998 and 2003 from the same constituency.

In the 2008 assembly polls, he suffered defeat at the hands of BJP's Vijay Baghel, following which he was given ticket from Raipur for the 2009 Lok Sabha election, which he also lost to the saffron party's Ramesh Bais.

But, he bounced back in the state in 2013 by winning from the Patan assembly seat and again emerging victorious from the same seat in the recently-concluded polls.

After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, he served as a revenue minister in the Ajit Jogi government (2000-2003).

Baghel had been vocal against BJP-led government's chief minister, Raman Singh, his family members and other ministers, unlike the previous years when most of the senior Congress leaders were seen going soft on the government.

Chhattisgarh Congress president Bhupesh Baghel, who has been named as the new chief minister, is credited with helping the party rise from the ashes of the deadly Naxal attack that wiped out the top party leadership of the state five years ago.

Hailing from the influential Kurmi (Other Backward Class) community, which accounts for around 14 per cent of the state population of around 2.5 crore, Baghel, 57, is known for his political acumen with strong leadership qualities.

He took over the reins of the party in October 2014, nearly a year-and-a-half after a Naxal attack in Sukma district in May, 2013, in which many of the party's senior leaders, including V C Shukla and then party chief Nand Kumar Patel, were killed. Shukla had succumbed to his injuries days after the attack.

Baghel led from the front to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party regime, led by Raman Singh, after being entrusted the task to revive the Congress' fortunes in Chhattisgarh following the third consecutive defeat in the 2013 assembly polls.

At that time, the infighting within the Congress was at its peak with a group, led by former chief minister Ajit Jogi, having differences with several other party leaders. Even Baghel and Jogi were apparently not on cordial terms.

In 2015-16, after an audio tape purportedly revealed that the Antagarh assembly seat bypoll in 2014 was fixed, the state Congress unit expelled Ajit Jogi's son, Amit Jogi, from the party.

Later, Ajit Jogi, who was accused of acting as a 'B team' of Raman Singh, also quit the Congress.

Even at the time of ripples in the party, Baghel, along with then Leader of Opposition in the assembly T S Singh Deo, continued to play a key role in mobilising and motivating Congress workers, who were disappointed after the party having faced three defeats in the state.

Born on August 23, 1961, in a farmer's family in Durg district, his political career started in 1980s.

He was first elected as an MLA from Patan seat in 1993 and then consecutively in 1998 and 2003 from the same constituency.

In the 2008 assembly polls, he suffered defeat at the hands of BJP's Vijay Baghel, following which he was given ticket from Raipur for the 2009 Lok Sabha election, which he also lost to the saffron party's Ramesh Bais.

But, he bounced back in the state in 2013 by winning from the Patan assembly seat and again emerging victorious from the same seat in the recently-concluded polls.

After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, he served as a revenue minister in the Ajit Jogi government (2000-2003).

Baghel had been vocal against BJP-led government's chief minister, Raman Singh, his family members and other ministers, unlike the previous years when most of the senior Congress leaders were seen going soft on the government.

Though, he was embroiled in many controversies, most recently in a sex-CD row purportedly featuring a state minister, he continued his fight against the BJP government.

The state's Economic Offences Wing had registered a case against Baghel and his family members for alleged irregularities in a land-allotment case last year.

In September, the Central Bureau of Investigation had filed a chargesheet in the special court in Raipur against Baghel, his close aide and journalist Vinod Verma and three others in a sex CD case.

He and other Congress leaders alleged that the action against him was politically-motivated.

Baghel was also targeted by senior BJP leaders throughout the election campaign over the CD row."

Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel was on Sunday decalred the new chief minister of state after days of intense deliberations with top party leadership headed by Rahul Gandhi. He will take oath on Monday.

The announcement was made by the Congress on its official Twitter handle even when the meeting of the Legislature Party was on in Raipur.

The party also announced that the new Congress government in the state would work on equality, transparency and integrity and its first task would be to declare a loan waiver for farmers of the state.

""Celebrations are in order in Chhattisgarh as Bhupesh Baghel is appointed CM. We wish him the best as he forms a government of equality, transparency and integrity starting off with loan waiver for farmers as we promised,"" the party tweeted, along with a picture of Baghel.

Top party leadership have had intense discussions over the past three days before deciding on Baghel as the chief minister.

The OBC leader, who steered the party to a stupendous victory with a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh pipped party colleagues T S Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charan Das Mahant for the top post, as Gandhi selected him to lead the state government.

Gandhi held several rounds of discussion since morning with the four aspirants for the post--T S Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu, Bhupesh Baghel and Charan Das Mahant--at his Tughlaq Lane residence.

The party sources said UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were also present at the Congress chief's residence.

Congress central observer Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC in-charge for party affairs in Chhattisgarh P L Punia were also present at the meeting.

Sources said the process of consultation on who will be the next chief minister of Chhattisgarh was marked by flip-flop throughout the day.

They said an official announcement in this regard is expected on Sunday and a possible swearing-in will take place on Monday.

Meanwhile, the Congress president tweeted a smiling picture of all the four aspirants for the Chhattisgarh CM's post along with a quote by Reid Hoffman.

""No matter how brilliant your mind or strategy, if you're playing a solo game, you'll always lose out to a team. - Reid Hoffman,"" he tweeted.

Party sources said the Congress was also toying with the idea of having a CM and a deputy CM, and also mulling division of the CM term to accommodate more leaders.

Congress had romped home to power in Chhattisgarh after 15 years with a two-third majority.

The Congress had on Friday named Ashok Gehlot Rajasthan's next chief minister after several rounds of discussions lasting more than two days. In Madhya Pradesh, Congress leader Kamal Nath was announced as chief minister-designate on December 13.

While Bhupesh Baghel was widely expected to be named the next chief minister. However, TS Singh Deo, who was the leader of the opposition in the last assembly and party's lone MP from Chhattisgarh, Tamradhwaj Sahu too had reportedly staked their claims for the top job in the state.

Reacting to his appointment, Baghel tweeted, ""Grateful to Rahul Gandhi. First he tasked me with securing majority for the party in the elections, now he has handed me the responsibility to build a new Chhattisgarh. I would like to assure the great people of Chhattisgarh that the government led by the Congress will fulfill the expectations and aspirations of common people.""

In the just-concluded elections, the Congress had won 68 out of 90 seats, while the BJP's tally was reduced to just 15."

Congress won in three out of the five states that went to polls, and ended the BJP's rule in Chhattisgarh. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.

Chhattisgarh Congress president Bhupesh Baghel, who has been named as the new chief minister, is credited with helping the party rise from the ashes of the deadly Naxal attack that wiped out the top party leadership of the state five years ago.

Hailing from the influential Kurmi (Other Backward Class) community, which accounts for around 14 per cent of the state population of around 2.5 crore, Baghel, 57, is known for his political acumen with strong leadership qualities.

He took over the reins of the party in October 2014, nearly a year-and-a-half after a Naxal attack in Sukma district in May, 2013, in which many of the party's senior leaders, including V C Shukla and then party chief Nand Kumar Patel, were killed. Shukla had succumbed to his injuries days after the attack.

Baghel led from the front to take on the BJP regime, led by Raman Singh, after being entrusted the task to revive the Congress' fortunes in Chhattisgarh following the third consecutive defeat in the 2013 Assembly polls.

Later, Ajit Jogi, who was accused of acting as a 'B team' of Raman Singh, also quit the Congress.

Even at the time of ripples in the party, Baghel, along with then Leader of Opposition in the Assembly T S Singh Deo, continued to play a key role in mobilising and motivating Congress workers, who were disappointed after the party having faced three defeats in the state.

Born on August 23, 1961, in a farmer's family in Durg district, his political career started in 1980s. He was first elected as an MLA from Patan seat in 1993 and then consecutively in 1998 and 2003 from the same constituency.

In the 2008 Assembly polls, he suffered defeat at the hands of BJP's Vijay Baghel, following which he was given ticket from Raipur for the 2009 Lok Sabha election, which he also lost to the saffron party's Ramesh Bais.

But, he bounced back in the state in 2013 by winning from the Patan Assembly seat and again emerging victorious from the same seat in the recently-concluded polls.

After the formation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, he served as a revenue minister in the Ajit Jogi government (2000-2003).

Baghel had been vocal against BJP-led government's chief minister, Raman Singh, his family members and other ministers, unlike the previous years when most of the senior Congress leaders were seen going soft on the government.

Though, he was embroiled in many controversies, most recently in a sex-CD row purportedly featuring a state minister, he continued his fight against the BJP government.

The state's Economic Offences Wing (EOW) had registered a case against Baghel and his family members for alleged irregularities in a land-allotment case last year.

In September, the CBI had filed a charge sheet in the special court here against Baghel, his close aide and journalist Vinod Verma and three others in a sex CD case.

Baghel refused to seek bail and remained in judicial custody for a couple of days, saying he will sit on a 'satyagraha' in the jail to protest against the government.

He and other Congress leaders alleged that the action against him was politically-motivated. Baghel was also targeted by senior BJP leaders throughout the election campaign over the CD row.

Congress on Sunday chose Bhupesh Baghel to be the new chief minister of Chhattisgarh from among four strong contenders, four days after the party came to power in the assembly elections.

The announcement was made at a meeting of legislators in Raipur, attended by Congress observer for the state, Mallikarjun Kharge and in-charge PL Punia.

Baghel, who was the state unit Congress chief, will be sworn in as the chief minister in a ceremony that is likely to be held on December 17, sources said.

The process to pick the Chhattisgarh CM took longer than the announcements in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan after the Congress's victories in the heartland states because of divided opinion within the state leadership of the party.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Saturday tweeted a picture of himself flanked by all the four claimants to the post -- Baghel, TS Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu, Baghel and Charan Das Mahant -- hinting at the end of tussle over who would be the next CM of Chhattisgarh after holding discussions with the leaders at his residence in Delhi.

""No matter how brilliant your mind or strategy, if you're playing a solo game, you'll always lose out to a team,"" he had said, quoting Reid Hoffman.

The Congress, which struggled to make electoral inroads since 2013, on Tuesday handed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) its biggest defeat in three crucial heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh, in a boost to the main opposition ahead of next year's general election.

Bhagel will be Chhattisgarh's third chief minister and the Congress's second CM in the state. He is a leader of the Kurmi community.

In a tweet, the Congress said celebrations are in order in Chhattisgarh as Bhupesh Baghel has been appointed as the new CM. ""We wish him the best as he forms a government of equality, transparency and integrity, starting off with farm loan waiver for farmers as we promised.""

The race within the Congress on who will be Chhattisgarh's chief minister was on ever since the party emerged victorious on December 11. Rahul Gandhi had the tough task of picking a name from four options-Bhupesh Baghel, TS Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charan Das Mahant.

All four had separately met Gandhi after the election results to present their candidature. Gandhi also held hectic parleys with Congress' central observer Mallikarjun Kharge and Congress in-charge for party affairs in Chhattisgarh PL Punia.

In the end, the Congress's central leadership chose Baghel's name over the other three contenders.

Outgoing Chief Minister Raman Singh's resignation was formalised on the day of the results itself, on 11 December.

An MLA from Patan, Baghel is also the state chief of the Congress party and is credited for bringing the party back to power after 15 years in oblivion. The Congress won 68 out of 90 assembly seats in Chhattisgarh to dethrone former BJP CM Raman Singh.

After the creation of Chhattisgarh in 2000, Baghel managed to retain his seat during the 2003 elections. He served as Deputy Leader of Opposition in Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly from 2003 to 2008.

He lost the patan legislative assembly seat in 2008 election. He was Indian National Congress candidate for Parliamentary elections in 2004 from Durg Lok Sabha seat and 2009 from Raipur but lost both the times.

He recaptured his traditional Patan legislative assembly seat in the 2013 election.

He is leading the state unit of Indian National Congress since October 2014. Baghel with the help of other leaders like T. S. Singh Deo, Charan Das Mahant, P. L. Punia etc. rejuvenated Chhattisgarh Congress after Jhiram ghati kand in 2013 left the party in tatters. He managed to sideline ex-Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and his son Amit Jogi in state congress after Antagarh Assembly by-election audio tape row.

Under his presidency, Chhattisgarh Congress won 2018 Chhattisgarh Vidhansabha election by a thumping majority. He himself became MLA from Patan assembly seat again."

Five days after the Congress party swept the Chhattisgarh polls, State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has been named as the next Chief Minister.

The formal announcement was made at Raipur at a meeting of the newly elected MLAs where he was elected leader of the Congress Legislature Party (CLP).

Though the Congress was spoilt for choices - ranging from former Leader of the Opposition TS Singh Deo to Congress OBC wing chief and Lok Sabha MP Tamradhwaj Sahu to former union minister Charan Das Mahant - Congress President Rahul Gandhi eventually picked the 57-year-old OBC leader.

""No matter how brilliant your mind or strategy, if you're playing a solo game, you'll always lose out to a team- Reid Hoffman,""Mr. Gandhi tweeted on Saturday quoting the LinkedIn co-founder and posted a photo of Congress Team Chhattisgarh.

Though both Mr. Singh Deo and Mr. Sahu were contenders for the top post, the Congress rewarded Mr. Baghel for steering the party through some very difficult times after a deadly Naxal attack in 2013 wiped out the entire Congress leadership in Chhattisgarh.

Mr. Baghel is also learnt to have impressed upon the central leadership not to buckle under pressure from Congress veteran Ajit Jogi that eventually led to his (Jogi's) exit. And, many believe, this paved the way for a more united Congress taking on the BJP.

All the three Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will take oath on Monday, one after another and each swearing in will be a show of Opposition unity as leaders from other parties have been invited to attend."

The announcement was made by senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge on Sunday afternoon.

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had on Friday held a round of discussions with Baghel as well as other contenders -- TS Singh Deo, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charan Das Mahant -- as the party was faced with a problem of plenty, as it did in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, where it went with the old guard in Kamal Nath and Ashok Gehlot, respectively.

Congress had ended the BJP's 15-year rule in Chhattisgarh in the recently concluded Assembly elections by winning 68 of the 90 seats, and Baghel as president of the state unit for the last five years was credited for the turnaround in party fortunes and had earned plaudits for the performance.

Baghel, known as a 'streetfighter' for his aggressive persona, had taken the BJP regime head on in the run-up to the election, a marked departure from its earlier ""soft"" persona in the state.

The former minister in Digvijaya's Singh cabinet in Madhya Pradesh had to rebuild the party in the state from scratch after a fatal Maoist attack in Darba of Bastar district wiped out the entire party leadership in 2013.

""The major issue that the Congress faced in the party was that because certain leaders, including Jogi had gone soft on Raman Singh, the party was projected as the 'B-team of BJP'. Under the leadership of Baghel, the party was able to change this. We fought a number of court cases on different issues and that was also important in changing the perception of people,"" said Baghel's aide on condition of anonymity.

Baghel, a patron of Chhattisgarh Manav Kurmi Samaj since 1993, represents the Kurmi community that has large representation in the state. He was also able to deftly capitalise on the exit of Ajit Jogi from the Congress a year ago as the Congress made up for losing Dalit votes by walking away with almost 8-10% of the BJP's Sahu-Kurmi and OBC votes.

Moreover, the Congress was able to capitalise on the ongoing agrarian distress in the state."

Congress president Rahul Gandhi held deliberations with the four leaders at his Tughlaq Lane residence in the national capital Saturday, they said, adding a legislature party meeting scheduled for Saturday has been postponed to Sunday.

On December 12, the Congress Legislature Party (CLP) had met here in the presence of AICC observer Mallikarjun Kharge and AICC-in-charge for Chhattisgarh, P L Punia. It had passed a resolution authorising Gandhi to take a final call on who would be the next chief minister.

Party functionaries said Gandhi had held the first round of meeting with Kharge and Punia on December 13.

Speaking on the selection of the new CM, state Congress general secretary Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said the decision would be taken after consultation with everyone, including contenders for the post.

""I want T S Singh Deo to become chief minister and we have expressed our feelings to Kharge ji. However, we will abide by any decision that the party high command takes,"" Samri MLA Chintamani Maharaj told PTI Saturday.

The MLA added that over 40 of the 68 newly-elected legislators wanted Deo as CM.

Meanwhile, Congress' Durg district general secretary Kaushal Chandrakar said Baghel should be made CM as he has worked to give a new lease of life to the party while it was out of power since 2003.

""The credit for the massive victory goes to Baghel and he should become CM,"" Chandrakar said.

The BJP, however, has questioned the delay in choosing a CM with BJP state general secretary Sachchidanand Upasane asking how the party intended to run the government when it was taking so much time to zero in on a chief minister.

In the two-phase polls that took place on November 12 and November 20, the Congress won 68 seats in the 90-member House and the BJP, in power since 2003, was reduced to 15 seats."

State Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, who is said to be a key player behind the party's impressive win in the assembly elections, is likely to be picked for the post, a person with knowledge of the matter said on Saturday.

Baghel returned to Raipur from Delhi on Sunday morning.

The swearing-in ceremony is likely to be held on Monday, said the person quoted above, asking not to be named.

The process to pick the Chhattisgarh CM took longer than those in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan because of divided opinion within the state leadership of the party, another leader said.

The party leadership had first zeroed in on Congress Working Committee member Tamradhwaj Sahu for the post, but the move was strongly resisted by both state chief Baghel and former legislature party leader TS Singh Deo, another strong contender for CM, the leader said on condition of anonymity.

Former Union minister Chandras Mahant was another key contender for the post.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had on Saturday tweeted a picture of himself flanked by all the four claimants to the post, hinting at the end of tussle over the chief ministership.

When asked whether he would be the CM, Singh Deo told ANI he would work for the state, but did not reveal any other details.

On the delay and BJP's criticism, he said, ""BJP which took more than seven to eight days to appoint its recent Chief Ministers should not comment on us.""

A party functionary, who was part of the deliberations, dismissed reports suggesting that the CM post will be rotated between Baghel and Singh Deo after two-and-a-half years. ""This happens in a coalition government and not within a party,"" he said on condition of anonymity.

The Congress, which struggled to make electoral inroads since 2013, on Tuesday handed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) its biggest defeat in three crucial heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh, in a boost to the main opposition ahead of next year's general election.

But it doesn't matter because they feel cold like we humans do. Our furry buddies have different coats - thicker than our skin. But it doesn't matter because they feel cold like we humans do. While buying warmers, make sure the clothing is not too tight, and have correct measurements. Use shoes to protect paws of our buddies and apply coconut oil daily before going to bed. This helps to keep the paws moisturised. Make sure you have proper bedding in place. The material should be of cotton or microfibre. Nylon or polyester can make your pet very uncomfortable, which can lead to itchiness or skin irritation.

Burns, Ouch!

Pet proof your home and secure your pet from any appliances/fireplace which can cause any kind of burn or injury. If staying in high altitude, one can use the room heater and place it out of reach from the furry buddies and children, so that they don't fall sick. Take special care of elderly pets and the young ones.

Water, quench the thirst

No matter which season, keep your pet hydrated. Make sure the furry buddies have access to clean water every time. Make sure the pet food and water bowl are washed twice a day.

Do not overfeed

Pets put on pounds this season. Shedding is a big challenge. Always feed them the right quantity. If your pet is a foodie, make 3-4 parts of food and feed it over the day.

Exercise

Make sure your pet exercises in the warmer part of the day. We also need to compensate for their less ourdoor time by indulging them with indoor activities or games like running up-down the stairs, hide and seek, fetch and throw, etc. This keeps them alert, active, and helps burn calories.

Daily grooming

Grooming on a daily basis is essential. Every pet has a different coat and needs different attention.

Short coat - Comb the pet at least twice daily. If there's a lot of hairfall, use a fine comb or furminator comb. Always brush the coat starting from tail to head.

Long coat - Comb your pet's fur twice a day. Use a tick and flea comb or a narrow comb. Use a hair serum to keep the coat soft and untangled.

Eye cleaning - Use rosewater on cotton ball to remove the dirt near the eyes.

Oral care - Use oral spray daily to control plaque and odour.

Paws - Wash the paws every time the pet returns from his walks. Apply coconut oil on paw-pads before bed. This will help keep the paw-pads moisturised, and prevent them from cracking and hardening.

Pampering

One can groom the pet at home or opt for a spa service. Proper grooming from a professional is a must at least once every alternate month. Nail clipping is imperative too, keep the nails short - there is high chance of getting nails chipped or getting curled into the skin if grown very long.

Use Epiotic solution on cotton ball to clean the ears. For dental hygiene, use the oral spray or denta paste. Trim the hair near anal sac and behind the paws using a pet trimmer. Long coat pets can have a shorter coat to prevent it from getting matted or tangled. But never opt for zero shave. Make sure you are using a mild pet shampoo and conditioner. Avoid any kind of fur whitening shampoos and chemical wash. Make sure you wash the pet thoroughly with plenty of water. If not washed properly, pets might feel itchy which can cause skin infection. Blow-dry the pet after the wash. Avoid using deodorants or deo powders within 24 hours of bathing. For ticks and flea, consult your vet.

Daily checklist

- See to it that all vaccinations are up to date.

- Deworm your pet every four months.

- Feed pets on time.

-Pet should always have access to clean water.

- Dress the pet in T-shirts or warm clothes.

- Keep medicine and unsafe things secured and out of reach.

-Comb the pets in opposite direction (tail to head).

-Wash paws after walk.

-Engage your pet in indoor activities for at least 20-30 mins.

-Have a first-aid kit at home for pet and a vet's number handy.

Nations Sunday struck a deal to breathe life into the landmark 2015 Paris climate treaty after marathon UN talks that failed to match the ambition the world's most vulnerable countries need to avert dangerous global warming.

Delegates from nearly 200 states finalised a common rule book designed to deliver the Paris goals of limiting global temperature rises to well below two degrees Celsius.

""Putting together the Paris agreement work programme is a big responsibility,"" said COP24 president Michal Kurtyka as he gavelled the deal after talks in Poland that ran deep into overtime.

France's 'yellow vest' protests lose momentum on decisive weekend

Groups of defiant ""yellow vest"" demonstrators faced off with tens of thousands of police around France on Saturday, but the protest movement appeared to have lost momentum on a fifth and decisive weekend. President Emmanuel Macron, facing the biggest crisis of his presidency, announced a series of concessions on Monday to defuse the explosive ""yellow vest"" crisis, which swelled up from rural and small-town France last month.

The package of tax and minimum wage measures for low-income workers, coupled with bitter winter weather this weekend, appeared to have helped bring calm to the country after more than a month of clashes and disruption.

France was also hit by a fresh deadly terror attack on Tuesday night when a gunman opened fire at a Christmas market in Strasbourg, leading the government to urge people to stay at home to spare the stretched security forces.

""It's a bit of a failure because the state is stopping us from being able to demonstrate properly,"" Marie, a 35-year-old domestic helper, told AFP in Paris after travelling her home around 50 kilometres south of the capital.

Brightest comet

Stargazers are in for a treat as the ""brightest comet"" is set to make one of the 10 closest comet flybys of Earth in 70 years, and one may even be able to see it without a telescope on 16 December.

The comet, known as 46P/Wirtanen, will approach at a distant 11.4 million kilometres or 30 lunar distances from Earth. Comet Wirtanen has already been visible in larger amateur telescopes, and while the brightness of comets is notoriously difficult to predict, there is the possibility that during its close approach comet Wirtanen could be visible with binoculars or to the naked eye.

First discovered by astronomer Carl Wirtanen in 1948, 46P/Wirtanen, with a width of 1.1 kilometres, orbits the Sun fairly quickly for a comet -- once every 5.4 years -- making it a short-period comet.

Indian-origin woman attacked on subway; accused charged with hate crime

A 54-year-old man has been charged with a hate crime for assaulting an Indian-origin woman travelling in a New York subway and using homophobic slurs against her. Allasheed Allah, 54, was brought before the court on Thursday and charged with assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment against Avneet Kaur, 20, for the attack in New York City's Queens borough last month.

According to the charges, Kaur was travelling on a subway train in Manhattan last month when Allasheed engaged her in a verbal dispute. He then began making homophobic slurs towards Kaur and her friend. As the two women began to walk away, he followed them and hit Kaur in the back of her head and then once on her chest, causing her to fall and strike her head and neck on a pole before hitting the floor. She was immediately transported to a local Queens hospital where she underwent treatment for a fractured spine.

According to the charges, Allasheed admitted that he used homophobic language against Kaur and threatened her, asking if she kissed her friend travelling with her on the subway. If convicted, Allasheed faces up to 15 years in prison, Queens district attorney Richard Brown said.
