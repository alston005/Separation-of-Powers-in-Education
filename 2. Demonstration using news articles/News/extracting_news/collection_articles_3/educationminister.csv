Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that education should be able to strengthen the values of the renaissance, humanity and secular ideals, calling on students to grow up as righteous people who can take in human culture transcending communal and casteist thoughts.

Inaugurating the second floor of the higher secondary block of the Chala Government Higher Secondary School here, and the State-wide launch of 'Relish', the project to improve the English language skill of secondary students, on Saturday, Mr. Vijayan said there was a time when a large section of people in the State had been denied the right to education based on their caste. That situation changed now. ""We won that right not because those who imposed the denial of education voluntarily withdrew it, but as a result of strong struggles."" The move from certain quarters to push people into old social conditions and the dark ages should be defeated, he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the State had reached the present condition by defeating casteist division and discrimination practised by the feudal system.

Students should understand facts and analyse subjects scientifically, he said, adding that the educational programmes being implemented in the State catered to that goal.

As a result of the education protection initiatives, the academic standard in government schools has been improved, he said.

Stressing the need to improve the standard of education in accordance with the changing times, Mr. Vijayan said that 'Relish English' is a research-oriented project implemented under the leadership of the NCERT.

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks.

""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years.

The government is not in favour of examination-centric education, and it aims to transform the education system from being teacher-centric to student-centric. It is also the objective of the education protection campaign, the Minister said.

He added that studies should be considered as a journey towards making discoveries, and that one does not gain much by learning things by heart. An A+ in life is more important than an A+ in examinations, and students, teachers, and parents should be sensitive to this significant aspect, Mr. Ravindranath said. He also called upon students to use their mother tongue as a tool to excel in life.

The Minister pointed out that parents and teachers should motivate students to excel in their own creative fields. Never should a student be discriminated against for not making the grade.

At the Goa University's 31st annual convocation ceremony, Javadekar said work on the report on higher education, authored by former Indian Space Research Organisation chief K Kasturitangan, was completed on Saturday and would be submitted to the government soon.

Javadekar also said a separate category would be created for smaller universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the HRD, to ensure that such institutions don't lose out to larger ones.

""The National Education Policy will include accessibility, affordability, equity, quality and accountability,"" Javadekar said. ""These will be its five pillars. Our committee, under Kasturirangan, met for the last time on Saturday. Members said work was over and that they would hand over the education policy to me any time now. This will give a new direction to our education system.""

After GU vice-chancellor Varun Sahni said in his speech that it would be better if NIRF considered not just absolute numbers but per capita data, so that smaller universities don't find themselves disadvantaged, Javadekar said, ""It is a good suggestion that smaller universities should have a different category under NIRF so that they are not compared to universities having 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh students. If we compare smaller universities, they will appear to not be performing on par. But if we assess them on per capita output, the picture will be different. I assure you that a different category will be made in the NIRF ranking for smaller universities. I want to announce it here.""

The minister said other organisations would also be involved in the National Assessment and Accreditation Council's accreditation of institutes, so that each institute could be ranked at least once in five years.

Union Minister for HRD Shri Prakash Javadekar has said that the government is committed to increase quality education in the country right from primary education to higher education.

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers.

We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

The Minister said that we are focusing on research and innovation to boost research culture in the country. The Ministry of HRD successfully conducted two Smart India Hackathon in 2017 and 2018 and started process for third installment of Smart India Hackathon- 2019, he said.

The Minister further said that to promote innovation culture in India we have started Innovation Cell in AICTE and more than 1000 colleges started Innovation Club in their campuses. The research and innovation culture will make education more relevant and reliable, he added.

Beside these steps to promote quality education in the country we have increased budget amount for the higher education through HEFA, the Minister added. He said that India is improving its ranking in world class institutions but we want to enter in top 100 club of best institutions, therefore we are trying to make 20 Institutes of Eminence in the country, 10 each in public and private category.>"

The minister said quality in technical education is an indication of the quality of society and country and its economic growth and the quality should be imparted in all aspects of a technical institute.

He called for a holistic approach to design the quality of an academic organisation.

Terming the workshop as important, Bangalore-based National Assessment & Accreditation Council (NAAC) advisor Dr M S Shyamasundar said that NAAC reviews the institutional quality procedures on a regular basis in order to safeguard the quality of HEIs.

Out of the 56 higher education institutions in the state, only one university and seven colleges have been accredited by the NAAC.

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

On Wednesday, C Raveendranath, the education minister, visited her home in Cheppad in Alappuzha district and gifted her the laptop. An overjoyed Karthayayini Amma who was taken by surprise with the gift, impressed the minister by typing her own name in English on the laptop.

Sources close to the minister said he visited her house when he was in the area to take part in an official engagement. When someone told him that the nonagenarian wanted a computer, he visited a shop nearby and bought a Dell laptop worth Rs 25000 and gifted it to her in an official capacity. Public education director KV Mohan kumar accompanied the minister.

Karthyayini Amma, who never went to school in her life and raised her family by working as a sweeper and domestic help, lives with her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren at a humble home in Cheppad. She enrolled herself for the literacy exam earlier this year and spent months preparing for the exam in August with the help of a teacher. She told the Indian Express last month that she was happy she scored 98%, but also a bit sad to lose out on two marks. She added she wanted to study as long as she was healthy."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

Supply of dollars comes from the export of goods and services and also by inflow of foreign investment, both FDI and portfolio investment. On the other hand, demand for dollar comes from import for goods and services and outflow of foreign investment.

It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits. Therefore, they don't have any obligation on transfer of money overnight. The government can impose a minimum 'lock-in-period' on the investments made by these FIIs, to keep them invested in India. In some countries tax is imposed on conversion of currency by FIIs, which is known as 'Tobin Tax'. This may also discourage the outflow of investment by FIIs.

In such a situation demand for dollars increase overnight and in view of generally low supply of dollars rupee depreciates. A small scarcity of dollars causes a big fall in value of rupee. However, if we see, India doesn't have any deficiency of dollars per se. Today India is sitting at huge stock of foreign exchange reserves to the tune of more than 400 billion US dollars.

Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and MoS, HRD Dr Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought.

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today.

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of 'global citizen' or 'global village.' He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should ""Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate"", he added. He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE - Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure. He mentioned the steps taken for higher education.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living.

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given ""Brand India"" a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar lauded the vision and mission of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in providing holistic development in education sector with a stress on research and innovation. Shri Javadekar said that without innovation a nation cannot achieve sustainable growth, so the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives like IMPRINT, Smart India Hackathon (SIH), GIAN, SWAYAM and National Digital Library (NDL) to change the structure of the entire education system in this direction. The minister said that high technology research labs are being developed to promote brain gain as innovation in higher education is a key focus to support research within the country. He also informed that the budget allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore for Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) will also help to step up investment in research and related infrastructure. Government is promoting quality education in identified aspirational districts through RUSA, he added.

Shri Javadekar said that to ensure quality education, the ministry has developed learning outcomes, which will fix accountability on education providers. He also informed that for the overall development of students government has started ' Samagra Siksha' in which government is providing financial assistance to all government schools for library and sports and extended hostel facility for Katurba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya. The Union Minister congratulated all organizers for organizing the conference.

The Conference inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will have several sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

While chairing the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions.

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry's officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard.

In the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government's ""Empowerment without Appeasement"" policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to ""3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment"". In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet""."

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death.

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

On Saturday, School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan, announced that separate mark sheets each for 600 marks will be issued for Classes 11 and 12. He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

""In government schools, we always give equal importance to both Class 11 and 12. But, private schools rush through the first year, give importance to Class 12 exams and score better and make it to the better colleges,"" said KPO Suresh, president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers' Association, adding that this may even lead to students migrating to private schools.

""Students who go to private schools have better exposure and can get privately coached for competitive exams. School is the only exposure for government school students. When Class 11 public exam's importance is reduced, students will not have incentive to study well,"" he said.

However, teachers from private schools welcomed the decision. ""Simply knowing that their higher education will depend on only 600 marks and not 1,200 marks will reduce a lot of stress on them,"" said A Mayavan, a history teacher."

We, the Scholars/researchers/academicians from Nagaland working and pursuing studies from various universities across the country, are writing to you to express our deep concern and thereby draw your kind attention with regard to the failure to advertise the newly created post of 68 Assistant professors and Librarian in the recently advertised Common Education Services Examination 2018 by the Nagaland Public Service Commision. As you are well aware that the state cabinet has approved the creation of 110 Assistant Professors posts to be recruited within the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 vide the Office Memorandum No. CAB 2/ 2013, Sl. No 5, dated 4th of July 2018. The office memorandum clearly mentions that 68 of the 110 posts were to be created within the year 2018-2019 and the remaining 42 within 2019-2020.

Accordingly, the honourable Governor of Nagaland has given his consent by approving the recruitment of the 68 posts on the 9th of August, 2018, through the notification No. HE/ESTT/2-6/207. It may be humbly mentioned that both documents- the notification and the office memorandum of the state cabinet- were widely circulated in social media.

As such, the decision of the State Cabinet to create a sizable number of Assistant Professor posts for the year 2018-19 has been a positive departure from the existing trends.

Hence, this noble decision taken under your able leadership is a testimony of you giving due importance to meritocracy and bettering the quality of higher Education in the state; your decision has also been widely commended and welcomed by the academic fraternity. In view of this, all NET/PhD qualified, assistant professor aspirants have been waiting in great anticipation for the announcement of the said posts by the NPSC. However, much to our disappointment, when the Nagaland

Public Service Commission advertised the Common Education Service Examination, 2018, for various posts of Assistant Professor and Post Graduate Teacher, the 68 posts meant to be recruited within 2018-2019 were not included. On enquiry, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has responded that it is yet to requisition the 68 posts to the Nagaland Public Service Commission. With the last date of applications, as advertised, fixed on the 21st of September, 2018,

apprehension has risen among the academic fraternity with regard to the fate of the 68 posts of Assistant Professors and librarian, which are clearly earmarked for the year 2018-19; and whether the exams can be conducted along with the recently advertised posts.

Therefore, in light of the above, we appeal to your esteemed office to kindly restore our faith and requisition the 68 posts (without any reservation of posts for regularisation for those appointed through backdoor) to the NPSC at the earliest for advertisement and ensure that the exams for the mentioned posts be conducted along with the recently advertised Common Education Service Examination, 2018.

It is felt that your timely intervention will go a long way in once again instilling faith among the thousands of young Naga aspirants in the recruitment system, in meritocracy and right to equal opportunity. It is also felt that your sagacity will be instrumental in giving hope to the future generation and in imparting better quality education.

The academic fraternity look forward to your positive response on this crucial matter of education."

It was the first ever meeting of Education Ministers in the history of G-20.

While speaking on the inaugural day in Educational Ministerial meeting, Dr Satya Pal Singh, appreciated and thanked Argentina for hosting an exclusive meeting of Education Ministers for first time in the history of G20 Summit. He said that Education should be the first and foremost priority area for any society to develop and for any country to flourish. Therefore, it is most appropriate to place education at the center of global agenda.

Dr Singh said that India has been cradle of civilization and culture since ancient time. In modern time, India without forgetting its ancient wisdom has been making rapid strides in the field of education. He said that Prime Minister Modi has given immense importance to the education and therefore, India, under his initiative, has devised the strategy for its development which has core components of Accessibility, Equity, Quality, Affordability, Accountability, and Employability. He said that education should be 'Child Centric' and it should develop students holistically to make them a good human being first and global citizen later. To translate above philosophy in action, India is designing a new education policy.

He mentioned that India is one of the largest education systems in the world with over 1.53 million schools, 864 Universities and enrolment of about 300 million students. Despite hosting such a large education system, India still needs further expansion to improve accessibility. Dr Singh said in last 4 years enormous work has been done to achieve the same. He highlighted the several digital initiatives of Modi Government which include India's own MOOCs platform SWAYAM, which has been facilitating and encouraging a large number of students to learn anytime, anywhere. He said a special emphasis has been laid for teachers training by setting up National Resource Centres in 75 specific disciplines for delivering online refresher courses for 1.3 million faculty in higher education institutions.

Dr Singh apprised the gathering about the various initiatives of Innovation Index ranking of higher educational institutions, Smart India Hackathon in both software and hardware to find solutions for the problems faced by the Government, Industry and Academia by young undergraduate students, Atal Tinkering Labs in schools and Research Parks in higher education institutions to promote the design thinking and innovation, and joint research projects with international collaboration.

He said that we believe that education system should not only provide education but should also address the needs of the community directly. To achieve this, Government in India has launched 'Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan' under which higher education Institutions adopt nearby villages and help them by proving technological solutions to their problems.

Dr Singh said that India is a major economy in the World and we fully understand and realize our roles and responsibilities for furthering the cause of education and evolution of human being. He assured India's full support to the agenda of G20 Education Ministers meeting.

With active help of India, G20 Education Ministers' Declaration 2018 was finalized. [Copy attached]

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched 'Skill India mission' in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries.

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India's achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers' Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

He showcased the progress made by India in the field of education. He said that while India has a lot to offer, it also desires to learn from other countries to take its education sector to greater height. Dr Singh apprised them about recently launched initiatives of India for international collaboration. He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration). Education Ministers showed keen interests in all these schemes and assured India full cooperation. Italy, China, Japan, and USA also agreed to have an MoU with India. It was decided that further talks may be held to work out more details to develop roadmap for further collaboration. Dr Satya Pal Singh assured them that India will provide all support in their endeavor for bilateral collaboration.

The two meetings included Ministers of Education and Ministers for Labour and Employment from member countries as well as representatives of International Organizations like the World Bank, UNESCO."

After BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam told youngsters during a Dahi Handi event on Janamashtmi that he will abduct girls for them if they did not respond to their advances, the next BJP member to join the bandwagon is Madhya Pradesh's Education Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah.

Tawde also said the copies of holy books of other religions can also be given to colleges, provided they are made available for free.

Nowadays, even if anyone thinks of distributing the Gita in educational institutions, the move is seen as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system, he alleged, blaming the media for ""projecting it that way"".

""Today, distribution of the Bhagwad Gita means one is communal. When will we come out of this mentality? Even a Class 1 child can be taught several aspects of life through the Gita,"" Tawde said at the launch of Bhaktivedanta Vidyapitha Research Centre at Girgaum in south Mumbai.

The letter, however, did not mention which group or organisation gave the copies for distribution.

The move had kicked up a row with the opposition Congress calling it an effort to ""saffronise"" the education system.

""If anyone thinks of distributing Bhagwad Gita (in educational institutions), it is termed as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system by newspapers and television channels,"" Tawde said.

He said when Bhaktivedanta Trust of Bhiwandi in adjoining Thane district wanted to distribute the copies of the Gita in colleges, he informed them that the government itself cannot do so, but it could give a list of colleges to which the copies of the Gita could be provided.

Terming the Bhagwad Gita a ""non-religious"" text and ""a way of life"", Maharashtra Education Minister Vinod Tawde said on Saturday there is nothing communal in distributing the text in educational institutes.

Tawde also said the copies of holy books of other religions can also be given to colleges, provided they are made available for free.

Nowadays, even if anyone thinks of distributing the Gita in educational institutions, the move is seen as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system, he alleged, blaming the media for ""projecting it that way"".

""Today, distribution of the Bhagwad Gita means one is communal. When will we come out of this mentality? Even a Class 1 child can be taught several aspects of life through the Gita,"" Tawde said at the launch of Bhaktivedanta Vidyapitha Research Centre at Girgaum in south Mumbai.

""The Gita, Vedas and Upanishads are not religious texts, but philosophical and scientific in nature and these texts should not just be confined to temples, but be made available to common man as they are a way of life,"" he said.

""If copies of the Quran and the Bible are provided free of cost, they will also be distributed in colleges,"" the minister said.

In July this year, the office of the Joint Director, Higher Education for Mumbai region had issued a letter asking NAAC 'A' and 'A+' ranked colleges in the city to collect the copies of the Gita from its office. The letter, however, did not mention which group or organisation gave the copies for distribution.

The move had kicked up a row with the opposition Congress calling it an effort to ""saffronise"" the education system.

""If anyone thinks of distributing Bhagwad Gita (in educational institutions), it is termed as BJP's attempts of saffronising the education system by newspapers and television channels,"" Tawde said.

He said when Bhaktivedanta Trust of Bhiwandi in adjoining Thane district wanted to distribute the copies of the Gita in colleges, he informed them that the government itself cannot do so, but it could give a list of colleges to which the copies of the Gita could be provided.

""I asked the officials to help them (the Trust). But, the Gita bhakts (people of the Trust) themselves went to the colleges and distributed the copies,"" he said.

Tawde said the key question concerning the education system today is whether students were being imparted knowledge or just information was being passed on to them.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that education should be able to strengthen the values of the renaissance, humanity and secular ideals, calling on students to grow up as righteous people who can take in human culture transcending communal and casteist thoughts.

Inaugurating the second floor of the higher secondary block of the Chala Government Higher Secondary School here, and the State-wide launch of 'Relish', the project to improve the English language skill of secondary students, on Saturday, Mr. Vijayan said there was a time when a large section of people in the State had been denied the right to education based on their caste. That situation changed now. ""We won that right not because those who imposed the denial of education voluntarily withdrew it, but as a result of strong struggles."" The move from certain quarters to push people into old social conditions and the dark ages should be defeated, he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the State had reached the present condition by defeating casteist division and discrimination practised by the feudal system.

Students should understand facts and analyse subjects scientifically, he said, adding that the educational programmes being implemented in the State catered to that goal.

As a result of the education protection initiatives, the academic standard in government schools has been improved, he said.

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years.

The government is not in favour of examination-centric education, and it aims to transform the education system from being teacher-centric to student-centric. It is also the objective of the education protection campaign, the Minister said.

He added that studies should be considered as a journey towards making discoveries, and that one does not gain much by learning things by heart. An A+ in life is more important than an A+ in examinations, and students, teachers, and parents should be sensitive to this significant aspect, Mr. Ravindranath said.

At the Goa University's 31st annual convocation ceremony, Javadekar said work on the report on higher education, authored by former Indian Space Research Organisation chief K Kasturitangan, was completed on Saturday and would be submitted to the government soon.

Javadekar also said a separate category would be created for smaller universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the HRD, to ensure that such institutions don't lose out to larger ones.

""The National Education Policy will include accessibility, affordability, equity, quality and accountability,"" Javadekar said. ""These will be its five pillars. Our committee, under Kasturirangan, met for the last time on Saturday. Members said work was over and that they would hand over the education policy to me any time now. This will give a new direction to our education system.""

After GU vice-chancellor Varun Sahni said in his speech that it would be better if NIRF considered not just absolute numbers but per capita data, so that smaller universities don't find themselves disadvantaged, Javadekar said, ""It is a good suggestion that smaller universities should have a different category under NIRF so that they are not compared to universities having 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh students. If we compare smaller universities, they will appear to not be performing on par. But if we assess them on per capita output, the picture will be different. I assure you that a different category will be made in the NIRF ranking for smaller universities. I want to announce it here.""

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers.

We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

The Minister said that we are focusing on research and innovation to boost research culture in the country. The Ministry of HRD successfully conducted two Smart India Hackathon in 2017 and 2018 and started process for third installment of Smart India Hackathon- 2019, he said.

The Minister further said that to promote innovation culture in India we have started Innovation Cell in AICTE and more than 1000 colleges started Innovation Club in their campuses. The research and innovation culture will make education more relevant and reliable, he added.

Beside these steps to promote quality education in the country we have increased budget amount for the higher education through HEFA, the Minister added. He said that India is improving its ranking in world class institutions but we want to enter in top 100 club of best institutions, therefore we are trying to make 20 Institutes of Eminence in the country, 10 each in public and private category.>"

""Rings can be banned. They can go missing. Flowers, I am sure, would not be banned,"" he said, adding, ""anklets should be banned. The clinking sound can distract boys. It can affect their studies and concentration.""

A large number of students from two institutes -- Shibnath Shastri College and Heramba Chandra College -- took to streets on Thursday and Friday to protest against the Calcutta University (CU) mandate of 60 percent minimum attendance for appearing in examinations.

The agitators of Heramba Chandra College blocked thoroughfares in Golpark area for two consecutive days, demanding immediate relaxation of norms. The protest was also backed by students of Gurudas College and Jaipuria College, who demonstrated outside their campuses. The education minister said the government will not succumb to the pressure tactics of the students. ""Under no circumstances will the administration tolerate such pressure tactics. Many people were inconvenienced as they (students) blocked the roads to get their demands fulfilled. This is unacceptable,"" Chatterjee told reporters on Saturday.

Earlier this year, the CU authorities had asked all affiliated colleges to ensure that only those with a minimum 60 percent attendance would be allowed to sit for semester exams. A list of non-eligible students was recently published at Heramba Chandra College, triggering the agitation. Chatterjee pointed out that the state education department has fixed 60 percent attendance as a criterion to sit for semester exams, even as the UGC suggested 75 percent attendance for higher educational institutions.

""Maybe the agitating students wanted to sit for exams without attending classes or studying,"" he said. Heramba Chandra College Principal Nabanita Chakraborty, who met Chatterjee Saturday morning, said the authorities are planning to reduce the cut-off figure for attendance from 60 percent to 55 percent. Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), the students' wing of the ruling party, also appealed to the education minister to find a ""way out of the deadlock"" to restore normalcy in the institutes.

TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya, who met the minister at his residence, told reporters that the unit has sought a solution that would be acceptable to all sides. A TMCP source said the union urged Chatterjee to consider relaxation in attendance norm for this year.

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

""Currently, the draft permits only 80 students per class, which we feel needs to be extended to 100. We also demand the formation of a regulatory body - a coaching class council that will have representation of class owners and government"", said Bhuyar.

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits.

Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and MoS, HRD Dr Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought.

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today.

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of 'global citizen' or 'global village.' He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should ""Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate"", he added. He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE - Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure. He mentioned the steps taken for higher education.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living.

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given ""Brand India"" a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar lauded the vision and mission of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in providing holistic development in education sector with a stress on research and innovation. Shri Javadekar said that without innovation a nation cannot achieve sustainable growth, so the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives like IMPRINT, Smart India Hackathon (SIH), GIAN, SWAYAM and National Digital Library (NDL) to change the structure of the entire education system in this direction. The minister said that high technology research labs are being developed to promote brain gain as innovation in higher education is a key focus to support research within the country. He also informed that the budget allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore for Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) will also help to step up investment in research and related infrastructure. Government is promoting quality education in identified aspirational districts through RUSA, he added.

Shri Javadekar said that to ensure quality education, the ministry has developed learning outcomes, which will fix accountability on education providers. He also informed that for the overall development of students government has started ' Samagra Siksha' in which government is providing financial assistance to all government schools for library and sports and extended hostel facility for Katurba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya. The Union Minister congratulated all organizers for organizing the conference.

The Conference inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will have several sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

This Conference is in continuation of the efforts being made by the Ministry for evolving an action plan for transformation of the higher education sector. The first among this was held in Delhi during Vice-Chancellors' Conference from 26-28 July, 2018."

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

While chairing the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions.

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry's officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard.

In the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government's ""Empowerment without Appeasement"" policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to ""3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment"".

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

On Tuesday, Devegowda has written to the state government urging it to relieve a senior official from the department's planning section who had released Rs 108 crore in payments for various projects without informing the minister.

According to sources close to Devegowda, he recently met Revanna and sought a change of portfolio.

The minister said universities could directly conduct the examination of even semesters and the grade for the whole result of the course has to be decided based on this system. Jaleel also made it clear that the results for the final semester UG examinations should come before April 30 while the results for PG examinations should come before May 31.

Other major recommendations were to change the old pattern of examinations and to make the question papers and answer sheets available online. The valuation should begin immediately after the examinations. Jaleel made a point to the syndicate members on the recognition of certain courses between the universities in the state.

""Many students are struggling to get admission in a university if they transfer from other universities because of the grade is given to a course based on a university. So this should be prevented. For instance, some students who pass out from foreign and national universities are being told to produce equivalent course eligibility certificates,"" said Jaleel.

He also said that a State Assessment and Accreditation Council (SAAC) would be formulated soon to evaluate the performance of self-financing colleges. University syndicate members were also asked to make necessary changes in SAAC based on districts and areas. Jaleel also asked syndicates to avoid delay over the distribution of degree certificates to the students. He said the certificates should also be made available online and the research area should get proper attention.

""A research consortium should be formed. Centralised Instrumentation facility should be implemented. All necessary materials for the research programmes should be available at all universities. A proper co-ordination between universities is required for hassle-free research programmes. Each university should admit at least 100 foreign students in each academic year. The delay in scholarship distribution should be avoided. Our state should work as the centre of excellence,"" he said.

He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

We, the Scholars/researchers/academicians from Nagaland working and pursuing studies from various universities across the country, are writing to you to express our deep concern and thereby draw your kind attention with regard to the failure to advertise the newly created post of 68 Assistant professors and Librarian in the recently advertised Common Education Services Examination 2018 by the Nagaland Public Service Commision. As you are well aware that the state cabinet has approved the creation of 110 Assistant Professors posts to be recruited within the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 vide the Office Memorandum No. CAB 2/ 2013, Sl. No 5, dated 4th of July 2018. The office memorandum clearly mentions that 68 of the 110 posts were to be created within the year 2018-2019 and the remaining 42 within 2019-2020.

Accordingly, the honourable Governor of Nagaland has given his consent by approving the recruitment of the 68 posts on the 9th of August, 2018, through the notification No. HE/ESTT/2-6/207. It may be humbly mentioned that both documents- the notification and the office memorandum of the state cabinet- were widely circulated in social media.

As such, the decision of the State Cabinet to create a sizable number of Assistant Professor posts for the year 2018-19 has been a positive departure from the existing trends.

Hence, this noble decision taken under your able leadership is a testimony of you giving due importance to meritocracy and bettering the quality of higher Education in the state; your decision has also been widely commended and welcomed by the academic fraternity. In view of this, all NET/PhD qualified, assistant professor aspirants have been waiting in great anticipation for the announcement of the said posts by the NPSC. However, much to our disappointment, when the Nagaland

Public Service Commission advertised the Common Education Service Examination, 2018, for various posts of Assistant Professor and Post Graduate Teacher, the 68 posts meant to be recruited within 2018-2019 were not included. On enquiry, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has responded that it is yet to requisition the 68 posts to the Nagaland Public Service Commission. With the last date of applications, as advertised, fixed on the 21st of September, 2018,

apprehension has risen among the academic fraternity with regard to the fate of the 68 posts of Assistant Professors and librarian, which are clearly earmarked for the year 2018-19; and whether the exams can be conducted along with the recently advertised posts.

Therefore, in light of the above, we appeal to your esteemed office to kindly restore our faith and requisition the 68 posts (without any reservation of posts for regularisation for those appointed through backdoor) to the NPSC at the earliest for advertisement and ensure that the exams for the mentioned posts be conducted along with the recently advertised Common Education Service Examination, 2018.

It is felt that your timely intervention will go a long way in once again instilling faith among the thousands of young Naga aspirants in the recruitment system, in meritocracy and right to equal opportunity. It is also felt that your sagacity will be instrumental in giving hope to the future generation and in imparting better quality education.

The academic fraternity look forward to your positive response on this crucial matter of education."

While speaking on the inaugural day in Educational Ministerial meeting, Dr Satya Pal Singh, appreciated and thanked Argentina for hosting an exclusive meeting of Education Ministers for first time in the history of G20 Summit. He said that Education should be the first and foremost priority area for any society to develop and for any country to flourish. Therefore, it is most appropriate to place education at the center of global agenda.

Dr Singh said that India has been cradle of civilization and culture since ancient time. In modern time, India without forgetting its ancient wisdom has been making rapid strides in the field of education. He said that Prime Minister Modi has given immense importance to the education and therefore, India, under his initiative, has devised the strategy for its development which has core components of Accessibility, Equity, Quality, Affordability, Accountability, and Employability. He said that education should be 'Child Centric' and it should develop students holistically to make them a good human being first and global citizen later. To translate above philosophy in action, India is designing a new education policy.

He mentioned that India is one of the largest education systems in the world with over 1.53 million schools, 864 Universities and enrolment of about 300 million students. Despite hosting such a large education system, India still needs further expansion to improve accessibility. Dr Singh said in last 4 years enormous work has been done to achieve the same. He highlighted the several digital initiatives of Modi Government which include India's own MOOCs platform SWAYAM, which has been facilitating and encouraging a large number of students to learn anytime, anywhere. He said a special emphasis has been laid for teachers training by setting up National Resource Centres in 75 specific disciplines for delivering online refresher courses for 1.3 million faculty in higher education institutions.

Dr Singh apprised the gathering about the various initiatives of Innovation Index ranking of higher educational institutions, Smart India Hackathon in both software and hardware to find solutions for the problems faced by the Government, Industry and Academia by young undergraduate students, Atal Tinkering Labs in schools and Research Parks in higher education institutions to promote the design thinking and innovation, and joint research projects with international collaboration.

He said that we believe that education system should not only provide education but should also address the needs of the community directly. To achieve this, Government in India has launched 'Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan' under which higher education Institutions adopt nearby villages and help them by proving technological solutions to their problems.

Dr Singh said that India is a major economy in the World and we fully understand and realize our roles and responsibilities for furthering the cause of education and evolution of human being. He assured India's full support to the agenda of G20 Education Ministers meeting.

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched 'Skill India mission' in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries.

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India's achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers' Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

Dr Singh apprised them about recently launched initiatives of India for international collaboration. He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration). Education Ministers showed keen interests in all these schemes and assured India full cooperation. Italy, China, Japan, and USA also agreed to have an MoU with India. It was decided that further talks may be held to work out more details to develop roadmap for further collaboration. Dr Satya Pal Singh assured them that India will provide all support in their endeavor for bilateral collaboration.

The two meetings included Ministers of Education and Ministers for Labour and Employment from member countries as well as representatives of International Organizations like the World Bank, UNESCO."

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has said that education should be able to strengthen the values of the renaissance, humanity and secular ideals, calling on students to grow up as righteous people who can take in human culture transcending communal and casteist thoughts.

Inaugurating the second floor of the higher secondary block of the Chala Government Higher Secondary School here, and the State-wide launch of 'Relish', the project to improve the English language skill of secondary students, on Saturday, Mr. Vijayan said there was a time when a large section of people in the State had been denied the right to education based on their caste. That situation changed now. ""We won that right not because those who imposed the denial of education voluntarily withdrew it, but as a result of strong struggles."" The move from certain quarters to push people into old social conditions and the dark ages should be defeated, he said.

Mr. Vijayan said the State had reached the present condition by defeating casteist division and discrimination practised by the feudal system.

Students should understand facts and analyse subjects scientifically, he said, adding that the educational programmes being implemented in the State catered to that goal.

As a result of the education protection initiatives, the academic standard in government schools has been improved, he said.

With the new academic year set to commence in the next few months, there are various key decisions that are now lying in the backburner as the CM is yet to allot ministries to the newly-elected members of the assembly.

Take for instance the schedule for common entrance tests and school admissions. Last year, the Telangana State Council of Higher Education (TSCHE) had declared the schedule for all common entrance tests on December 28 and released the admission schedule for schools on December 30. However, this year, the government is yet to commence the process for the same. ""The release of the schedule will take another 2-3 weeks. We have to wait before the minister of education department is appointed,"" said Papi Reddy, chairman of TSCHE, adding that there won't be much of loss as there is sufficient time before the exams are held.

Finalising of a committee to issue notification for fee fixation of professional courses also lies pending. ""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years. Once we receive applications, the same shall be audited and subsequently fee will be fixed.

Other aspects such as affiliation process for intermediate colleges and finalization of admission process for degree courses are also pending.

Making matters worse, several key positions such as principal secretary, commissioner of school education and chairman of the TAFRC also have to be finalised by the new education minister.

The delay by the chief minister has not only irked the opposition parties but also the parents community. ""The fee hike issue has been pending for the last four years.

The government is not in favour of examination-centric education, and it aims to transform the education system from being teacher-centric to student-centric. It is also the objective of the education protection campaign, the Minister said.

He added that studies should be considered as a journey towards making discoveries, and that one does not gain much by learning things by heart. An A+ in life is more important than an A+ in examinations, and students, teachers, and parents should be sensitive to this significant aspect, Mr. Ravindranath said. He also called upon students to use their mother tongue as a tool to excel in life.

The Minister pointed out that parents and teachers should motivate students to excel in their own creative fields. Never should a student be discriminated against for not making the grade.

Javadekar also said a separate category would be created for smaller universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the HRD, to ensure that such institutions don't lose out to larger ones.

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers.

We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

The Minister said that we are focusing on research and innovation to boost research culture in the country. The Ministry of HRD successfully conducted two Smart India Hackathon in 2017 and 2018 and started process for third installment of Smart India Hackathon- 2019, he said.

The Minister further said that to promote innovation culture in India we have started Innovation Cell in AICTE and more than 1000 colleges started Innovation Club in their campuses. The research and innovation culture will make education more relevant and reliable, he added.

Beside these steps to promote quality education in the country we have increased budget amount for the higher education through HEFA, the Minister added. He said that India is improving its ranking in world class institutions but we want to enter in top 100 club of best institutions, therefore we are trying to make 20 Institutes of Eminence in the country, 10 each in public and private category.>"

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

Though the state Assembly is presently under suspended animation, the governor it would not be dissolved even if Jammu and Kashmir was placed under President's rule in December. This increases the chances of the NC-PDP-Congress alliance forming the next government.

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

The minister was speaking in reference to a series of attacks on migrant labourers working in factories in Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Gandhinagar. These attacks have lead to their exodus from the state.

Remembering a World War-II incident where the Maharaja of Jamnagar had sheltered a large number of Polish citizens, Chudasma told the gathering, ""I am remembering the Polish incident because today migrants are the talk of the town. We have given shelter to even the Polish, and these migrants are our brothers."" The minister recounted how the Polish survivors recently visited Jamnagar to express their gratitude to the Maharaja. ""Can we differentiate like that,"" he asked while going on to give a second example of how Parsis who arrived from Iran became a part of the society in Gujarat. ""If any person in the country says that Gujaratis are not allowed in Maharashtra, it will not work. No Bihari in Gujarat. Won't work. He is also our brother.""

He also asked members of Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan to ensure ""brotherhood"" prevails by sheltering and taking care of ""brothers from UP and Bihar"". ""At your respective workplaces... at some place there might be a brother from Uttar Pradesh who will be doing a small job. They should not be treated differently. They should be sheltered with love,"" he remarked.

Earlier, speaking at the occasion, Harshad Gilletwala, president of Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan pointed out that 70 percent of the workforce employed by the businessmen to load their goods carriers are migrants. ""You guys should also see who is instigating and spoiling the atmosphere,"" he added.

He was addressing a high-level meeting comprising the managers and principals of various aided and self-financing engineering, architecture, MBA and MCA colleges on Tuesday.

Jaleel has called for a complete make-over in the higher education system by making necessary changes in the conduct of examinations and valuation process. ""Special workshops will be conducted in engineering colleges and polytechnic institutions related to the revision of the curriculum in the coming days. The revision will also be done in the curriculum of Kerala Technology University which can benefit the engineering students. The entrance examination calendar will be revised immediately.

The institutions which come forward with the idea to start new courses will get due consideration. In addition, the government will liberalise the permanent affiliation proceedings for the colleges,"" Jaleel said. The other major decisions in the meeting included the launch of a web portal named 'For the students' in the minister's office. The students can enter any details, including queries related to the curriculum, in the portal. The details will be handed over to the respective universities or related centres for further action.

The Minister also laid stress on starting more entrance examination centres at foreign countries where the Malayali population is higher. However, he also shared apprehensions about the pathetic condition of certain self-financing engineering colleges in the state.

""Many colleges still don't have a sufficient number of students due to the dip in the quality of education. It was due to the unscientific approach by a section of people who opened colleges without any study. A student will get admission in an engineering college by securing only two per cent.

SAAC (State Assessment and Accreditation Council) and accreditation will be implemented in the state modelled on the lines of NAAC

The complaints by the students pertaining to the valuation of examinations will be sorted out.

The fine for the teachers who commit lapse in valuation has been increased from '5,000 to '25,000

Minimum qualification

The minister emphasised the colleges should ensure minimum qualification for the lecturers of the engineering colleges is MTech."

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

Though the exchange rate (value of rupee in terms of foreign currency) is determined by the market forces of demand and supply, role of RBI's interventions is also of great importance. Supply of dollars comes from the export of goods and services and also by inflow of foreign investment, both FDI and portfolio investment. On the other hand, demand for dollar comes from import for goods and services and outflow of foreign investment.

Is RBI's Approach Appropriate? Approach of the RBI, not to intervene in foreign exchange market, does not seem to be appropriate for many reasons. When the present regime took over the reign of power in 2014, foreign exchange reserves of India were hardly 312.4 billion dollars, which have increased to more than 400 billion dollars at present. In raising these reserves, net foreign institutional investment has a great contribution.

This approach is fundamentally inappropriate, because if RBI absorbs dollars when FIIs bring money, why doesn't RBI supply dollars when they go out? What Can We Do? It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits. Therefore, they don't have any obligation on transfer of money overnight. The government can impose a minimum 'lock-in-period' on the investments made by these FIIs, to keep them invested in India. In some countries tax is imposed on conversion of currency by FIIs, which is known as 'Tobin Tax'. This may also discourage the outflow of investment by FIIs. In the past few days the major reason for the depreciation of rupee has been the net sale of securities by FIIs and taking the money out of India. In such a situation demand for dollars increase overnight and in view of generally low supply of dollars rupee depreciates. A small scarcity of dollars causes a big fall in value of rupee. However, if we see, India doesn't have any deficiency of dollars per se. Today India is sitting at huge stock of foreign exchange reserves to the tune of more than 400 billion US dollars. Since the beginning of the year 2018 foreign exchange reserves have declined hardly by 11 billion US dollars, despite huge outflow of portfolio investment and rising crude prices. In the last one month FIIs have sent hardly 1.3 billion US dollars abroad. Extra burden on the economy due to increase in crude prices has been nearly 10 billion US dollars since the beginning of 2018. Since our foreign exchange reserve are more than sufficient to meet additional demand for dollar due to above mentioned factors, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) can easily intervene in the foreign exchange market to stem any depreciation of Indian rupee. RBI intervention may be win-win for economy We must understand that depreciation of rupee means a burden on economy. It increases the cost of debt servicing by both private sector and the Government. Cost of foreign travel and education also increases and so does the inflation. Foreign exchange reserves give promise to deal with the future payment problems, however, they do not earn any significant income. It is important to stabilize the value of rupee, to save the economy from problems related to depreciating rupee. Today Indian economy is in good shape, as GDP is rising fast with both industrial and agricultural production increasing and inflation is also under control.

He said, ancient Indian universities like Takshila, Nalanda and Vikramshila used to stress on innovations. Prime Minister said, knowledge and education cannot be gained only through books.

""Students should learn from their surroundings in place of just sticking to their textbooks,"" he added.

The Prime Minister called upon academics to not only impart education in classrooms of colleges and universities but connect their students with the aspirations of the country. Modi further said, higher education should equip students with high thinking, dignified behaviour and capability to solve the problems being faced by the society."

The conference was organized jointly by UGC, AICTE, ICSSR, IGNCA, IGNOU, JNU and SGT University. Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and MoS, HRD Dr Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought.

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today.

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of 'global citizen' or 'global village.' He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should ""Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate"", he added. He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE - Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure. He mentioned the steps taken for higher education.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living.

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given ""Brand India"" a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar lauded the vision and mission of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in providing holistic development in education sector with a stress on research and innovation. Shri Javadekar said that without innovation a nation cannot achieve sustainable growth, so the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives like IMPRINT, Smart India Hackathon (SIH), GIAN, SWAYAM and National Digital Library (NDL) to change the structure of the entire education system in this direction. The minister said that high technology research labs are being developed to promote brain gain as innovation in higher education is a key focus to support research within the country. He also informed that the budget allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore for Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) will also help to step up investment in research and related infrastructure. Government is promoting quality education in identified aspirational districts through RUSA, he added.

Shri Javadekar said that to ensure quality education, the ministry has developed learning outcomes, which will fix accountability on education providers. He also informed that for the overall development of students government has started ' Samagra Siksha' in which government is providing financial assistance to all government schools for library and sports and extended hostel facility for Katurba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya. The Union Minister congratulated all organizers for organizing the conference.

The Conference inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will have several sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

This Conference is in continuation of the efforts being made by the Ministry for evolving an action plan for transformation of the higher education sector. The first among this was held in Delhi during Vice-Chancellors' Conference from 26-28 July, 2018."

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

While chairing the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions.

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry's officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard.

In the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government's ""Empowerment without Appeasement"" policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to ""3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment"". In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet""."

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

From this year onwards, one should be a professor, a research scholar or a PhD holder to get appointed,"" mentioned minister.

These new set of guidelines for nomination/appointment of syndicate members have been submitted to CM H D Kumaraswamy.The minister even said that he had received recommendation letters from several politicians across all the parties to appoint syndicate members. ""I will personally sit with my department officials and shortlist the names. I don't bother if the candidates are affiliated to any political party, all I will look for, is their academic qualification and expertise in the field of education,"" he said."

""Various educational officers should coordinate to help the schools for preparing the action plan. DDEs should ensure that the master plans will bear fruit. The priority of the action plan should be to ensure the completion of 200 working days in the academic year as several school days were lost due to rain and flood,"" Raveendranath said.

He also listed out three priorities that need to be done as part of a quality improvement programme. The minister emphasized the need for academic and administrative monitoring in all schools at district level once in a month to ensure the smooth functioning of academic and administrative proceedings.

A five-member administrative committee has been constituted for overseeing the monitoring programme. The committee comprises a DDE, SSA officer, a teacher of District Institute of Education and Training (DIET), an expert of IT@school, district coordinators of rejuvenation programme.

""In the academic monitoring process, the DDEs should instruct school authorities to take special care of those students who are poor at studies. Proper planning is needed before the periodical monitoring at schools. We can't compromise on academic excellence. So the DDEs are also responsible for the academic performance of students.

Other major recommendations were to change the old pattern of examinations and to make the question papers and answer sheets available online. The valuation should begin immediately after the examinations. Jaleel made a point to the syndicate members on the recognition of certain courses between the universities in the state.

""Many students are struggling to get admission in a university if they transfer from other universities because of the grade is given to a course based on a university. So this should be prevented. For instance, some students who pass out from foreign and national universities are being told to produce equivalent course eligibility certificates,"" said Jaleel.

He also said that a State Assessment and Accreditation Council (SAAC) would be formulated soon to evaluate the performance of self-financing colleges. University syndicate members were also asked to make necessary changes in SAAC based on districts and areas.

He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

We, the Scholars/researchers/academicians from Nagaland working and pursuing studies from various universities across the country, are writing to you to express our deep concern and thereby draw your kind attention with regard to the failure to advertise the newly created post of 68 Assistant professors and Librarian in the recently advertised Common Education Services Examination 2018 by the Nagaland Public Service Commision. As you are well aware that the state cabinet has approved the creation of 110 Assistant Professors posts to be recruited within the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 vide the Office Memorandum No. CAB 2/ 2013, Sl. No 5, dated 4th of July 2018. The office memorandum clearly mentions that 68 of the 110 posts were to be created within the year 2018-2019 and the remaining 42 within 2019-2020.

Accordingly, the honourable Governor of Nagaland has given his consent by approving the recruitment of the 68 posts on the 9th of August, 2018, through the notification No. HE/ESTT/2-6/207. It may be humbly mentioned that both documents- the notification and the office memorandum of the state cabinet- were widely circulated in social media.

As such, the decision of the State Cabinet to create a sizable number of Assistant Professor posts for the year 2018-19 has been a positive departure from the existing trends.

Hence, this noble decision taken under your able leadership is a testimony of you giving due importance to meritocracy and bettering the quality of higher Education in the state; your decision has also been widely commended and welcomed by the academic fraternity. In view of this, all NET/PhD qualified, assistant professor aspirants have been waiting in great anticipation for the announcement of the said posts by the NPSC. However, much to our disappointment, when the Nagaland

Public Service Commission advertised the Common Education Service Examination, 2018, for various posts of Assistant Professor and Post Graduate Teacher, the 68 posts meant to be recruited within 2018-2019 were not included. On enquiry, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has responded that it is yet to requisition the 68 posts to the Nagaland Public Service Commission. With the last date of applications, as advertised, fixed on the 21st of September, 2018,

apprehension has risen among the academic fraternity with regard to the fate of the 68 posts of Assistant Professors and librarian, which are clearly earmarked for the year 2018-19; and whether the exams can be conducted along with the recently advertised posts.

Therefore, in light of the above, we appeal to your esteemed office to kindly restore our faith and requisition the 68 posts (without any reservation of posts for regularisation for those appointed through backdoor) to the NPSC at the earliest for advertisement and ensure that the exams for the mentioned posts be conducted along with the recently advertised Common Education Service Examination, 2018.

It is felt that your timely intervention will go a long way in once again instilling faith among the thousands of young Naga aspirants in the recruitment system, in meritocracy and right to equal opportunity. It is also felt that your sagacity will be instrumental in giving hope to the future generation and in imparting better quality education.

The academic fraternity look forward to your positive response on this crucial matter of education."

While speaking on the inaugural day in Educational Ministerial meeting, Dr Satya Pal Singh, appreciated and thanked Argentina for hosting an exclusive meeting of Education Ministers for first time in the history of G20 Summit. He said that Education should be the first and foremost priority area for any society to develop and for any country to flourish. Therefore, it is most appropriate to place education at the center of global agenda.

Dr Singh said that India has been cradle of civilization and culture since ancient time. In modern time, India without forgetting its ancient wisdom has been making rapid strides in the field of education. He said that Prime Minister Modi has given immense importance to the education and therefore, India, under his initiative, has devised the strategy for its development which has core components of Accessibility, Equity, Quality, Affordability, Accountability, and Employability. He said that education should be 'Child Centric' and it should develop students holistically to make them a good human being first and global citizen later. To translate above philosophy in action, India is designing a new education policy.

He mentioned that India is one of the largest education systems in the world with over 1.53 million schools, 864 Universities and enrolment of about 300 million students. Despite hosting such a large education system, India still needs further expansion to improve accessibility. Dr Singh said in last 4 years enormous work has been done to achieve the same. He highlighted the several digital initiatives of Modi Government which include India's own MOOCs platform SWAYAM, which has been facilitating and encouraging a large number of students to learn anytime, anywhere. He said a special emphasis has been laid for teachers training by setting up National Resource Centres in 75 specific disciplines for delivering online refresher courses for 1.3 million faculty in higher education institutions.

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched 'Skill India mission' in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries.

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India's achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers' Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration).

(If you don't clap in your teacher's honour, you will end up clapping outside every household in your next birth)

The minister's comments, which sound derogatory to the community, gained huge applause from the crowd, he then said, ""Iska matlab hai koi agle janam mein ghar-ghar jaakar taliyan nahi bajana chahta."" (It seems that no one wants to clap in next birth)

Traditionally, clapping at people's doorstep is a practice exercised by transgenders in India in order to seek donations for their livelihood. Also, the transgender community is looked down upon by the people.

Shah is not new to controversies. In 2013, he had to resign from his post of state's tribal minister after allegedly making derogatory remarks against BJP leader Nirmala Bhuria and the Chief Minister's wife Sadhna Singh. Shah made the alleged remarks while attending a summer camp in Jhabhua district.

In 2010, Shah had also faced criticism for organising belly dance show near a holy shrine in Malgaon. He was also accused of organising a grand birthday celebration on government expense."

After BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam told youngsters during a Dahi Handi event on Janamashtmi that he will abduct girls for them if they did not respond to their advances, the next BJP member to join the bandwagon is Madhya Pradesh's Education Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah.

Addressing a gathering on the ocassion of Teacher's Day, Shah ridiculed transgenders of the nation. Speaking to youngsters, the education minister said that if they won't clap in the honour of their teacher, they will have to go and clap in front of every home in their next birth.

""Agar Guru ke samman mein apne taaliyan nahi bajayi to agle janam mein ghar ghar ja kar taaliyan bajani padengi"", Shah said. Such an insensitive comment coming from an education minister calls for some introspection for the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government in the central Indian state. The surprising part about his comment was that after he had made the derogatory statement about transgenders, he even laughed.

This is not the first instance when a BJP leader has made an insensitive or unscientific remark in a public gathering. Recently Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Dev had said that ducks raise the oxygen level in water bodies when they swim.

More recently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was criticised for advising people in Mathura to read the Hanuman Chalisa to get rid of the notorious monkeys in the city. Speaking on the Ram Mandir issue, Adityanath had said that the date of construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will be decided by Lord Ram himself.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks about a tea stall owner making tea from gutter gas had also left social media in splits. We wonder who is going to be next in line to make insensitive, regressive and unscientific statements unabashedly."

Inaugurating the second floor of the higher secondary block of the Chala Government Higher Secondary School here, and the State-wide launch of 'Relish', the project to improve the English language skill of secondary students, on Saturday, Mr. Vijayan said there was a time when a large section of people in the State had been denied the right to education based on their caste.

""First, a committee is constituted that will issue a notification calling applications from private colleges to fix the fee structure for the next three years.

Javadekar also said a separate category would be created for smaller universities in the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) of the HRD, to ensure that such institutions don't lose out to larger ones.

Mr Javadekar was speaking at the national Conference on 'Positioning India on the Global Education Map' in New Delhi today. In higher education, we have taken tremendous steps to improve college education, for this we are making accreditation process more scientific and tough. Government wants to increase the strength of NBA and NAAC so that more number of institutions can be accredited, the Minister added.

He further said that government is open for other agencies to take the responsibility of accreditation and IITs and IIMs have been asked for the same so that more and more institutions can be accredited from reputed agencies.

The Minister said that ranking and rating increase competitiveness among institutions for better performance. He gave the example of National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) and said that because of NIRF every institute has constituted an internal committee to improve the ranking. Students also see institutions ranking before taking admission, he added.

The Union Minister said that teacher is the most important component to increase quality educationin the colleges and universities. He said that attendance should increase in the classroom because of teacher's skills not because of the infrastructure of the college. He further said that we are lacking good teachers in the institutions because good people are not becoming teachers.

We have to attract good people for teaching profession and we have to give respect to teachers then only we can create a good learning environment in the institutions. Best teachers attract students to the institution not the best infrastructure, he added.

Graded autonomy is another major step of the government to boost quality education in the country, the Minister said. Shri Javadekar explained that the universities will remain within the ambit of UGC but will have the freedom to start new courses, off campus centers, skill development courses, research parks and any other new academic programs. They will also have the freedom to hire foreign faculty, enroll foreign students, give incentive based emoluments to the faculty, enter into academic collaborations and run open distance learning programmes.

The Minister said that we are focusing on research and innovation to boost research culture in the country. The Ministry of HRD successfully conducted two Smart India Hackathon in 2017 and 2018 and started process for third installment of Smart India Hackathon- 2019, he said.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack.

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

The building will also house the new BA Honours courses.""The aim is to establish a single window system for admissions to all the universities in the state,"" he said.

""The government has initiated steps to attract more students to government colleges by improving the infrastructural facilities in the institutions. From the next academic year the number of seats in the government colleges will be increased. More new courses need to be started in government colleges,"" said the minister.

He assured that the basic infrastructure of the institutions will be improved in order to attract more and more students from the northern states and also outside the country. The aim of the government is to attract at least 100 international students to gain admissions at the various institutions. ""The campaign will be started from the next academic year. It will highlight how the campuses in Kerala don't differentiate students based on their caste, creed or religion,"" he said.

He revealed that of the 50,000 seats available in the engineering colleges in the state, nearly 50 percent are remaining vacant. ""Only half of the applicants are writing the engineering entrance examination. The system of selecting students through entrance examination started when there were only 12 colleges.

The new vacancy could not have come at a better time for interim-chairman of Legislative Council Basavaraj Horatti, who has been reluctant to continue in the post. Horatti has been gunning for the Primary and Secondary Education ministry since the formation of the coalition government.

The JD(S) leadership had tried to pacify Horatti by offering him the post of Council Chairman and he took up the post as an interim arrangement. Meanwhile, Horatti met former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda on Thursday and is said to have made a strong plea to get the Primary and Secondary Education ministry.

JD(S), which got a quota of 12 berths in the coalition government, had offered one berth to its ally BSP. JD(S) had filled 11 berths leaving one slot vacant. The number of vacant slots in the ministry from JD(S) quota has now increased to two and lobbying has started for the same.

Under fire for attacks on migrants in Gujarat, the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma on Friday described the migrant-labour force as 'brothers' and appealed to the businessmen state to ensure that the state's image of Vibrant Gujarat built by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remain blemish-free.

""Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Gujarat through the Vibrant Gujarat summits have built an image for itself across the globe in the past 15 years. It is our combined responsibility to ensure that this image of the state remains blemish-free,"" said Chudasma at an awards function of the Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan, a body of small businessmen and traders that employ huge number of migrants as workforce. The minister was speaking in reference to a series of attacks on migrant labourers working in factories in Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Gandhinagar. These attacks have lead to their exodus from the state.

Remembering a World War-II incident where the Maharaja of Jamnagar had sheltered a large number of Polish citizens, Chudasma told the gathering, ""I am remembering the Polish incident because today migrants are the talk of the town. We have given shelter to even the Polish, and these migrants are our brothers."" The minister recounted how the Polish survivors recently visited Jamnagar to express their gratitude to the Maharaja. ""Can we differentiate like that,"" he asked while going on to give a second example of how Parsis who arrived from Iran became a part of the society in Gujarat. ""If any person in the country says that Gujaratis are not allowed in Maharashtra, it will not work. No Bihari in Gujarat. Won't work. He is also our brother.""

He also asked members of Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan to ensure ""brotherhood"" prevails by sheltering and taking care of ""brothers from UP and Bihar"". ""At your respective workplaces... at some place there might be a brother from Uttar Pradesh who will be doing a small job. They should not be treated differently. They should be sheltered with love,"" he remarked.

Earlier, speaking at the occasion, Harshad Gilletwala, president of Ahmedabad Vepari Mahajan pointed out that 70 percent of the workforce employed by the businessmen to load their goods carriers are migrants. ""You guys should also see who is instigating and spoiling the atmosphere,"" he added.

He was addressing a high-level meeting comprising the managers and principals of various aided and self-financing engineering, architecture, MBA and MCA colleges on Tuesday.

Jaleel has called for a complete make-over in the higher education system by making necessary changes in the conduct of examinations and valuation process. ""Special workshops will be conducted in engineering colleges and polytechnic institutions related to the revision of the curriculum in the coming days. The revision will also be done in the curriculum of Kerala Technology University which can benefit the engineering students. The entrance examination calendar will be revised immediately.

The institutions which come forward with the idea to start new courses will get due consideration.

The other major decisions in the meeting included the launch of a web portal named 'For the students' in the minister's office. The students can enter any details, including queries related to the curriculum, in the portal. The details will be handed over to the respective universities or related centres for further action.

The Minister also laid stress on starting more entrance examination centres at foreign countries where the Malayali population is higher. However, he also shared apprehensions about the pathetic condition of certain self-financing engineering colleges in the state.

""Many colleges still don't have a sufficient number of students due to the dip in the quality of education. It was due to the unscientific approach by a section of people who opened colleges without any study. A student will get admission in an engineering college by securing only two per cent.

SAAC (State Assessment and Accreditation Council) and accreditation will be implemented in the state modelled on the lines of NAAC

The complaints by the students pertaining to the valuation of examinations will be sorted out.

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

It is true that Government does not have any control on the factors causing the depreciation of rupee in the recent past. Rising oil prices are leading to increase in Current Account Deficit (CAD). On the other hand increase in interest rates by US Federal Reserves and reduction in income tax rates by US administration are encouraging reverse flow of investment by FIIs. However, in the long run Government has a role to play in reducing the outflow of money by FIIs by making efforts to disciplining them. It is notable that FIIs do not pay any taxes on their profits. Therefore, they don't have any obligation on transfer of money overnight. The government can impose a minimum 'lock-in-period' on the investments made by these FIIs, to keep them invested in India. In some countries tax is imposed on conversion of currency by FIIs, which is known as 'Tobin Tax'. This may also discourage the outflow of investment by FIIs. In the past few days the major reason for the depreciation of rupee has been the net sale of securities by FIIs and taking the money out of India.

However, if we see, India doesn't have any deficiency of dollars per se. Today India is sitting at huge stock of foreign exchange reserves to the tune of more than 400 billion US dollars.

HARYANA EDUCATION Minister Ram Bilas Sharma will now be teaching at Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village of Morni hills in Panchkula district, once every month. The school is located around 45 kms from Panchkula.

""My decision will also draw the local administration's attention towards this school. I have already taught in 1996 and will now do so again after a long hiatus. In fact, students and teachers of other schools nearby will also feel encouraged when I go to this school in Koti to teach,"" Sharma told Chandigarh Newsline. ""Most probably, I will teach Sanskrit,"" Sharma added. Out of a total 250 students, there are around 150 of classes VI to X who have Sanskrit.

After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories, highlighted the plight of at least 100 students of this school who come from nearby villages and have to cross a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar to reach school daily, Sharma visited the school on Friday and spoke with the teachers and students.

For these students, who come to school daily from villages covered under three gram panchayats, Bhoj Koti, Rajji Tikri and Thandog, Sharma has directed officers of the district administration and PWD to construct a proper bridge that would allow students to cross the river safely. PWD officials told Newsline that construction of the bridge shall commence by October 15 and it will be completed before next monsoon.

The school also has a number of students who walk long distances daily from village Johrian to reach Koti. For them, Sharma directed the education department to arrange daily transport service. ""During my interaction with the school authorities, I learnt that many students have to walk long distances daily to reach school. Government will soon begin maxi-cab service for these students,"" Sharma told Newsline.

""The minister has expressed desire to teach students every month. We will be seeking his availability after October 20,"" said P K Jain, principal of the school.

Sharma also announced that the school should be converted into a model school.

""We required two additional acres of land to upgrade the school. Villages who own adjacent land are being contacted for the same. The minister has also announced that a hostel for students and accommodation for teachers shall be constructed here,"" Jain told Newsline.

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning. ""Students in private schools are like parrots and only repeat what you say. Whereas students in government schools are eagles and make their voice heard,"" he said, and added that government school students even argue with their teachers to get their point across.

He then went on to question the role of private schools in society, and claimed that they only contribute to the betterment of Switzerland, America, and Russia. ""Government school students, on the other hand, contribute to society by becoming police officials and taking up other jobs in our country,"" Mr. Mahesh said.

He commended government school students for their behaviour, and said they were hundred times more intelligent than those in private schools.

Private school managements have demanded his resignation. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said they condemn the Minister's statement.

""How can the Education Minister make a statement showing private schools in poor light? His understanding of education is very poor and we urge the Chief Minister to change his portfolio as he is unfit to be the Education Minister,"" said Mr. Kumar.

He said managements were deeply hurt by his irresponsible statements which amounted to discrimination against their students.

""Students should learn from their surroundings in place of just sticking to their textbooks,"" he added.

The conference was organized jointly by UGC, AICTE, ICSSR, IGNCA, IGNOU, JNU and SGT University. Union Minister for Human Resource Development Shri Prakash Javadekar and MoS, HRD Dr Satya Pal Singh were also present on the occasion.

Speaking on the occasion the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi said that when one thinks of resurgence or revival, the first image that comes to mind is of Swami Vivekananda, who presented before the world, the strength of Indian thought.

The Prime Minister recalled Swami Vivekananda's emphasis on self-reliance, character building, and human values, as elements of education. The Prime Minister said innovation is another vital element of education today.

Recalling the ancient Indian texts, the Vedas, the Prime Minister said that we cannot imagine our society, our country, and even our lives, without knowledge. He said that our ancient universities such as Taxila, Nalanda and Vikramshila, gave importance to innovation, besides knowledge. The Prime Minister also recalled the views on education of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Deendayal Upadhyay, and Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia.

Shri Narendra Modi said that today, no country or person can live in isolation. He mentioned the importance of thinking in terms of 'global citizen' or 'global village.' He said our Universities and Colleges should be leveraged to find solutions to the challenges facing us. We should ""Interlink Institutions to Innovate and Incubate"", he added. He urged students to link their classroom learnings to the aspirations of the country. He also mentioned Atal Tinkering Labs which have been set up to encourage children to innovate. He mentioned the RISE - Revitalization of Infrastructure and Systems in Education -programme for improving education infrastructure. He mentioned the steps taken for higher education.

The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of preparing good teachers for society. He also said that scholars and students can take responsibility for spreading digital literacy, and generating greater awareness of government programmes that can improve ease of living.

The Prime Minister said that the youth has given ""Brand India"" a global identity. He mentioned schemes such as Start Up India, Stand Up India and Skill India, which are aimed at nurturing young talent.

The theme of the Conference is to deliberate on the challenges facing the Indian education system and to work out a plan for a paradigm shift both in terms of achieving academic outcomes and also in regulation of education.

While addressing the gathering, Shri Prakash Javadekar lauded the vision and mission of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi in providing holistic development in education sector with a stress on research and innovation. Shri Javadekar said that without innovation a nation cannot achieve sustainable growth, so the Ministry of Human Resource Development has taken a number of initiatives like IMPRINT, Smart India Hackathon (SIH), GIAN, SWAYAM and National Digital Library (NDL) to change the structure of the entire education system in this direction. The minister said that high technology research labs are being developed to promote brain gain as innovation in higher education is a key focus to support research within the country. He also informed that the budget allocation of Rs 1,00,000 crore for Revitalising Infrastructure and Systems in Education (RISE) will also help to step up investment in research and related infrastructure. Government is promoting quality education in identified aspirational districts through RUSA, he added.

Shri Javadekar said that to ensure quality education, the ministry has developed learning outcomes, which will fix accountability on education providers. He also informed that for the overall development of students government has started ' Samagra Siksha' in which government is providing financial assistance to all government schools for library and sports and extended hostel facility for Katurba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya. The Union Minister congratulated all organizers for organizing the conference.

The Conference inaugurated by the Prime Minister, will have several sessions covering eight thematic areas namely:

The valedictory session will be chaired by Shri Prakash Javadekar, Minister for Human Resource Development in which each of the eight groups will make presentation on the course of action that they have agreed upon. This will be debated further in the Plenary Session and it is expected that a comprehensive action plan would emerge for improving the higher education sector in the country.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

While chairing the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, Shri Naqvi said that the educational institution, being set up in Alwar, will start functioning in 2020.

Shri Naqvi said that the Rajasthan Government has given 15 acres of land in Kohrapipali village in Kishangarh Bas tehsil of Alwar district for this educational institute. World class research centres, labs, libraries, educational facilities for primary to higher studies and sports facilities will be established here. He said that these world class institutions will provide education in technical, medical, Ayurved, Unani and job-oriented skill development courses etc. We have proposed 40 per cent reservation for girls in these institutions.

A 3-member committee of Minority Affairs Ministry's officials and members of the Maulana Azad Education Foundation has been constituted to chalk out the entire process of the institute at Alwar. Soon, the detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared regarding construction and other process for the institute. The Minority Affairs Ministry had worked out on a plan a year ago to establish world class educational institutes for poor, backward and Minorities and a 11-member committee, headed by former Secretary, Govt. of India, Shri Afzal Amanullah, had been constituted in this regard.

In the 57 meeting of General Body and 101 meeting of Governing Body of Maulana Azad Educational Foundation, various schemes for educational empowerment of minorities, ""Begum Hazrat Mahal Girls Scholarship"", ""Gharib Nawaz Kaushal Vikas Yojana"", other scholarship programmes were reviewed.

Shri Naqvi said that during the last about 4 years, the Central Government's ""Empowerment without Appeasement"" policy has ensured that record about 3 crore students belonging to poor and weaker sections of Minorities have been benefitted from various scholarship programmes. The beneficiaries include about 1 crore 63 lakh girls.

Shri Naqvi said that school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35-40 per cent due to awareness and educational empowerment programmes of the Government. Our goal is to bring it down to zero per cent. Transparent and hassle-free scholarship system has played a key role in this endeavour. This year, ""National Scholarship Portal Mobile App"" (NSP Mobile App) has been launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from poor and weaker sections.

Shri Naqvi said that Ministry of Minority Affairs has worked with commitment to ""3E- Education, Employment & Empowerment"". In the last about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all Minority communities including Madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with ""3T-Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet""."

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death. There was a violent mob at the school which had illegal firearms and bombs so we don't yet know whose guns killed the two people. Police had not opened fire on the protesters.""

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

Despite the police washing off its hand from the incident, victims' relatives claimed that cops with masked faces had shot the two students with silencer-fitted guns.""My son was supervising construction work at our shop outside our residence when he was shot by a policeman who was wearing blue uniform and had his face covered with a black cloth,"" deceased Tapas Barman's mother said.

Chatterjee criticised the BJP-led central government for trying to ""malign and politicise"" the Army. The BJP said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the central government.

On September 29 in 2016, the Indian Army carried out 'surgical strikes' on seven terrorist launchpads across the LoC as a response to an attack on its base in Uri earlier that month. The Indian Army had said its special forces inflicted ""significant casualties"" on terrorists waiting there to cross onto the Indian territory.

""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using the UGC ahead of elections. It is a matter of shame that they are using the UGC to achieve their political agenda. We won't abide by the directions of UGC,"" Chatterjee said.

The University Grants Commission yesterday directed varsities and higher education institutions across the country to observe September 29 as ""Surgical Strike Day"".

Talk sessions by ex-servicemen about sacrifices by the armed forces, special parades by NCC and visit to exhibitions are among the prescribed events by the University Grants Commission for the celebration.

Chatterjee said, ""We would have understood it had they asked us to observe the day in the name of sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

""The Indian Army has always been kept above politics and controversies. But now we are seeing that the BJP is trying to malign and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

Reacting to the allegations, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the Centre.

""Earlier also, we had seen Bengal government opposing directions by the UGC. This is not new,"" he said."

For instance, some students who pass out from foreign and national universities are being told to produce equivalent course eligibility certificates,"" said Jaleel.

We, the Scholars/researchers/academicians from Nagaland working and pursuing studies from various universities across the country, are writing to you to express our deep concern and thereby draw your kind attention with regard to the failure to advertise the newly created post of 68 Assistant professors and Librarian in the recently advertised Common Education Services Examination 2018 by the Nagaland Public Service Commision. As you are well aware that the state cabinet has approved the creation of 110 Assistant Professors posts to be recruited within the year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 vide the Office Memorandum No. CAB 2/ 2013, Sl. No 5, dated 4th of July 2018. The office memorandum clearly mentions that 68 of the 110 posts were to be created within the year 2018-2019 and the remaining 42 within 2019-2020.

Accordingly, the honourable Governor of Nagaland has given his consent by approving the recruitment of the 68 posts on the 9th of August, 2018, through the notification No. HE/ESTT/2-6/207. It may be humbly mentioned that both documents- the notification and the office memorandum of the state cabinet- were widely circulated in social media.

As such, the decision of the State Cabinet to create a sizable number of Assistant Professor posts for the year 2018-19 has been a positive departure from the existing trends.

Hence, this noble decision taken under your able leadership is a testimony of you giving due importance to meritocracy and bettering the quality of higher Education in the state; your decision has also been widely commended and welcomed by the academic fraternity. In view of this, all NET/PhD qualified, assistant professor aspirants have been waiting in great anticipation for the announcement of the said posts by the NPSC. However, much to our disappointment, when the Nagaland

Public Service Commission advertised the Common Education Service Examination, 2018, for various posts of Assistant Professor and Post Graduate Teacher, the 68 posts meant to be recruited within 2018-2019 were not included. On enquiry, the Department of Higher and Technical Education has responded that it is yet to requisition the 68 posts to the Nagaland Public Service Commission. With the last date of applications, as advertised, fixed on the 21st of September, 2018,

apprehension has risen among the academic fraternity with regard to the fate of the 68 posts of Assistant Professors and librarian, which are clearly earmarked for the year 2018-19; and whether the exams can be conducted along with the recently advertised posts.

Therefore, in light of the above, we appeal to your esteemed office to kindly restore our faith and requisition the 68 posts (without any reservation of posts for regularisation for those appointed through backdoor) to the NPSC at the earliest for advertisement and ensure that the exams for the mentioned posts be conducted along with the recently advertised Common Education Service Examination, 2018.

It is felt that your timely intervention will go a long way in once again instilling faith among the thousands of young Naga aspirants in the recruitment system, in meritocracy and right to equal opportunity. It is also felt that your sagacity will be instrumental in giving hope to the future generation and in imparting better quality education.

The academic fraternity look forward to your positive response on this crucial matter of education."

He said that we believe that education system should not only provide education but should also address the needs of the community directly. To achieve this, Government in India has launched 'Unnat Bharat Abhiyaan' under which higher education Institutions adopt nearby villages and help them by proving technological solutions to their problems.

Dr Singh said that India is a major economy in the World and we fully understand and realize our roles and responsibilities for furthering the cause of education and evolution of human being. He assured India's full support to the agenda of G20 Education Ministers meeting.

With active help of India, G20 Education Ministers' Declaration 2018 was finalized. [Copy attached]

On the second day, Dr Satya Pal Singh addressed the Joint Ministerial Meeting which comprised the Education Ministers and Labor & Employment Ministers of member countries. He said that India enjoys demographic dividend as 52% of its population is below 25 years of age. While it is a unique advantage, it also poses a challenge to utilize them productively towards the development and progress of the country. Realizing this, the Prime Minister of India has launched 'Skill India mission' in 2015 with a view to skilling 400 million youth by 2022. Vocationalization of the education has been undertaken at a large scale. He apprised that National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) has been laid down under which learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning, leading to Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma, Degree and further advanced studies and research.

Dr Singh said that G20 is the most appropriate forum for the creation of a collaborative framework where transnational skilling standards are shared with countries.

He ended his address with once again thanking Argentinian Government and G20 Group for affording him an opportunity to showcase India's achievements, concerns and future plans. At the end of the meeting, G20 Joint Education & Labour and Employment Ministers' Declaration 2018 Mendoza Joint Meeting was released.

He showcased the progress made by India in the field of education. He said that while India has a lot to offer, it also desires to learn from other countries to take its education sector to greater height. Dr Singh apprised them about recently launched initiatives of India for international collaboration. He elucidated salient features of Study in India, GIAN (Global Initiatives for Academic Initiatives) and SPARC (Scheme for Promotion of Academic & Research Collaboration). Education Ministers showed keen interests in all these schemes and assured India full cooperation. Italy, China, Japan, and USA also agreed to have an MoU with India. It was decided that further talks may be held to work out more details to develop roadmap for further collaboration. Dr Satya Pal Singh assured them that India will provide all support in their endeavor for bilateral collaboration.

The two meetings included Ministers of Education and Ministers for Labour and Employment from member countries as well as representatives of International Organizations like the World Bank, UNESCO."

Mysuru: The students of the Karnataka State Dr. Gangubai Hangal Music and Performing Arts University scaled down their protest on day three this morning, after a meeting with JD(S) District Youth President Girish Gowda, representative of Higher Education Minister G.T. Devegowda and the Registrar Prof. Nagesh Bettakote.

The students, on the assurance that GTD will personally come on Sept.10 to the campus to listen to their problems and try to solve them, decided to withdraw the protest. However, they said that they would continue to agitate inside the Varsity with songs and playing instruments till their demands are met.

Meanwhile, on the second day yesterday they wore black bands and were shouting slogans against the University authorities at the premises on JLB Road in Lakshmipuram. On hearing about the protest, MLA S.A. Ramdas visited the spot and heard about the students' problems.

Later, he met the in-charge Vice-Chancellor Prof. R. Rajesh, Registrar Prof. Nagesh Bettakote and Engineer Ramamurthy and discussed the issues with them.

He asked them to first take steps to provide five classrooms. He directed the engineer to immediately call for tender. Asking the authorities to provide the toilet facilities to women at the earliest, he said that if it was not possible for them, he would help in building the toilets.

Ramdas assured that he would talk to the Corporation authorities and arrange for drinking water facilities. As it is a Music University, lot of cultural programmes are held regularly. Hence, the students need a proper stage and auditorium to rehearse.

There are also requirements for projectors and audio studio, besides other demands and he promised to fulfil all of them.

Since the Music University comes under his K.R. Constituency, he said that he would concentrate on all development works that is required for the Music University.

Madhya Pradesh Education Minister Vijay Shah had a special message for students on Teacher's Day - ""Agar Guru ke samman mein apne taaliyan nahi bajayi to agle janam mein ghar ghar ja kar taaliyan bajani padengi."" (If you don't clap in your teacher's honour, you will end up clapping outside every household in your next birth)

The minister's comments, which sound derogatory to the community, gained huge applause from the crowd, he then said, ""Iska matlab hai koi agle janam mein ghar-ghar jaakar taliyan nahi bajana chahta."" (It seems that no one wants to clap in next birth)

Traditionally, clapping at people's doorstep is a practice exercised by transgenders in India in order to seek donations for their livelihood. Also, the transgender community is looked down upon by the people.

Shah is not new to controversies. In 2013, he had to resign from his post of state's tribal minister after allegedly making derogatory remarks against BJP leader Nirmala Bhuria and the Chief Minister's wife Sadhna Singh. Shah made the alleged remarks while attending a summer camp in Jhabhua district.

In 2010, Shah had also faced criticism for organising belly dance show near a holy shrine in Malgaon. He was also accused of organising a grand birthday celebration on government expense."

It seems like the leaders of Bhartiya Janata Party are involved in a weird kind of competition as to who can speak the most nonsensical stuff that's possible. After BJP MLA from Mumbai Ram Kadam told youngsters during a Dahi Handi event on Janamashtmi that he will abduct girls for them if they did not respond to their advances, the next BJP member to join the bandwagon is Madhya Pradesh's Education Minister Kunwar Vijay Shah.

Addressing a gathering on the ocassion of Teacher's Day, Shah ridiculed transgenders of the nation. Speaking to youngsters, the education minister said that if they won't clap in the honour of their teacher, they will have to go and clap in front of every home in their next birth.

""Agar Guru ke samman mein apne taaliyan nahi bajayi to agle janam mein ghar ghar ja kar taaliyan bajani padengi"", Shah said. Such an insensitive comment coming from an education minister calls for some introspection for the Shivraj Singh Chouhan-led BJP government in the central Indian state. The surprising part about his comment was that after he had made the derogatory statement about transgenders, he even laughed.

This is not the first instance when a BJP leader has made an insensitive or unscientific remark in a public gathering. Recently Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Dev had said that ducks raise the oxygen level in water bodies when they swim.

More recently, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was criticised for advising people in Mathura to read the Hanuman Chalisa to get rid of the notorious monkeys in the city. Speaking on the Ram Mandir issue, Adityanath had said that the date of construction of the Ram Mandir in Ayodhya will be decided by Lord Ram himself.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks about a tea stall owner making tea from gutter gas had also left social media in splits. We wonder who is going to be next in line to make insensitive, regressive and unscientific statements unabashedly."
