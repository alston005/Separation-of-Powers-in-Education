Though some or most parts of that ideology may not be adhered to, the very fact that a proper ideology and/or action programme has been formulated shows that the party hierarchy is wedded to what has been enumerated. Moreover, political parties with long years of struggle have better and wider experience of nation building though the leadership may not have the required experience of what needs to be done for the masses, i.e. the right strategy for development.

The right priorities for ensuring development for the major section of the population is obviously the key and not just calculating GDP growth on wrong assumptions and data. The crisis plaguing the Government on the economic front lies in lack of infrastructure development and investment in the farm sector. This is being echoed again and again by economists of all shades and more so after the results of the recent elections.

On the social front, the country cannot be allowed to be divided on communal or religious lines. We are a secular country and population belonging to whatever religion, sect, caste or class should enjoy same benefits and allowed to stay without any fear on their rights and privileges. In a functional democracy, every individual should have rights to voice their opinion, which may be critical to the policies advocated by the party in power.

It is a well known fact that the poor and impoverished are at the receiving end and the present situation has accentuated the crisis. Lack of proper governance and wanton corruption is manifest all around to aid the rich and the powerful in all matters.

In this connection, it may be pertinent to refer to the poor social infrastructure in the rural countryside on India considered an emerging economy. This is manifest from a recent report of Niti Aayog titled Strategy for New [email protected], it has rightly been pointed out that expenditure in education has to be increased to six per cent of GDP which has been echoed by educationists for quite some time. The report suggested testing teachers tri-annually on the same test designed for their students and putting greater emphasis on continuous and comprehensive evaluation to boost education outcomes.

In the health sector, the report highlighted shortage of doctors, nurses and paramedics and called for reforms and regulation of medical education to raise number of doctors and specialists. The document rightly suggested achieving a doctor-population ratio of at least 1:1400 against the WHO norm of 1:1000 and nurse population ratio of at least 1:500 by 2022-23. It also proposed generating at least 1.5 million jobs in the public health sector by 2022-23, a large number of which may employ women.

The pitiable condition of health centres in most villages, specially in the North and Central India is also there not to speak of sub-divisional hospitals. These are places where the poor and the economically weaker sections and also the low income groups go for treatment but are frustrated at the state of affairs there. It is imperative for the policy makers to ponder over the matter before thinking of bullet trains and modernising airports which are all aimed at the upper echelons of society. In this connection, the Niti Aayog document has suggested incentivising State governments to invest in creating a dedicated cadre for public health at the State, district and block levels and including Ayush into the mainstream.

Coming to the political parties, the BJP has performed in a rather poor manner, both in the social and economic front. Primarily it has antagonised the minorities, specially the Muslims and encroached on their lifestyles and food habits. Moreover, the dalits, the scheduled castes and tribes have felt betrayed due to lack of concern for these backward castes. In fact, there is social chaos all around but more distressing is that there are apprehensions of the intrinsic unity being eroded.

The scenario all around is one of mistrust and hatred coupled with lack of freedom of expression. Dissent is not tolerated by most political parties with BJP leading the way. Unfortunately, this has never happened in the country before and most intellectuals are frustrated with the attitude of the ruling party at the Centre.

The Congress with its glorious past may be the only national alternative in the present state of affairs. With its right ideological moorings - most of which it may not have been followed - is well geared to take the country in the right track and save it from being divided on religious, caste and class lines. There may have been failures in the past but learning from its past experience it appears that the party may follow the right approach in future. However, one needs to mention here that the Left parties have also consistently followed an ideological path but their influence and acceptance has all along been concentrated to three States, namely West Bengal, Kerala and Tripura.

However, it needs to be pointed out that the Congress has to invent a new imagination, a new India of ideas which is civilisational and relevant to present day needs. It cannot be just another opposition but a dream of an alternative India. This demands a ground-level approach and a hard amount of radical intellectual thinking going beyond the unnecessary of Right and Left. The party has to aggregate new pluralism of various segments -- peasant, farmers, tribe, elderly, youth, unemployed and the exploited teacher, the obsolescent technologist -- into a coherent holism, not into a mechanical grid of patriotism and nationalism that is being evident presently.

The most important aspect in this regard is adhering to decentralisation, which was advocated by none other than Mahatma Gandhi long ago. It was the Congress which brought the 73 and 74 amendments empowering the panchayats and it is now time to give more power to these and ensure proper economic decentralisation. Moreover, there is need to involve the masses in the decision-making process at the grass root levels so that their requirements are not dictated from above. The Congress, in keeping with Gandhi's philosophy, needs to come up with ideas and values of the ashram which complements the policy thinking of think tanks and use it for formulating the right developmental strategy.

If proper emphasis is given to the rural sector - specially to agricultural development and promotion of cottage and small industries at the block levels, then the face of the villages may improve, providing employment opportunities to the rural youth. Though the Congress has been accused of urban bias in Indian planning, it is time that now this trend would be reversed in greater interest. There is the example of China, which concentrated on development of rural infrastructure for rapid growth of the country.

Finally, keeping in view the right priorities of development at this juncture, in the New Year the Congress has to follow the left of the centre stance in policy-making and development concerns to ensure that the poor and the weaker sections get an opportunity to improve their incomes and lifestyles. If necessary, collaboration with the Leftist parties in welfare matters would not be a bad idea till the scenario improves. This has to be the cornerstone of the party in the future, if it is successful in the coming Lok Sabha elections. -- INFA"

Delhi's oldest Ghazipur landfill and Asia's largest dumping ground - Deonar in Mumbai, continued to gather waste despite the Supreme Court ordering a closure of these landfills. Meanwhile, Delhi's biggest garbage dump- Bhalswa landfill caught fire that took three days to douse. Recently, Mumbai's second largest dumping ground - Mulund landfill was permanently closed after it reached its saturation point and then there was the fire at Ahmedabad's sole landfill site at pirana, where fumes emitting from garbage are a common sight for passersby.

While landfills continue to be an eyesore in the urban landscape and a crisis that most cities are grappling with, there were a few notable exceptions - Indore, and Ambikapur that declared themselves landfill free and emerged as benchmarks that others can follow.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015-2016 which have the last collated figures on the implementation of Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, over 1.3 lakh (1,35,198.27) tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in India. Of the total waste generated, while over one lakh tonnes per day (1,11,027.55 TPD) is collected, only a fraction - 25,572.25 TPD is treated and 47,415.62 TPD is landfilled.

To make sure cities go waste free, government also introduced seven star-rating under Swachh Survekshan - a pan India exercise to assess cleanliness in urban India. The seven star rating is the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India, designed on a SMART approach that stands for Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes. The criteria to achieve seven star rating is 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, 100 per cent waste treatment and waste free local water bodies.

The Current Status: The national capital Delhi is home to three of the biggest landfills namely Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa, which have out lived their life and are now unable to take the burden and collapsing under the weight of the waste. A fact that is borne out by the recent events with the Ghazipur dump yard collapsing in 2017, claiming two lives and Bhalswa and Okhla landfill smouldering continuously. The sad part is, despite all this, little to nothing has been done in 2018 to improve the status of landfills with 60-70 metre high mountain of garbage.

All kinds of waste that is wet, dry and toxic is collected together and dumped at a landfill. Once wet waste starts rotting and decomposing then you have formation of methane gas which is not only a toxic greenhouse gas, but flammable also. Because of the same, landfills are always under fire. It is just sometimes it is huge and someone passing sees it, makes a video and posts it on social media and it becomes news, says Chitra Mukherjee, Head of Programmes, Operations, Chintan.

""In Delhi, till date, about 10,500 tonnes of waste is collected per day. 6,100 TPD still goes to waste to energy plant and this is all mixed waste. Only 200 TPD gets composted"", says Swati Singh Sambyal, Programme Manager, Waste Management, Center for Science and Environment.

The Problem: Currently, a portion of collected waste is dumped at some or the other landfill and remaining is treated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants at Sarojini Nagar, Narela-Bawana, Ghazipur and Okhla. But are these WTE plants effective? Will they solve the problem?

Municipalities keep talking about WTE plants, but honestly they are pathetic, because all kinds of waste goes into it and is burned. WTE plants are neither meeting emission norms, nor helping in waste segregation and then recycling, says Chitra.

The problem in Delhi is lack of accountability and enforcement of Solid Waste Management Rules (SWMR) of 2016. It has been two years and not even single law has been implemented so far, reason being, as East Delhi Municipal Corporation says, lack of funds to provide vehicles and other necessary things to waste pickers. As part of SWMR, waste should be segregated at source and if not then defaulters will be penalised, but according to experts, not even single case has been registered.

Segregation of waste at source ensures that biodegradable waste like kitchen waste is composted, waste like plastic that can be recycled is sent to relevant facilities and only what remains make it way to the landfill. Unlike now where bulk of the waste is piling up at these landfills.

The Solution: To deal with the humoungous amount of waste, earlier this year Supreme Court asked Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to form a committee and come up with solutions. A 24 member team comprising children, civil society members, RWA (Resident Welfare Association) representatives, municipalities and others was formed and the committee is expected to submit its report in the first week of 2019.

Also Read: Despite New Waste Management Rules, Delhi's Ghazipur Landfill Grows 15 Metres In A Year

The committee is of the opinion that effective enforcement of SWMR of 2016 will help in managing the waste and making municipalities accountable. Being a member of the committee, Chitra knows the on ground issues and says,

The problem is citizens do not connect their responsibility with the landfill. Lot of people complain that we segregate waste at home, but waste pickers mix it. So, who is at fault? Of course, the municipalities as they do not have a dedicated stream for segregated waste.

For remediation that is to stop the environmental damage being caused by Bhalswa landfill, lifespan which lapsed in 2009 and yet it continues to be in use a decade later, a nine member Scientific Advisory Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. Manoj Dutta, Professor, IIT Delhi. According to the committee's recommendation, adoption of landfill mining (process of excavating landfilled solid wastes and processing it) is not a viable option. In the first stage, the committee has asked the municipal corporation to carry out site characterisation under which it needs to collect data on the quantum of waste under and above the ground, type and quality of waste, and other parameters for assessing the current state of the landfill. Once it is done, the nine member committee will prepare the design of the work to be done at the Bhalswa landfill site. While the investigation and design of the project is under progress, execution of plan is scheduled for March 31, 2020 which is still one and a half years from now. If that works well, similar steps can be taken for Ghazipur and Okhla landfill, maybe.

The Experts Opinion: Talking about the steps taken in 2018 and the way forward to deal with active volcanos in the city, Chitra says,

Nothing has happened in 2018, apart from passing the buck. With the committee submitting its report to the apex court, we hope municipalities to take some action in 2019, implement waste segregation, and especially SWMR.

The Current Status: Maharashtra's capital Mumbai is a densely populated city that generates 7,000 metric tonnes of waste per day that directly goes to two dumpyards - Deonar (holding city's waste from over 9 decades) and Mulund and to scientific landfill - Kanjurmarg. After observing the condition of the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds and noting how they have reached their saturation points, in February 2016, the Bombay High Court had ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to close down the two dumping grounds. It is in October this year that Mulund dumping ground was finally closed permanently, but Deonar continues to function way past its lifespan.

There is no such saturation point for landfills. As far as Deonar is concerned, there is still some space as we have started processing waste and have more plans to manage the waste effectively in the days to come, says BMC official.

While bio-mining and capping (a containment technology that forms a barrier between the waste and the ground, shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents) is being practised at Mulund landfill, bio-reactor (under which liquids are added to help bacteria break down the waste) and composting has been adopted at Kanjurmarg. But the question is, are these solutions sufficient and effective?

The BMC's Opinion: ""The process of bio-reactor is useful for mixed waste as well, so the good thing here is we don't have to pay heed to waste segregation. But it is not that we are ignoring waste segregation at source"", says BMC official.

With increase in waste load, BMC plans to increase the processing of waste at Kanjumarg by March end. The plan is to treat upto 5,800-6,000 metric tonnes of waste at Kanjurmarg and leave only 1000-1200 metric tonnes per day at Deonar.

While 5,000 tonnes will be treated via bio-reactor, 1,000 tonnes will be composted. We are strengthening the segregation activity which will further reduce the total generation and load on Deonar, says BMC official.

The Problem: Until October, of all the waste generated, 1400-1500 metric tonnes was dumped at Mulund dumping ground, every day. Now the same waste is being shared by Deonar and Kanjurmarg landfill, increasing the waste burden on already overstretched landfills. Deonar which expired back in 2009 is still being used recklessly and the result is constant fumes emerging from garbage, leading to instances of fires.

Though BMC has plans to treat waste on a daily basis, but what comes up as a major problem is the legacy waste. Lack of waste segregation at source comes up as another issue as without segregation the amount of waste reaching the landfills cannot be reduced.

The Solution: As experts say, decentralised process and segregation is the key to manage the mammoth waste and BMC is currently focusing on segregation. Shedding light on the same, BMC official says,

We have floated the tender, asking for vehicles with compartments to collect the segregated waste. 40 per cent of the requested vehicles are already in action and the remaining will be up soon. This will of course ease the entire process as dry waste will further get segregated into e-waste, plastic, paper, and others and treated accordingly.

Steps Taken By BMC In 2018: BMC has made it mandatory for bulk generators to treat wet waste at source. The ones failing to do so will be penalised as per the law. For residents and small scale waste generators, awareness camps, exhibitions and activities are being organised. People are being educated about the process of wet waste management at home and encouraged to practice the same.

Until and unless waste generators take the responsibility, we cannot do much. If at home you will segregate the waste, it will be easy for us to treat it as centralised processing centers cannot segregate the 7000 tonnes of waste. It has to start from your own home, building, society and colonies, says BMC official.

The Experts Opinion: ""I agree that waste generators need to take action, but decentralised process is pivotal. Like authority cannot lie in an individual's hand, entire waste cannot be managed in one way. Different kinds of waste need to be treated in different way and for the same we need different strategies"", says Chitra.

Earlier in 2013-2014, the waste load on dumping ground in Mumbai used to be 9,400 tonnes which has now come down to 7,000 tonnes and BMC further plans to bring it down to 6,000 tonnes. Can this be achieved? Given the scale of the crisis, the city sure will have its fingers crossed.

Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, is infamous for its garbage crisis and holds the title of 'garbage city of India'. A city with a population of 1.23 crore generates 4,000 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The waste is majorly categorised into dry, wet and sanitary waste. While the dry waste is collected and taken to 164 dry waste collection centers, wet waste is sent to eight processing units, together capable of treating 2,300 tonnes per day and sanitary waste is being treated by a private company.

Along with this, we have organic waste converter (treatment and recycling of solid and liquid refuse material) of capacity 1500 tonnes. 30 per cent of apartments in the city are doing composting on site. Also, we have a learning center where we give lessons on how to do composting, manage waste and other things. Main aim is to encourage waste segregation at source, Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

As far as mixed waste is concerned, it is simply dumped at scientific landfill - Bellahalli in the city, which came into existence around three years ago. In November, the orders were given to close Bellahalli landfill within 90 days, but civic body has decided to use the landfill for six more months and then convert it into a motor racing track. As part of the functioning of scientific landfill, currently, at frequent intervals, waste is covered with a thick layer of mud.

Earlier the city of Bengaluru was known as the garbage city, but today we are proud to say that this tag does not belong to us, Sarfaraz Khan.

The reason Mr Khan proudly says this is how in past a quarry turned into landfill was transformed into a beautiful park. Few years ago, the stone quarry at Bagalur was abandoned, after which it had become a dangerous spot due to the 200 feet deep pit. Slowly and gradually, the site turned into a dumping ground, raising concerns among villagers. It is three years ago, BBMP noticed the site and claimed it for a scientific landfill site. The scientific landfill would intake 300-400 tonnes of mixed waste everyday. After every 8 - 10 feet of garbage, 8 feet of mud capping was given. This way, by August 2017, quarry was filled and saplings of neem and amla and flowering plants like crotons were planted on it.

BBMP has done a lot in 2018 to improve waste management in the city. There is a new 'Swachagraha Kalika Kendra', a composting learning center for home and community, Bengaluru is the only city to collect sanitary waste separately, black spots are being cleaned. A lot has been done, but there is still a long way to go. We have infrastructure and policies, but what is lacking is the implementation and streamlined waste collection system. I feel citizens working with officials and elected representatives makes a good combination and together they can solve the crisis, says Nalini, co-founder, Hasiru Dala.

Madhya Pradesh's Indore has managed to grab the title of India's cleanest city for two years in a row. To maintain the lead in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as well, the city took some stringent steps this year with regards to waste management. From implementing 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, scientific land filling, to eliminating decade old waste from landfills, the city has done it all. It is not just focusing on treating household waste, but plastic and construction and demolition waste management as well.

Indore city generate 1100 metric tonnes of waste per day and we cannot leave this enormous amount of waste just like that. To manage the waste, a decentralised waste treatment system exists at each and every hospital, school, RWA, and other such places which make waste treatment possible at source only. The waste which is not treated goes to centralised waste treatment system handled by IMC and there it is taken care of, says Asad Warsi, Swachh Bharat Mission Consultant.

20 metric tonnes of waste generated in fruit and vegetable mandi (market) is used to power its public transport buses. A bio-mechanisation plant is installed in the market which ends up generating three types of gases from the waste generated in the fruit and vegetable market - Methane, Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Methane is separated, cleaned, purified and compressed and then converted into bio CNG which can fuel 20-25 buses every day.

Can waste generate wealth? Yes, as ambikapur proves it by earning lakhs. Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur has a population of 1.45 lakh and generates 52 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis, but instead of dumping it on some or the other dumpyard, the city converts waste into wealth and makes Rs. 20-25 lakh per month.

In the year 2015, the municipal corporation made it compulsory for citizens to segregate the waste at source. Since then, every morning, 447 sanitation workers go out, collect the segregated waste which is further segregated at 17 secondary segregation centres within the city. The segregated waste is then sent for recycling, composting and other kinds of processing, depending on the of waste.

Because of the same, the city was awarded as one of India's best city in 'Innovation and Best Practices' (population 1 - 3 lakh) category in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

The state of Chhattisgarh, which got third rank in Swachh Survekshan 2018, is on the way of following Ambikapur's zero waste model to become India's first zero-landfill state. If Ambikapur can do it, other cities of Chhattisgarh can think of doing it, then why not rest of India?, says Suryakiran Tiwari Agarwal, Municipal Commissioner of Ambikapur.

The success story of Indore, Ambikapur, and especially Kerala's Alappuzha which was even recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme for being exceptional in addressing the garbage crisis, show that managing waste effectively is possible. Decentralised system with segregation at source is a viable option and the way forward, according to experts."

The tech giant will be using data from the Union Ministry of Water Resources and sophisticated machine learning techniques to send alerts to people in simple text format.

During the pilot project, Google had sent a set of warnings in September, focusing on areas of Patna adjacent to the Ghaghara river. Now, Google will be extending the alert system ahead of the monsoon season to cover various areas of the country which contributes to 20 per cent of flood-related casualties globally.

Google had partnered with the Central Water Commission in India. Google though a map, Public Alerts, included areas labelled as 'low risk', 'medium risk' and 'high risk'. Patna was selected for the pilot because of the large population and frequent severe riverine floods.

Google, using an operational hydro-dynamic model, aims to prepare the ground to blend Machine Learning (ML) models in the process. Individuals in the area received an alert in the form of Android notifications and forms of maps.

New technologies like the light detection and ranging (LDAR), Transient Inundation Model for Rivers 2-Dimensional (TRIMR2D) and spatial analysis software (GIS) were used to create the flood forecast maps.

Despite various factors like relying on human calibration in current methodology, limited data on specific locations and difficulty in computing building continent levels, the forecasting of the riverine floods at scale is considered to be accurate.

According to a Union Ministry for Water Resources official, the Government is hoping the collaboration will help in the efforts of flood management. ""The initiative (with Google) could assist crisis management agencies to deal with extreme hydrological events in a better manner,"" the official said."

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Advertising

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

As eminent authors have been raising concern over the waning practice of writing in the mother tongue, the 32nd Guwahati Book Fair here has turned into a confluence of young writers writing in various Indian languages as well as English from all over the country during a two-day young writers' conclave organized by Sahitya Akademi and Publication Board, Assam on Saturday. The conclave was titled All India Young Writers' Meet. Secretary of the Sahitya Akademi, K Sreenivasarao, extended warm welcome to the young writers, especially promising to promote the native, recognized Indian languages.

""All Indian languages are under threat. However big they may look, society is changing internally so fast that our mother tongues are coming under threat. One of the main reasons for this is that we have drastically given up school education in our mother tongues,"" said Borah, delivering the inaugural address of the meet.

Recollecting the contributions of brilliant minds writing in mother tongues from the past, he added, ""Over the last 30-40 years, the Indian middle class and the elite of the society have shifted focus from mother tongues to English. This is affecting not only big languages, the threat is huge in case of languages spoken by lesser populations. Some of them have already lost their languages.""

The eminent writer, who is also the convener of Sahitya Akademi's Assamese advisory board, said languages like Bengali, Marathi, Malayalam or Telugu, which are spoken by a large populace, the shift of a small section of students from the mother tongue may not have a big impact, but a similar shift will have a huge impact for the vernacular languages spoken by smaller populations.

""Many of our young writers don't want to write in their mother tongues, but the most important thing is that we have to uphold the right of our own language and know how to express in our own language,"" said Borah.

While stating that learning English is vital for higher scientific education and livelihood, he said people must build up their own language and literature in the cultural sphere.

He also expressed happiness that most writers attending the conclave write in their own mother tongue and are ""rooted in the world and society where they are living."""

Pakistan ends 2018 with a sharply devalued rupee, greater dependence on foreign largesse, lower credit rating, and even less democracy than before.

The year witnessed the imprisonment of a former prime minister and the selection of a new one - Imran Khan - hailed as the country's saviour by some and seen as an inexperienced and dimwitted demagogue by others.

The turbulence in Pakistan's politics began well before 2018 and will probably continue for years to come. But this was the year when the all-powerful military stopped pretending that elected civilians run the country's affairs.

Everybody knows that the military has been Pakistan's most powerful institution since 1951. But after the collapse of the military regime headed by General Pervez Musharraf in 2008, it was assumed that the generals had learnt their lesson. Instead of assuming power directly, they seemed willing to share responsibility for running the country with elected politicians.

Also read: Pakistani military establishment shouldn't have put all their eggs in Imran Khan's basket

The politicians pushed for greater control over policy-making in the last decade. The 18 amendment to Pakistan's constitution enhanced the authority of the provinces, giving them greater control over economic resources.

There was deference to the military's concerns in foreign policy and matters pertaining to national security. But the two generals succeeding Musharraf as chief of army staff went to great lengths to keep up appearances of constitutional governance and civilian rule. Many around the world bought into the idea of gradual democratisation of Pakistan.

All that changed once the current army chief, General Qamar Bajwa, threw down the gauntlet to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Bajwa was not content with a personality cult for himself, like the one General Raheel Sharif had built. Nor did he focus solely on getting an extension in his three-year tenure, as General Ashfaq Kayani had preferred, although he still has another year in office and might seek that coveted extension.

Bajwa's approach has been to virtually take over the civilian apparatus of state and to run the country, not from parliament or the presidency, but from General Headquarters (GHQ.)

""The military and the civilian government are on one page"" is the new mantra in Pakistan.

The courts, especially the Supreme Court headed by Justice Saqib Nisar, seems to give judgments dictated by the military and any judge who does not toe the line is sidelined or removed. The media is tightly controlled and the general heading Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) is the virtual czar over the flow of information to Pakistan's citizens.

After installing Imran Khan as the Prime Minister through an election that did not offer a level playing field to his rivals, the military has reverted Pakistan to where it was before the 2008 election that resulted in Musharraf's removal from office. It is interesting that many of Khan's ministers and close advisers are all individuals who held government positions under Musharraf.

From the generals' point of view, things could not be better. They have an ostensibly civilian government in place, which can get the blame for Pakistan's myriad problems, while the generals run the government. Who needs the title of president or chief martial law administrator (CMLA) when you can act as a ventriloquist and get the president, prime minister, and cabinet ministers to say and do exactly what you want?

The Pakistani military, like all militaries, is motivated by patriotism and its plan for effectively remaining in charge stems from several wrong assumptions. It assumes that diverse opinions and policy prescriptions are damaging for Pakistan; that politicians and independent thinking civilians are untrustworthy and lacking in national spirit; and that learning from the past means determining whom to blame rather than figuring out what those mistakes might have been.

That is why there has been a remarkable consistency in the core beliefs and thoughts of Pakistan's top military commanders.

General Bajwa ended the year with the proclamation that Pakistan was the target of ""a hybrid campaign"", in which ""our own people"" are major protagonists.

""Mostly misguided by ambitions, blinded by hate, ethnicity or religion or simply overawed by social media onslaught, some of our own boys and girls readily fall victim to such dangerous or hostile narratives,"" he declared, implying that having a single narrative was all that was needed to protect Pakistan.

This way of thinking assumes that the normal exchange of ideas in a democracy is undesirable and is not unique to Bajwa. Pakistan's first military ruler, Field Marshal Ayub Khan, spoke in a similar vein and most army chiefs since then have insisted on shutting down debate about what really ails Pakistan.

While the military leadership waged war against alternative narratives, Pakistan was put on the grey list of the UN's Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that deals with money laundering and terrorist financing. Pakistan also ended up on the United States' 'countries of concern' list in relation to religious freedom.

Dealing with internationally designated terrorist groups or protecting religious minorities simply do not feature among concerns of those who rule Pakistan, even if Imran Khan says it does. The country's low ranking in most international indicators - its low literacy (which fell by 2 per cent over the last four years) and poor human capital - also are issues that get little mention and even less attention in the national discourse.

In international relations, deteriorating ties with the United States and India were put down to those countries' arrogance. In the view from Islamabad, there is smugness about the 'all-weather friendship' with China coupled with the assumption that Pakistan's strategic location makes it so important that some combination of powers would always be available as the country's allies.

But the state of the economy is definitely a cause for anxiety. 2018 ended with the State Bank of Pakistan lowering its forecast for economic growth from 5.8 per cent to 4 per cent. The Pakistan rupee went through considerable devaluation during the year, foreign exchange reserves declined to precarious levels, and the stock market did not have a good year.

Also read: Imran Khan says can't have Pakistan treated like a 'hired gun'

Pakistan found itself at the doorstep of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for its 13bailout since the 1980s, with most analysts predicting that it would come with tough conditions.

Khan approached Pakistan's few remaining friends in the international community -China, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - for loans and deposits to stave off a budgetary and foreign-exchange crisis.

The Saudis promised $3 billion in the form of a deposit with the State Bank, of which $1 billion has been a delivered. The UAE promised another $3 billion deposit with the central bank. Saudi Arabia also announced that Pakistan would be allowed to defer payments on $3 billion of oil purchases for one year to preserve foreign exchange reserves. Negotiations with China for additional funds continued through the end of the year.

The Saudi and UAE deposits in the State Bank are short-term loans and at the end of the day, Pakistan needs to expand exports and increase remittances from overseas Pakistanis. There is no sign that exports would rise without a restructuring of the economy and growth in remittances was also flat.

There was no understanding among the men who rule Pakistan that economic performance is often linked to political stability and predictability as well as all the other things -like higher literacy, quality of education, human capital, openness to new ideas, social trust, ease of travel - that they do not wish to discuss.

With judicial manipulation, election interference, jailing and enforced disappearances of opponents, and a clampdown on the media, Pakistan's military feels it has created unity of command in 2018 without a military coup. The generals and civilian ministers are said to be on the same page.

In 2019, we will find out whether the writing on that page will lead to a better outcome for Pakistan and Pakistanis than has been their fate for the several decades of military ascendancy.

Tech giant Google is scaling up its learnings from a pilot project in Patna to provide flood alerts in simple text format to people in many parts of the country using sophisticated machine learning techniques. The Union Ministry of Water Resources provides Google with data on river water levels for preparing such public alerts.

A month after the devastating Kerala floods, Google sent out a set of flood-warning alerts early September as part of the pilot project in eastern India. While these alerts focused on areas around Patna abutting the Ghaghara River, the California-based company is now scaling it up ahead of the monsoon season to cover many more parts of the country. India accounts for 20 per cent of flood-related fatalities globally.

In the pilot, implemented in partnership with the Central Water Commission in India, Google showed, via Public Alerts, a map that included areas designated as 'high risk' 'medium risk' and 'low risk'. The pilot used an operational hydro-dynamic model, with the explicit goal of preparing the ground for integrating Machine Learning (ML) models into the process. Alerts were then sent out to individuals in the catchment area in the form of maps and Android notifications.

Patna was chosen for the pilot given its large population and one of the most frequent occurrences of severe riverine flooding. ""After we sent out the alerts, this allowed us to look into how people experience and interact with the alerts we send. We've realised that many people prefer text that describes the same information our maps show,"" Sella Nevo from Google's Research and Machine Intelligence team said. ""This allowed us to be relatively confident that our pilot will also be informative as we prepare to scale our efforts up... Our alerts, though limited in scope for our first pilot, achieved results we're happy with,"" Nevo said.

There are a number of new technologies and methods for the creation of flood forecast maps. For example, 'LDAR' (light detection and ranging) technology, which has the ability to get accurate elevations throughout the floodplain quickly and affordably, and TRIMR2D (Transient Inundation Model for Rivers 2 Dimensional), a numerical computer program, that can simulate flood flows across the floodplain and several miles downstream from the forecast point. Then, there is a spatial analysis software (GIS) that turns the model results into maps and overlays them on other maps, like a map of a locality, or even onto an aerial shot.

Effective riverine flood forecasting at scale, though, is hindered by a number of factors, such as the need to rely on human calibration in current methodology, the limited amount of data for a specific location, and the computational difficulty of building continent level models that are sufficiently accurate.

A Union Ministry for Water Resources official said the Government hopes the collaboration with Google will help in flood management efforts. ""The initiative (with Google) could assist crisis management agencies to deal with extreme hydrological events in a better manner,"" the official said. Google says its ML-based modeling provides a wide range of improvements over the traditional physics-based models. ML is primed to be advantageous in this scenario, with some models often exceeding human experts in complex high-dimensional scenarios, and the framework of transfer or multitask learning is an appealing solution for leveraging local signals to achieve improved global performance.""

""First, it can enable incorporating additional types of data, details and nuances, that are either neglected by physics-based models or modeled inaccurately. Second, it enables much more efficient models, critical for scaling this effort across India and eventually globally. Finally, it enables automating many of the processes that need to be implemented manually using existing methods - which drastically reduces costs and allows us to scale,"" Nevo said.

In September last year, during the Kerala floods, a joint team of researchers from the Michigan Technological University and University of Kerala had come out with an inundation map using satellite images and data from the European Space Agency's radar satellite Sentinel to map the inundated areas in Kerala during and following the floods. The team followed up the mapping with a field visit to validate the data."

Provision of schools does not guarantee the availability of necessary facilities in schools. The gap is still wide when compared to the enrolment of children in the school and learning outcome.

Captain Indraani Singh, Founder, and CEO, Literacy India talks about online education in India, technological advancements and Literacy India helping out students with the educational program.

How can online education transform the Indian education sector?

Education in India is a dire need to help reduce unemployment and increase economic activity in the country. The setting up of physical schools is a time taking and expensive process, thereby slowing down the pace of eradicating education gap. While online education helps to reach more students in the least amount of time and is not expensive either. Therefore, online education can increase the speed of education in our country where digitization is spreading rapidly as well.

Besides, online learning enables students to engage with the subject matter, interact with course videos and learn at their own pace, which also reduces dropouts as its more engaging, interesting and makes students more familiar with using computers. On the other hand, it allows teachers to assign, monitor and evaluate coursework remotely, apart from highlighting the areas of students which need improvement.

How does Literacy India help drop-out students in the transition to education?

Literacy India's technology-enabled remedial education program Gyantantra Udbhav has helped mainstream thousands of drop-out students. The program essentially enables these drop-out students who do not respond well to the confines of traditional classrooms and experience lack of access to education. The education program combines practical, intellectual and social attributes to create composite learning modules to help students complete school curriculum till Class 5. Embedded with an interactive multimedia interface, the modules are designed with a systematic instructional approach that makes learning fun, even for those who lack basic reading and writing skills. The tool tracks minimum levels of learning based on assessments and outcomes. Once students complete the program, they are eligible to join any other government school.

How AI is being used in the system?

Gyantantra Udbhav is an interactive multimedia interface, which includes modules designed with a systematic instructional approach that makes learning fun, even for those who lack basic reading and writing skills. The tool tracks minimum levels of learning based on assessments and outcomes. It leverages gaming technology embedded with cartoon characters thereby ensuring effective retention of the information. As such the program is customized to bridge the learning gap which is of common existence among this set of children, who either are out-of-school or in-school children faltering on fundamental concepts. Understandably, technology and innovation with its various verticals such as IoT and AI have the ability to ably support the education mediums and increase efficiency and productivity of those involved like these children. Thus, it is with the integration of such new age technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning or virtual reality that the learning experience will be more interactive and personalized thereby enhancing and improving access to education and learning.

Can technology improve engagement and result in better learning outcomes?

The most obvious benefit of technology run education is that it is subjective to the learner's ability and level. Through virtual interactive engagement, it teaches students with different speeds depending on their backgrounds and more importantly different starting points. Also, technological education platform is cost-effective and time-efficient and is flexible to the needs of every single student -- be it on-the-go, class of one, on-demand, gamified or crowdsourced.

How can online education impact India's education and development landscape?

Education is an important part of a country's growth and development. It is not only about employment but also empowerment. Education serves as the front-runner in transforming the society, economy, and polity for better. Accompanied with technological advancements, that is online education, is then a game changer for a nation like India, which has an enormous population, with approximately 28 percent of children in the age group 0-14. Gyantantra program has been conceived to meet these very needs of the country, that is mass education and creating awareness about social and economic identity in a world marked by technological innovation. Ultimately, the future of education is to converge into the India's new economy, which notably is fast on track to digitization. Online learning is then a natural step for the future generations and workforce in order to survive future technological disruptions."

The conviction of Nawaz Sharif in a second disproportionate assets case, and the seven year prison sentence handed down by the Accountability Court -- he was given 10 years in the first case but the sentence was temporarily suspended -- caps an annus horribilis for the former prime minister. The fresh sentence also brought, somewhat gratuitously, a 10-year disqualification, when the Supreme Court had already disqualified him for life. The fresh conviction can only impact Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (N) adversely. The party put up a good fight in the July parliamentary election but questions will now arise about who will lead it. Maryam Nawaz, his political heir, is also convicted and disqualified, and many of the party's other top rungers are embroiled in their own accountability cases or have been disqualified for one reason or another.

Sharif's travails, which began at a time when he and his Pakistan Muslim League (N) seemed all set to win another term in office, cannot be separated from Pakistan's own journey this year. From a democracy that was struggling to grow, it is one whose roots and branches will be clipped every now and then by the Army. It has all but come to terms with its bonsai reality. There was a time leaders like Benazir Bhutto and Sharif asserted their independence from the Pakistan military, even though Sharif owed his political career to it and the late PPP leader also seemed to make her peace with it. But now, none other than Prime Minister Imran Khan proudly declares that his government and the Pakistan Army are ""on the same page"". He may even agree with his critics that he owes his victory to the Army, and to an activist judiciary that cleared the way for him by knocking out his most important political rival. The cases against Sharif can hardly be described as watertight. In the second conviction, as in the first, the court placed the burden of proof on him.

As for Imran Khan, the learning curve has been steep. He and his finance minister, Asad Umar, are struggling with a severe balance of payments crisis, while the rupee was devalued yet again last month. Khan has had to make trips to Saudi Arabia, UAE and China. US President Donald Trump has continued to keep Pakistan on edge. India foolishly believes it punishes Pakistan by not talking to it. In fact, the years of non-engagement are one reason why India is struggling to find the right response to the Imran Khan government. If the flip-flop on foreign ministers' talks showed Delhi in bad light, the initiative on the Kartarpur corridor saw India straining to prove it was the one to make the proposal two decades ago. Movement in India-Pakistan relations must not be tied to elections in India. That would only reinforce a dangerous impression -- that India-Pakistan ties and communal relations in India are two sides of the same coin."

Vibrant and despairing, diverse and parochial, hyper-traditional and quick to change, rural India is more than the sum of its contradictions

Let There Be Light

Governments are generally bigger on promises than on delivery. On rural electrification, though, PM Narendra Modi has been keen to trumpet his achievements. Modi promised that 18,452 villages that were yet to be 'electrified', out of India's 600,000 villages, would be connected to the grid in 1,000 days. On April 28 this year, he announced that the target had been achieved. Leisang, in Manipur, was the last place in the country to officially receive electricity, ""a historic day in the development journey of India"", as the prime minister tweeted. But there appears to be a difference between being 'electrified' and actually having access to electricity. Recent studies by academics show that power supply and billing in rural areas are significant hurdles, so while households are connected, are they necessarily availing the benefits of having electricity? As the photograph suggests, solar-generated power is crucial to India's commitment to clean energy. Despite solar power being cheaper than its coal-generated equivalent, and despite the rapid increase in India's solar capacity, it is still too small-scale to meet demand.

Battle for Ambedkar

Dr B.R. Ambedkar has always been a celebrated figure, the country's first law minister and architect of the Constitution. But appreciation of his legacy has become a curiously political enterprise of late. Dalits are increasingly an important aspect of the BJP's political calculations, and part of the party's outreach has been for the prime minister to talk up his personal veneration for Ambedkar. Opening a memorial for Ambedkar in April, Narendra Modi claimed that other governments (read Congress-led ones) had paid lip service to Ambedkar while doing nothing to shore up his legacy. BJP leaders, including the likes of party president Amit Shah, have made it a point to be photographed showing obeisance to Ambedkar, but is it helping the party retain the votes it won so comprehensively in 2014? Signs, particularly in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are not encouraging, with SC votes in the rural heartlands swinging comprehensively towards the Congress.

Fragile Threads

India's traditional textiles have been treasured by people across the globe for centuries. They brought traders and invaders to our shores and may have spun the competitive engines of the industrial revolution which would later all but vanquish them. Today, powerlooms provide some 70 per cent of all Indian fabrics. Yet an astonishing diversity of handloom and handicraft fabrics survives in the Indian countryside, most of it produced by women weavers and embroiderers. While the state has played an important role in preserving these livelihoods-for example, by winning GI or Geographical Indication certification for the phulkari embroidery of Punjab-government policies can also endanger this fragile sector. The roughshod implementation of new GST rules proved a particular threat to the delicate economy of handloom weavers in small towns and villages.

Transports of Delight

The bail gaadi or bullock cart was perhaps the most persistent emblem of rural India-for a couple of thousand years. In the 20th century, the infernal combustion and horsepower of motorised transport made steady inroads into that romantic image. It's a transformation that has moved so fast that younger generations will probably view this image of a 'Tempo' taxi (right) in rural UP with nostalgia. The bhat-suwar, as it is fondly remembered in North India, along with its fellow travellers like the hand-made 'Marutas' of UP or 'vans' of Bengal, is now giving way to new models such as the chhota haathi (the Tata Ace), the Mahindra Jeeto or the Ashok Leyland Dost, as major corporations rediscover rural markets. Tata, for example, saw its rural sales expand by 38 per cent this year-almost twice its growth in urban markets.

Cock-fighting, popular around the country, is just as cruel, and arguably even more vicious than the bull-taming exercise, jallikattu. Both 'pastimes' are banned by the courts. But advocates have successfully argued that on some occasions, particularly on temple premises, cockfights ""held in the traditional manner"" should be permitted. The Hyderabad High Court, however, banned cockfights even during the Sankranti harvest festival in January, an order the SC upheld and led to the arrest of roosters. Yes, roosters.

Cries Over Spilled Milk

LAND OF MILK AND...Dairy farmers at a street protest in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)

Farmer anger has been a major story of recent years. And it's still building. Protests have been numerous and vociferous, with thousands marching through New Delhi just last month. Many analysts argue that agrarian distress contributed substantially to the BJP's damaging defeats in the five recent assembly elections. In the past two summers, farmers across the country threw their milk onto the streets in protest at falling prices. Farmers have been demanding greater subsidies to prop up their increasingly meagre earnings. Before milk was being thrown in the streets, it was vegetables and sugarcane. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau show an eight-fold increase in farmer protests between 2014 and 2016. Solutions beyond loan waivers and fiddling with minimum support prices are thin on the ground. Climate change and dwindling groundwater supplies mean the future holds little promise of a 'technological fix'. With a looming general election, politicians are likely to continue to offer financial quick fixes. But a serious conversation about an agrarian crisis that is claiming the lives of thousands of farmers each year is long overdue.

In 2004, though, over three billion barrels worth of oil was discovered to be lying under the sands, causing a sudden surge in excitement, and demand for such things as upmarket hotels and luxury cars. In October this year, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources, the mining company, agreed to a 10-year extension of its contract to produce oil from the Mangala area. Since 2013, Pachpadra, another village in Barmer, has been waiting for a refinery and the promise of wealth and jobs. In July, eight people were arrested for conspiring to steal 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Barmer fields and sell it on for Rs 25 per barrel. Nice work if you can get it?

In the Name of the Cow

RED MEAT: A lull in the fatal lynching of Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh, Jharkhand, June 2017. (Photo: Somnath Sen)

Conservative estimates suggest that some 30 people have now been killed by 'gau rakshaks' since 2014, the attackers apparently emboldened by government moves to penalise cow slaughter. Among those lynched was Alimuddin Ansari in Jharkhand last year. Eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime by a fast-track court in March. Out on bail, the men were warmly received by their local MP, a Union minister, at his official residence. Earlier this month, in Bulandshahr, an alleged case of cow slaughter led to riots in which a police inspector was shot in the head. As a result of the new wave of 'cow protection', many farmers, unable to feed cows that no longer give milk, have turned their animals loose. Government shelters, such as the one in the picture in Madhya Pradesh, are filled to capacity.

Healthcare on the Hoof

One of the more irritating cliches about India is that it is the land of jugaad, a land where everyone can fashion a bandage out of rags to staunch the bleeding, if only temporarily. And then along comes a picture like this and you have to acknowledge the cliches exist for a reason. For some years now, the government has made certain basic diagnostic tests free of charge. Drugs and diagnostic tests make up as much as 70 per cent of the costs that push millions of people below the poverty line in India each year. To get tests done, people have to go to their nearest clinics, though 'nearest' is a relative term in rural India. Vans were perhaps what they had in mind. But, for these patients in a village in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, a camel will do just as well.

The Maggi Index

India has had over two decades of solid economic growth. Disposable incomes have been rising, if faster in some places and for some people than others. And people all over the country, not just in the metropolitan centres, have access to and want a part of the consumer lifestyle. The scene in this photograph is an example of the spread of 'cityfied' lifestyles. The phenomenal popularity of Maggi in India has always been something of an oddity. The nutrition may be questionable, but Maggi became an urban staple. And perhaps, as a sign of the inexorable march of urbanisation and urban habits, a rural one too.

Business of Beauty

Economic growth may be robust, but jobs remain hard to come by. The government has suggested that self-employment might be the way of the future. This is, of course, a familiar experience for many Indians, particularly those who live in rural India. The great majority of Indians, urban and rural, work in the casual economy. The young beautician pictured here goes door to door, providing a valued service. The salon may be makeshift but the customer isn't complaining. And even the buffaloes seem to approve.

Road to Normalcy?

In April, the now ex-chief minister of Chhattisgarh boasted that the building of roads in the state had progressed to the extent that in ""districts like Bastar and Dantewada you can now go anywhere"". Later that same month, Maoist guerrillas killed 25 CRPF men guarding the highway linking Dantewada to the Sukma district. An extensive government plan is in place to connect some of India's most remote rural areas by road, to enable these villages to participate in countrywide development. Many of these villages are in Chhattisgarh, in the 'Red Corridor' plagued by running battles between the Maoists and security forces.

Reading, Writing and Terrible arithmetic

India's record in education is a deceptive image. Despite the gains made in achieving benchmarks of universal enrolment and better gender parity in primary education in the early 2000s, recent studies have revealed that the country is failing in secondary education. The ASER study in 2017 found that 57 per cent of 14- to 18-year-olds can't solve basic division problems and a government survey in 2014 concluded that only 16 per cent of Class X students could correctly answer more than half the mathematics questions put to them. Rural students from disadvantaged communities risk higher dropout rates and poorer learning. It doesn't help that government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell from 3.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 2.6 per cent in 2016-17.

The Ghost Villages

While migration from the countryside to the cities is an ancient and universal story, it has reached stark proportions in some parts of the country. In the foothills of Uttarakhand, in particular, the phenomenon has begun to spook even the state government, which in 2017 appointed a 'Migration Commission' to look into the proliferation of bhootiya or 'ghost' villages. The commission found that some 119,000 people had abandoned their homes and agriculture, leaving some 700 villages deserted. The village pictured here, once one of the wealthiest settlements in Kumaon, has been reduced to ruins by the loss of border trade and migration to towns better integrated into the economic mainstream."

Moderator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Q2 FY2019 Earnings Conference Call of Ashok Leyland hosted by Edelweiss Securities Limited. As a reminder, all participant lines will be in the listen-only mode and there will be an opportunity for you to ask questions after the presentation concludes. Should you need assistance during the conference call please signal operator by pressing ""*"" then ""0"" on your touchtone phone. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I now hand the conference over to Mr. Chirag Shah from Edelweiss Securities Limited. Thank you, and over to you, Sir. Chirag Shah: Thank you, Stanford and good evening, everyone. On behalf of Edelweiss Securities, I would like to welcome you all to Q2 FY2019 Post Results Conference Call of Ashok Leyland. Ashok Leyland is represented by Mr. Dheeraj Hinduja, Chairman; Mr. Vinod K. Dasari, Managing Director and CEO; and Mr. Gopal Mahadevan, President, Customer Solutions Business and CFO; along with other key members.

I would like to thank the management for giving us the opportunity to host the call and taking out time for the call. We will start the session with opening comments from the management, and then we can start with the Q&A. Over to you, Sir!

Gopal Mahadevan: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. Thank you very much for the interest in Ashok Leyland. I will just announce results very briefly. I'm sure all of you must have seen it on the web.

The total industry volume, and I am giving SIAM numbers. The total industry volume for the quarter was 101768 MHCVs that is trucks and buses put together, and this was a growth of 26% over the same quarter last year. So, the industry continued to grow over the same period last year.

Ashok Leyland grew faster than the industry. Our volumes were 35628 M&HCV, which was a 32% growth over last year. I also wanted to share with you that this quarter again, it is a record Q2 volumes, record Q2 revenues and record Q2 EBITDA and PAT.

Our market share in the truck business was 34.3%., bus was 42%. And overall, our market share as per SIAM was 35.0% as against 33.5% in Q2 of last year, which was an increase of 1.5%.

Overall, revenues were Rs.7608 Crores, which was 25% higher than Q2 last year. Our EBITDA was Rs.806 Crores, 10.6%, and that grew at 32% as against the 25% growth in revenues. Our PAT was Rs.460 Crores, which again grew at 38%. Our overall debt at the moment, we are cash positive of Rs.700 Crores.

I think with that brief introduction, I would now hand it over to our Chairman, Mr. Dheeraj.

Dheeraj G Hinduja: Good evening. Gopal has already announced the results, and I must say that given the challenges of the heavy discounting and increasing raw material prices, the continued double-digit EBITDA in 14 of the 15 sequential quarters exemplifies the operational efficiency drive of the company.

The growth and market share in Q2 also endorse the reach of our ever-growing network. I must compliment the team for its continued pursuit of disruptive innovation. The Innoline BS IV engine holds tremendous potential as it reduces operational costs significantly. It is the only BS IV engine with a manual pump.

The team is continually looking at driving operating leverage despite the challenging times, and our plans and tasks are clearly cut for the way forward. The current times are no doubt challenging: Higher oil prices; depreciating rupee; the tightening of the NBFC sector, which is critical to our industry; the uncertainty in economic and political environments as well. But these are transient challenges, and we should not take our eyes off from our larger purpose.

My direction to the team has been that while we will need to counter the short-term challenges, we need to pursue our larger journey of de-volatising Ashok Leyland, drive international revenues, increase new-generation business and work on people, processes and operational efficiency. We will continue to invest in innovation and technology as that is in the grain of Ashok Leyland.

As you must all be aware by now, Mr. Vinod Dasari, our Managing Director and CEO, after a stint of 14 years at Ashok Leyland and 7 years as the Managing Director, has decided to move on and pursue other interests. Together with Vinod and the leadership team, we have transformed Ashok Leyland into a forceful commercial vehicle company today. The strong leadership team today drives the innovation, strategies and operations of the company.

I must acknowledge Vinod's contribution in this transformation and the cultural change that he has enforced into the company. I would like to wish him the very best.

Vinod is here till March 31, 2019, and I will also, on the request of the board, be playing a more active role as an Executive Chairman and on key issues along with Vinod, provide the necessary support during this transition. All organizations go through this transition, and Ashok Leyland is no exception. I believe and, one of the questions you would obviously be having, but the Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the board will meet shortly to decide the future course of action in identifying the next MD and CEO.

I would like to now hand over to Mr. Vinod Dasari.

Vinod K. Dasari: Good afternoon, everybody. As Chairman has already pointed out, this was an important announcement that was made at Ashok Leyland today. I wanted to state that this was not a decision that was made as a knee-jerk reaction to some issue. There is absolutely no issue. In fact, people often try to find times in their career when they are looking to pursue new or interesting learning's, but there has never a good time. I had considered this about 6 or 7 years ago, but the company was not doing well. And at that point, I did not want to leave. I wanted to make sure the company was transformed well, and we took a company that was not doing so, well, and we made it into one of the best-performing automobile companies in the world. I had a solid team doing that with me. And when our team was together, we decided that look we made it into a good company. And if we do not continue the path at which we have created, we will again decline. So, we should lay down a platform to make it into a great company.

And for that, the team worked very hard to put in a solid platform. We have three sets of businesses. One is the core business in which we have got world-class Euro 6 modular vehicles as well as electric vehicles coming. The adjacent businesses, LCV is doing extremely well. The defense is doing extremely well, and power solutions, is doing well. We have launched several frontier businesses: the electric vehicles business, the customer solutions business, the digital solutions that we are doing exceptionally well.

And I have a solid team backing this and an exceptional board and family support. So, I felt this is the right time to do it. Like I said, there is never a right time. But to do it when the company is in a very strong position and leaving it with a team, which is very, very capable. That is what helped me make the decision at this point.

That is all, I think, from our side. We will take questions now.

Moderator: Thank you. The first question is from the line of Binay Singh from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Binay Singh: Thanks for the opportunity. Best wishes to Mr. Dasari. The company has done quite well under your leadership across parameters. Good luck for the future. On to the business, the first question I would ask is about something on the demand side. In the opening comments, you talked about NBFC about sort of macro uncertainty. Could you talk a little bit about how the ground level demand environment is? How October has been, what sorts of inventory levels do you have currently? That is my first question.

Vinod K. Dasari: Thank you very much for your compliment. As far as the demand is concerned, in the last few weeks, there has been a little bit of a slowdown basically due to the credit crunch, but this is temporary. 40% to 45% of our volumes that we are getting in the industry today is driven by construction segment. It is not driven by market load segment. So, as a result, there is a delay, but it will catch up because infrastructure projects are going on and even if the market is flat for rest of the year, the overall growth for the year will be in the range of 15% to 20%. So, I am quite bullish. In the next year, we will have a Euro-VI prebuy. So, that is going to be extremely good. The year after is when the government is likely to announce the scrappage policy. Usually the market falls after that, but there is a scrappage policy that is coming up, which will help boost the demand. And equally, as I was mentioning in my earlier comments that our core business is transforming itself to produce vehicles from 2 tonnes all the way up to 65 tonnes, which will be Euro-VI compliant. It will be electric compliant. It will be modular, left-hand drive, right-hand drive. So, as a result, it will be a much bigger market that you can address, not just in India. So, in that sense, we are fairly bullish about it.

Binay Singh: Right. That is helpful. Could you talk a little bit more about the NBFC financing? Like, what percentage of your financing will be NBFC? And what percentage is coming from the in-house subsidiary?

Vinod K. Dasari: I think our internal subsidiary is less than 15%. We do not like any NBFC or any bank to have more than 15% share of business, So, that we spread. I also remember, you asked a question about inventory. I think it is about 7700 vehicles. It is quite balanced. Even with our dealers, we normally ask them to keep about 2 weeks of inventory and not more, and I think they are somewhere in the 16 to 18. It is not if the dealer has inventory, he would not push inventory into it.

Binay Singh: So, even the dealer inventory is 16 to 18 days, is that now...?

Vinod K. Dasari: Correct, correct. We normally keep 2 weeks because that's the transit time. Mainly because of Diwali and lack of drivers and all, it might have gone up by a couple of days, but we watch it very carefully, and we ensure that the dealer inventory does not spike.

Binay Singh: Just related to this question, with slight slowdown that you've seen, have you seen discounting rise in this environment?

Vinod K. Dasari: Discounting has been rampant, and there are some competitors who are clearly going after market share. We are not going to chase market share like that. We focus on the value that our vehicles provide, and we have increased prices in September. Some are not following the discounting level, or the operating prices continues to be low. But regardless, we have focused on the right segments and the right models, and that's why you see that our EBITDA margins have actually gone up. Plus, please keep in mind 3 years ago, our domestic truck sales used to be 80% to 85% of our total sales revenues. Now it is around 60%.

Binay Singh: Thanks a lot. I will come back in the queue.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jinesh Gandhi of Motilal Oswal Securities Limited. Please go ahead.

Jinesh Gandhi: Congrats to Mr. Dasari for a very strong career. My first question pertains to Mr. Hinduja. You indicated that you will be playing an active role. So, this executive role only during the transitory phase or this now you would be more active even when new CEO steps in?

Dheeraj G. Hinduja: No. I mean, just to clarify, you might have noticed our group companies also and as a family policy that family does not take access day-to-day involvement or executive roles in the company. In this instance, the board requested to ensure continuity during this transitionary phase for me to take on this role. So, this would be for that relative period till the new person is appointed, and I will be working with Vinod on the longer-term actions of the company. I think our main task is to ensure the continuity of the vision that we have, the targets that we have set and the growth that we have seen over the last few years. We wish to ensure that, that does not get dampened in any manner. We have a very strong team. Along with this, we also have a very strong goal. And I think the combination of this will ensure that what Vinod has put in place will continue.

Jinesh Gandhi: Understood. And second question pertains is on the financial side to Mr. Gopal. We have seen significant increase in RM cost and on the other side, there has been a substantial decline in other expenses as a percentage of sales. So, is there any accounting change? Or how do you explain that?

Gopal Mahadevan: No, the RM cost going up is a confluence of two, three factors. One is, Jinesh, as we mentioned, the industry has its challenge of increasing steel prices that all of you know of. And we possibly were the only players who have raised prices even consistently over Q1 and Q2. But the fact is that these prices, while they kind of reduce the impact of the increased raw material prices, they still reflect as a ratio. The raw material prices, as a percentage is higher. The second most important this is this quarter did not have any defence sales which has decent margin. I mean, there can be impact on the overall profitability as well as gross margin. So that is another reason why we have seen the material cost numbers slightly higher.

Jinesh Gandhi: Okay. And other expenses?

Gopal Mahadevan: Nothing significant that have to be explained. I mean, except that we have seen that there is a reduced warranty charge because the BS-III to BS-IV transition that happened. Now you are seeing that things are stabilizing, the iEGR engines are working well. So, we follow a warranty system accounting where we found that the numbers are really dampening. And we are also keeping a tight, strict control on overall expenditure also. So, those are the reasons for it and some of them, to be honest, I do not want to talk over it too much that could be timing, but larger directional issues on the other expenses are one, warranty, the second one is tight control on expenditure.

Jinesh Gandhi: What kind of price increases we have taken?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, in September, we have again announced a 2% price increase in the truck business. We will have to see how much of it will go straight to the bottomline. The team is working on it because the discounting is rife in the industry. You know it, and we have to keep pace. We have to keep a fine balance between our market share and profitability. So, that is what our team is working on.

Jamshed Dadabhoy: Thanks for the opportunity. Just a couple of questions. First one, you alluded that construction is 40%, 45% of demand. So, could you give us a sense of what tipper sales were for last year for the full fiscal and first half this year and how the growth has been in that segment?

Vinod K. Dasari: See, Jamshed, we do not actually give the breakup of the subsegments as you are aware. So, we broadly give breakups on the truck and bus business. The tipper sales have grown, that much I can tell you.

Jamshed Dadabhoy: Okay. Fair enough. And second question on the Euro-VI prebuy that we are expecting. Like, what is the level of conviction that we have, because even when we had transitioned to BS-IV, there was not much of a prebuy. Obviously, it coincided at that time the demonetization. But where I am coming from is supposed the trucker were to buy next year and by FY2021 when you move to Euro-VI, or BS-VI, your residual value will start to fall quite sharply because you are not moving one emission standard, you are moving 2 emission standards. So, that is where I was coming from that what is the sense that we really have in terms of and how much discounting what we have to give to convince someone to move to buy a vehicle next year?

Dheeraj G Hinduja: Well, Vinod, do you want to answer it?

Vinod K. Dasari: Next year, the demand will be good I do not think there will be that much discounting because typically, in the world whenever BS-VI has come, or Euro-VI has come, the prebuy has been roughly 30% to 40% increase in TIV. So, I expect that to happen. So, let us see what it does and so I do not think people will just give discounts like that.

Gopal Mahadevan: And the vehicles will become more expensive as well when you go from BS-IV to BS-VI. One of the reasons why a prebuy happens is because vehicles will become more expensive to purchase. So, there is no reason why the prebuy would not happen unless, of course, there is an exception with it.

Jamshed Dadabhoy: Thank you. All the best for the future. I will come back for more questions.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Amyn Pirani of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Amyn Pirani: Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to go back to the issue on the credit availability. I mean, are you already seeing that demand is getting impacted because of credit availability? And is there like a solution in the near term? Or is it just something that you are concerned about?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, we will have to wait and watch. It has been about a month since it has happened. Obviously, there has been a lot of news on credit squeeze on NBFCs and NBFCs are a very important lifeline for this industry in terms of the funding that happens because the entire industry almost is funded. As far as HLFL goes, our own subsidiary, all I can tell you that from our own in-house experience, I think there has been no impact at all. The funding lines are very much in place, and we have not seen anything which is, at the moment, negative impacting. I am sure the larger NBFCs will not be having the issue. The smaller ones could be. They could be facing a crunch, but I think the government is also looking at ensuring that this does not snowball into something, which becomes very negative. But short term, yes, there is a little bit of credit squeeze that you can see. We will wait and watch how November and December pans out.

Amyn Pirani: Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kapil Singh from Nomura. Please go ahead.

Kapil Singh: Can you update on discounts, how they move between Q1 and Q2? And also, some color on exports? We have not seen the kind of traction we were hoping for.

Vinod K. Dasari: Well, discounts have been going pretty I mean, the discounting, I would say in the market has been dicey. We have seen that happening because everybody is chasing the same customer, and I mean, we sometimes have to reluctantly follow in this. But otherwise, discounting has continued to be high. I mean, it depends on the type of vehicle, but it can go from anywhere between 2 lakhs to 3 lakhs to over 4 lakhs and 4.5 lakhs also in certain deals. So, this is the answer to your first question. What was your second one?

Kapil Singh: Sir, on discounts, can you share like what is the average in Q1 and Q2? How it has moved?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, I would say that the average discounting in terms of Q1 and Q2, the numbers have been, I would say that Q1 would have been something like about 3.75 lakhs or So, on the truck. And Q2 could be something like about 4 to 4.1 lakhs. So, you see that happening. You see it doesn't kind of give an accuracy to the number but gives a direction to the number. As far as exports are concerned, the overall volumes for the quarter were a tad low. We had numbers of 2759 for the quarter as opposed to 4437 in the same quarter last year. So, we were down by about 38%. Some of the exports that we had planned for, especially in Africa, did not happen. We will have to wait for the customer to indicate the invoicing for us. But all said and done, there's also another challenge that we see in the short term. In the short term, we are seeing that Sri Lanka is a very important market for us. The second one is Middle East. The entire Middle East market has been affected by a confluence of factors. So, we have seen a depletion in the Middle Eastern volumes, which, again, hopefully, in the fourth quarter, we hopefully will see a catch-up.

Kapil Singh: Okay. And could you also update on the LCV subsidiary merger and any indicative like what is the 1H profitability of that subsidiary?

Gopal Mahadevan: Well, I think LCV is doing very well. We have seen the overall numbers grow by 42%. The LCV volumes for the quarter were 13572 as opposed to 9588. It has been a very profitable. You would have seen the last full year numbers. At the moment, I can't give you the subsidiary numbers. All I can say is that, you can all be rest assured that combined, Ashok Leyland's LCV business as well as the LCV subsidiaries are PAT positive, and they are accretive to Ashok Leyland EBITDA margins.

Moderator: Mr. Singh, may we request you to come back in the queue for a follow-up, please. Thank you. The next question is from the line of Shyam Sundar Sriram from Sundaram Mutual Fund.

Shyam Sundar Sriram: Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, we had introduced this Innoline engines using inline pumps. Which tonnage segments are we targeting with this engine? I understand while the maintenance cost over the lifetime may be lower for the end customers, does it also lead to a lower upfront cost?

Vinod K. Dasari: It is lower upfront cost.

Gopal Mahadevan: It is lower maintenance cost. It may or may not be lower upfront price.

Shyam Sundar Sriram: Okay. Sir, which tonnage segment are we targeting with this?

Vinod K. Dasari: We have launched with 6 x 2 and 8 x 2 vehicles.

Shyam Sundar Sriram: Okay. Just one housekeeping question if you can please share the domestic truck and bus exports and the revenue mix, please.

Gopal Mahadevan: You want the volumes?

Shyam Sundar Sriram: No, Sir. The revenue mix that you usually provide between the domestic trucks, buses, exports and defense?

Gopal Mahadevan: We normally provide the domestic truck and bus. I will give you the numbers. The total revenues for trucks for Q2 were Rs.5383 Crores. The bus revenues were Rs.565 Crores. Exports accounted for about Rs.454 Crores. The overall revenues were Rs.7608 Crores.

Shyam Sundar Sriram: Thank you. That is it from my side.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pramod Amte. Please go ahead.

Pramod Amte: The first question is considering the humongous amount of challenges the industry faces to move towards BS-VI and the safety norms and also the company is also going through substantially gear up for the same. How well you feel you are staffed in different divisions to take care of this challenge?

And second, looking at your own internal leadership programs, what is the probability that you will upgrade somebody internally into the CEO post, So, that the investors can get more comfort in terms of this transition period?

Vinod K. Dasari: The first question, just to clarify, the first question was on the Euro-VI readiness, right? I mean, the BS-VI readiness?

Pramod Amte: No, across the challenges considering how well you are staffed in different divisions considering that there is a CEO change expected over next 6 months?

Vinod K. Dasari: I did not understand the question. What does BS VI have to do with CEO change?

Gopal Mahadevan: Yes, exactly.

Vinod K. Dasari: We are ready with BS-VI, if that is your question. As far as the leadership change is concerned, as Chairman said, it will be decided by the board and the Remuneration Committee.

Pramod Amte: Thanks a lot. All the best.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Pramod Kumar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Pramod Kumar: Thanks a lot for the opportunity. Congratulations to the team led by Vinod. My question is for Dheeraj. Dheeraj, now that we have you on the call, I want to understand how you think about Leyland from a 5-year perspective because if you look at the last 5 years, you transformed literally in terms of both market share, your balance sheet, your product capability, a number of J.D. Power awards under the belt now. So, but how do you see the company transforming in the next 5 years? And I also want to kind of link it to your opening comments where you talked about the entire business as well. So, if you can just share your view for the company from a 5-year perspective that will be really helpful.

Dheeraj G Hinduja: Sure. I think I am extremely confident because today, the foundation is very strong and specifically, first dealing the international side that you mentioned. You see from many years, Ashok Leyland was primarily exporting buses. Now for the first time going forward, we have a whole range of vehicles that have been ready for left and right-hand drive countries as well, and especially the LCV range and the new products we have been producing over there. So, I firmly believe that the international markets and growth will be quite substantial going forward in that area. From the domestic market itself, of course, it has been a good rise the last 5 years. It has been challenging. And looking at the current market environment, competition is intense in terms of discounting. But according to me, we are in a position to continue this growth. Our network has expanded quite substantially throughout the country. Our market share in the north and east, which are our traditional weaker markets, has grown very well. So, I do not see any reason why we should not be in a position to continue this market share growth as well along with the new product range that we have introduced. We have a number of digital initiatives that have been launched over the last 12 months, 18 months. They are also beginning to contribute meaningfully to the company. So, looking ahead across-the-board, the next 5 years, there are, I would say the next 6 months with the elections coming up in India as well, there could be some challenges. But beyond that, I believe we are well positioned to address the international market, our defense efforts, and especially the LCV range that comes in. As you might be fully aware, we started a vision 6 or 7 years ago that we have to be in the top 10 globally in our trucks and top 5 in buses. That was the reason for putting that vision into play, which is to ensure that unless we had volume, it will be very difficult to compete in the industry. So, when we started, we were at #19 globally. Today, we are at #12, 13. And I am very confident that we should be able to get our vision of being in the top 10 very soon as well.

Pramod Kumar: Sounds great. And my second question is to Vinod. Vinod, you pointed out that normally across the world when Euro-VI transition happens, the prebuy is around 30%. If you can help us understand what is the after effect of the prebuy when the regulation kicks in, in year 1. How does the industry normally fare because that is one question, which you kind of grapple with as we understand this is going to be a solid pre-buy? But what happens thereafter? And that is probably part of the reason why the CV Companies are getting rewarded for the robust demand, what we have seen in the last 7, 8 months, where they have been massive upgrades across the street and knowing that there is a prebuy of 30%, which is going to bump next year. But everyone waits about what happens after that. So, if you can help us understand what's the general global read across is?

Vinod K. Dasari: Well, the fact that it is called prebuy means that somebody has borrowed next year's demand this year. So, that is obvious. The 30% demand is boxed forward then that much would be the demand that would be lower in the year after, but there are 3 things countering it. The demand like I said is 45% to 50% coming from construction and these construction projects are something that is not one-offs. They will continue to be there, and hence, the demand will still continue to come back even if there is Euro-VI or if somebody needs a tipper, he needs a tipper, does not care if that is Euro-VI or Euro IV. The acquisition cost goes up a little bit, but he still needs to complete his projects, for which he gets the tender. The second thing that will happen is that there is a scrappage policy that the government has announced that we have entered from April 2020 where all 20-year-old vehicles will go out of stock or will have to be scrapped. That alone is about 200000 to 300000 vehicles even if you assume that only about 20%, 30% of them will be scrapped in the first year, that's good enough to make up the volume drop because of the prebuy. The third thing that from an Ashok Leyland's standpoint as I was mentioning earlier, every single one of our vehicles from 2 tonne all the way up to 55 tonne is being designed for Euro-VI as well as LHD and our cabs are European crash compliant. So, we will have a significantly larger, significantly larger market, where we can play rather than the export markets that we play in today. And that is why I do not think there will be any downside, if at all, there might be an upside.

Pramod Kumar: The industry growth is what you mean, right?

Vinod K. Dasari: No. The third one is not for the industry. I cannot talk about other competitors. But we are certainly going to be the first movers in the industry.

Pramod Kumar: Thanks a lot. Best of luck gentlemen. Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ronak Sarda from Systematix. Please go ahead.

Ronak Sarda: Thanks for the opportunity. Sir, just to follow up on the NBFC and credit crunch, which you highlighted. Can you share how the situation in the used truck market and LCVs as well, because LCVs more of single driver, a single employed people and they might be more dependent on the NBFC funding?

Vinod K. Dasari: LCVs, not only the TIV has grown quite substantially, we have also grown. Our volumes have gone up about 40%.

Ronak Sarda: Right, Sir. I was asking the impact of NBFC for the liquidity crisis?

Vinod K. Dasari: Short-term thing, most of it is by driven by owner-operators. So, I do not think it was that big an impact.

Ronak Sarda: Okay. And any impact on the secondhand trucks or the used truck market?

Vinod K. Dasari: No, I don't think so. Secondhand market is there. It has always been there. Every vehicle is sold at least 2 or 3 times in the lifetime of it.

Ronak Sarda: So, there is no, I mean, slow down in the face of used/scrapped market due to financing?

Vinod K. Dasari: No, no.

Ronak Sarda: Sure. And Sir, second thing was on the prebuy. I mean, do you think there is a possibility that given no OEM has announced a major capacity announcement, there is some prebuying happening today as well? I mean, in the current year as well? Or do you think the customer won't take the risk of paying EMI for a year in advance because given the higher discount and as you said, next year these discounts might go away. Given your interactions with customers, do you think there's a chance that some prebuy happening today as well?

Vinod K. Dasari: It is starting to happen prebuy because what has happened on the BS-III prebuy happened for BS-IV. The prices went up. We know that when BS-VI prebuy happens, and everybody can start to hit capacity towards the end of FY2020, there will be again price increases, right? Because the suppliers will increase the prices and OEMs will increase prices, discounts will come down. So, some people are thinking if I have some demand, I might as well buy now. But I do not think in our industry anybody buys vehicle if he does not have demand. You must have something, and he may only say, making advanced decision rather than delay it.

Ronak Sarda: Great Sir. Thanks for the clarity and all the best for your future endeavors.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Gunjan Prithyani from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Gunjan Prithyani: Thanks for taking my questions. I have 2 questions. Firstly, on this axle load now. A lot of industry feedback is coming that there has been some incremental capacity creation, which is happening with the lag and which is reflected in freight reduction in certain industries or in terms of some freight operators talking about cutting their truck ordering. What is your reading of the axle load norms? Do you think have you seen that there is a capacity creation, which is starting to reflect in the market now?

Vinod K. Dasari: The axle load norm was a big red herring to me. I had said during that time also that 65% of the market doesn't even get affected because it's volumetric, right? And the balance, there was anyway over-loading. So, how should that have an impact? In July, this was announced. In July, August and September, we saw nearly 30% increase in TIV. So, whatever was to be done is done. I don't think there will be any impact of that.

Gunjan Prithyani: You have not seen anything with the lag because there was clearly feedback from some of the industries coming that this freight reduction because of axle load non-relaxation. So, I am just trying to gauge is there something that we see with the lag? Or you still think that there is going to be no impact at all?

Vinod K. Dasari: No, I do not think so.

Gunjan Prithyani: Okay. And the second question I had was on the realizations. They seem to be a bit down. Is this because of discounting levels being high? Or is it more to do with the mix of the revenues. If you can provide some color on this.

Vinod K. Dasari: So, I think as I mentioned earlier, there has been an increase in the discounts. And I think that has impacted the realizations. Of course, from my hope, that has been the industry phenomenon. Q2 net realizations have been worse. As far as Ashok Leyland is concerned, there was also a confluence of mix like I mentioned that our BS-III volumes were lower in Q1 and also the same period last year. So, we had seen that absolute realization getting actually divided by the total volume. It would actually reflect that the realizations have dropped, but these are the 2 major reasons why we will actually see the realizations come off.

Gunjan Prithyani: And in the truck business, the 22% growth MHCV, the tonnage growth would you be able to give any sense? Would it be significantly higher than this number? Or it is broadly aligned to this number?

Vinod K. Dasari: No. It would be higher because very clearly over the last 12 to 18 months, we have been seeing the industry actually grow to the higher tonnage. And So, we will actually see that number. We do not have that number readily, but the other thing that we are doing in Leyland, which is very important for us, we are trying to de-risk this company. So, consistently over the last 4 to 5 years, we have been also increasing the size of our ICV portfolio. So, our ICV market share would have been something like about 12% to 14%, 4 years ago. Today is about somewhere around 25%. So, that's another way of derisking the company, you keep filling in slots into the product portfolio and you also increased your distribution by which you actually ensure that you are far, far more stable than you were 4 to 5 years ago.

Gunjan Prithyani: There was product launches, which were planned around the LCV. What is the update on that? And anything we can hear in the next couple of quarters?

Vinod K. Dasari: Yes, I think it has been pretty much on track. I think as far as we had the upgrade of DOST being launched. And that is doing very, very well. The LCV team is also working on the LHD variant for export markets, and you should be hearing some announcements in the later part of the year on that. And, of course, we are also on a special project internally for over the next possibly 12, 18 months. You would also see a completely new vehicle coming from the LCV platform. Very clearly, again, the strategy in the LCV is we had only one vehicle called DOST. Now we have now accelerated the penetration of both the PARTNER and MiTR, which is the higher tonnage vehicle. PARTNER is the 4-ton vehicle and then MiTR is the 27- to 30-seater bus, which is on the LCV platform. We are looking at filling in the slots between the LCV and Boss. Boss is the 9 and 12-tonne ICV. So, you would see a lot more action coming in there as well.

Gunjan Prithyani: Thank you So, much.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Hitesh Goel from Kotak Securities. Please go ahead.

Hitesh Goel: Thanks a lot for taking my question. Congratulations to Mr. Dasari for a successful career in Ashok Leyland and also best wishes for the future. Sir, just wanted to get some sense on your outlook because last quarter, you had said that you were talking about 10% to 12% industry growth in FY2019. Can you share your revised outlook? Because I think you said - you shared that it would be 15% to 20% growth. Any revisions on that?

Vinod K. Dasari: When we last spoke, I said 10% assuming that the balance of the year will be flat. But last quarter the TIV has grown up by 30%. So, I would say that now if I say it will be flat, it will still 15% to 20% growth. And October was higher than last year October. So, I do not know how but I think it is still strong.

Hitesh Goel: Okay. And Sir, second question is that on the freight rate outlook. So, basically, now that oil prices have declined, have you saw freight rate increase in September. Are you seeing freight rates stabilizing now or coming down with diesel cost? How should we see the freight rates because that gives an indication of the truck utilization level side of the fleet?

Vinod K. Dasari: I think the freight rates will come down a little bit because of the diesel cost. And when the diesel costs go up, the freight rates go up. So, many of our customers have indexed to fuel cost.

Hitesh Goel: Yes, but the fleet utilization levels are quite high. Is that what should read from your comment?

Vinod K. Dasari: Utilization levels are quite high. And what I am saying is that the market will continue to remain strong.

Hitesh Goel: Great Sir. All the best. Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Priya Ranjan from Antique Stock. Please go ahead.

Priya Ranjan: Thanks for taking my question. First of all, best wishes to Mr. Dasari for his future endeavor, really remarkable career for the last 14, 15 years with Ashok Leyland. And coming back about to question. One is on the construction side. When we are saying that it is around 40%, 45% market is from the construction. So, typically, construction side, the lifecycle of truck is also very, very short. So, is this an indication that probably the cycle may not be So, low, probably when the next cycle turns down for the industry? And the second part is on the overall strategy of the company. I mean, we have talked about one-third from truck and bus and one-third from export market and all, plus defense, etc. So, can we see some Alliance or JV in the future to achieve that strategy?

Vinod K. Dasari: That is the vision that was set by the Chairman and the board sometime ago. And as Dheeraj mentioned earlier, there is no change in strategy. If that implementation of that strategy requires us to continue some alliances, we would be happy to look at it. But like I was telling earlier, the product portfolio that we have been is so, strong that we are confident of expansion growth ourselves.

Priya Ranjan: And on the construction side, I mean, because the life cycle of the construction trucks is typically much, much shorter?

Vinod K. Dasari: Correct. So, what we look at as a lead indicator the number of construction projects that are being awarded by the government. So, the more construction projects are there, the bigger our market becomes.

Priya Ranjan: Okay. And Sir, on the ICV side. I mean, ICV, typically, now the markets there has been in and around that period for last, I mean, for many months or So, and some of the regions we have done well, but some of the regions we are not able to deeply penetrate yet. So, what kind of regional strategy we can think of from the ICV rates?

Vinod K. Dasari: There is no regional strategy per se. I mean, if you put a regional strategy, there would clearly be a pricing game. And we do not want to play that game. So, ICV, we are launching a new product in the 10 tonnes, which is going to be the market leader in terms of the efficiency. We are not going to launch way too many projects. And we have several new ones in high horsepower tipper and high horsepower tractor trailer, ICV segment, new buses coming, but beyond that, we will focus more on Euro-VI and So, on.

Priya Ranjan: Okay. And lastly, on the Euro-VI engine-related thing. So, we are now developing in-house. We're also looking at HINO and Cummins, if I am not wrong.

Priya Ranjan: Okay. So, I mean, it will be, I mean, it will be a mix of both launches in terms of engine or it will be either of the 2?

Moderator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Chirag Shah from Edelweiss. Please go ahead.

Chirag Shah: Two questions on my side. One on this new axle load norms. So, are the newly designed trucks now available in the system from Ashok Leyland as well as from peers in general? Or they are rollout is still yet to happen?

Vinod K. Dasari: Yes, yes, yes. Some customers want the old version. Some customers want the new version. It is very interesting to see how this is playing out, Chirag. But like I said, in many cases, it does not matter, right? It is volumetric. Two-thirds of the market it does not matter.

Chirag Shah: No. I was more trying to understand from consumer behavior perspective that are they still preferring the older versions, or they are looking to buy newer ones?

Vinod K. Dasari: Most are wanting the higher axle load. They are wanting the new ones.

Chirag Shah: Yes. And second question was on the 43-tonner that we had showcased. Any update when can we expect? Because when we check at ground level, there seems to be a good amount of interest on that product. I would guess there was at the time when you launched the 37T lift axle.

Vinod K. Dasari: I think it will come this quarter.

Chirag Shah: In fact, some guys were showing some kind of frustration. It is not getting launched earlier.

Vinod K. Dasari: That is good, no? Maybe we should create a prebuy for that, start taking bookings.

Chirag Shah: Yes, and just one clarification on the commodity side. Gopal, if you can highlight. So, most of the pressures are there in the quarter or how should we look at the cost pressures and which are the areas that we see the cost pressures?

Gopal Mahadevan: No, you asked commodity. Commodity steel prices are certainly going northwards. We expect that in the second half. It is an expectation, it is not an outlook because you see that passenger car volumes are actually coming off a bit, and they are one of the largest consumers of steel. So, that is going to happen. And if there is softening of steel, which is actually benchmarked predominantly from China, if you see that happening and if the rupee were also to kind of appreciate a bit, all of this should augur well for softening of steel prices in India. But at the moment, quarter-on-quarter, we've actually seen steel prices going up, which has been having a cost push effect on in the industry such as ours.

Chirag Shah: Thank you.

Moderator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will take the last question from the line of Mukesh Saraf from Spark Capital. Please go ahead.

Mukesh Saraf: Thank you for the opportunity. Firstly, again on the prebuy itself. There is a slight change in that in the sense that we cannot sell I mean, we cannot sell any vehicle also after March 31. Earlier we only could not produce. Does that change anything for us in terms of the prebuy expectations? Would we have to start planning well in advance and the prebuy periods have shortened? How do you see tackling that issue?

Vinod K. Dasari: All that would do to not have pain from April 1 or not have registration from April 1.

Mukesh Saraf: Okay, okay. I mean, in the sense does it affect us in terms of production planning? And if we're left with any inventory, would we be able to kind of manage it just exporting that BS IV vehicle?

Vinod K. Dasari: Yes, yes, we should be able to. I mean, our technology as you know, even when the BS-III BS-IV happened is very modular, and we were able to just simply change the engine. The day we start to make BS VI, and that operates in a different fuel grade completely.

Mukesh Saraf: Right, right.

Vinod K. Dasari: Yes. Leftover BS IV engines/vehicle, we will sell them outside.

Mukesh Saraf: Okay. So, it does not really affect us much.

Vinod K. Dasari: Yes. If necessary, if I want the BS IV vehicle, I can convert it to a BS III vehicle also.

Mukesh Saraf: Right, right, right. And Sir, secondly is on the scrappage policy that you mentioned. As of now, isn't that voluntary scrappage, sir? Or is it mandatory scrappage? For 20 year and above?

Vinod K. Dasari: Mandatory.

Mukesh Saraf: Okay. It's mandatory. Okay, okay. That clarifies. Thank you, Sir. That is it from my side."
"12","1024826011","2018-12-22","https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/rbi-seriously-underestimated-nbfc-problem-googlies-like-ilfs-should-not-have-happened-ex-cea-arvind-subramanian/1422356/","RBI seriously underestimated NBFC problem... Googlies like IL&FS should not have happened: Ex-CEA Arvind Subramanian","The Financial Express",FALSE,"SUNNY VERMA: You recently called demonetisation a 'massive, draconian monetary shock'.

I learned two things about demonetisation. I offer the fairly controversial hypothesis that imposing a lot of costs on a lot of people was intrinsic to its political success. I believe that when you have charismatic leaders, it's easier to take action against many than it is to take on narrow vested interests. It has proved difficult to take on large farmers, fertiliser industry lobbies, public sector unions but apparently it's not difficult to impose (such a cost) on the entire informal sector.

The second question is whether it was a draconian move. In the Economic Survey, we called it a large structural shock. What you call it doesn't matter because when you take away 86% cash, it's not small... I remember having a discussion about this with (The New York Time's) Paul Krugman over breakfast, and also with (American economists) Ken Rogoff and Jeffrey Frankel. They were astounded that how is it that you take away 86% cash and the growth rate remains around 7-7.5%. Anyone would have predicted negative growth based on this.

HARISH DAMODARAN: Can you elaborate more on these costs imposed on people?

There are a series of related ideas on that. One explanation was that you (the government) wanted to show that you are against black money. My answer is, if you only wanted to show that you are against the corrupt rich, you had other instruments to target them... It had to be more than that. So when you impose a lot of costs on a lot of people... people think that if I'm suffering, so are the others. Second is the sense of shared sacrifice, that we are all in this together. If the impact had been partial, then all these doubts would have arisen about who was left out and why.

P VAIDYANATHAN IYER: Following demonetisation, officials in the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry expected Rs2-3 lakh crore to not come back. Eventually, 99% of the money came back. Did you have a similar expectation?

All these calculations were done post demonetisation. I think it is fair to say that some amount -- Rs2 or 3 lakh crore -- was expected not to come back. If it hadn't come back, you could have said that some serious wealth destruction happened, that affected the corrupt rich. Of course, that did not happen. But the fact that all this came back does not necessarily mean that costs were not imposed on the corrupt rich. The cost could have been imposed as they may have had to launder it or declare and pay taxes on it.

SUNNY VERMA: There was a lot of expectation that the government would deliver a high growth rate and more jobs. But now even a 7% growth rate looks imposing. What do you think went wrong?

I would point to three reasons. One is that the freeing of the financial sector took a lot of time, and it's still a work in progress. We enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in 2016, but in 2018, we realised that the problem is far from being resolved. The financial system is still not in a position to finance investment because the clean-up of corporates and banks has only just begun.

I have looked at agricultural growth of the last 50 years. The highest period of agricultural growth was between 2003 and 2007-08, during which there was a massive global agricultural commodity boom which benefited India. In the last few years, agriculture has gone the other way. We had droughts in the first two years. In the next two, we had good production but, for a variety of reasons, farmer incomes and prices collapsed. The third thing is exports. The flip side of low oil prices was that you had huge capital inflow, the exchange rate appreciated by 20%. As the world economy went down, our manufacturing export growth and services export growth were not even remotely as buoyant as they used to be.

RITIKA CHOPRA: Were you consulted before the demonetisation announcement was made?

My book is not a kiss-and-tell memoir about who knew what and when. When demonetisation was announced, as an economist, I was trying to understand all its complexities -- what the costs and benefits would be. So, there was also a lot of honest learning for me about how it might pan out.

SUSHANT SINGH: A recent survey by the All India Manufacturers' Organisation lists the GST as one of the reasons for job losses and declining profits in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Why was the GST not as simple as it was expected to be?

First, there were two policy decisions (demonetisation and the GST) done in quick succession and both impacted the informal sector. There is absolutely no doubt that had the GST been simpler, we might have avoided some of the problems. To be fair to the system, when you can't have simplicity, then complex policy leads to ultra-complex procedures. But once the concerns about SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) were expressed, the GST Council took a lot of measures to simplify procedures.

LIZ MATHEW: In the recent past, we have seen Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar and NITI Aayog's Arvind Panagariya quit citing personal reasons. Do you think it is difficult to work with the government?

I don't know anything about their situation. I also left for personal reasons. I keep saying it's the best job I ever had. I had a dream boss. These positions are quite delicate. Everyone has to find his or her own way of navigating through challenges.

LIZ MATHEW: We keep hearing about how the Modi government has turned around the economy. Is it really a rosy picture?

In my book, I say there were some major achievements and there were some shortcomings. The two big achievements are the GST, which needs to be improved, and the Bankruptcy Code... The RBI is also doing a lot on the resolution process, for which they deserve a lot of credit. The third big achievement is a kind of new welfarism. The government is providing essential private goods and services especially to the poor using technology. It's not handouts and welfare, it's not primary health and education necessarily; it is about providing toilets, cooking gas, rural housing, power, medical care. This is what I would say is quite distinctive about this government.

KRISHN KAUSHIK: One of the promises made by this government was the creation of two crore jobs. Do you think job growth has been satisfactory?

There is really no hard basis for making any claims about employment. The latest data available is from 2011. All data released post 2011 has some major methodological difficulty to be considered reliable... I have always said that the reason the employment issue keeps coming up is that, during the boom period, three sectors did very well -- agriculture, construction and IT. These three job creators have not been doing well.

KRISHN KAUSHIK: The recently released back series data lowered the GDP growth rates for a major part of the UPA era. Do you trust the credibility of the data?

I am not a statistician and I haven't looked at the data. But if you look at a variety of indicators in that period -- exports, credit, capital inflow, investment, corporate profits -- they were much higher. Despite all this, if we are saying that GDP growth is the same, it invites a lot of questions. It is not something one can easily accept at face value. We don't want to be in a situation where every time data comes out, our institutions get so discredited that we start doubting every number. The only solution is that we must have experts -- because it's a very technical exercise -- and only institutions with experts should adjudicate this and come out with a verdict.

Banikinkar Pattanayak: One of the reasons for Urjit Patel resigning as RBI chief was said to be the government's decision to invoke Section 7 of the RBI Act, which allows it to issue directions to the RBI.

I don't know if Section 7 was invoked or not, but I do think when you take extreme measures, it has the serious risk of compromising the independence of an institution that is so revered and respected like the Indian RBI. That being said, I think we should also be mindful -- and I say this in my book -- that the RBI also needs to be held accountable for a lot of things. I think it seriously underestimated the magnitude of the NBFCs' problem, for example. We have had googlies coming out of nowhere like IL&FS, which clearly should not have happened.

Sandeep Singh: How do you see the trend of political parties announcing debt waivers? Do you see that as a challenge to the economy and the banking system?

Loan waivers are very inefficient and not a very good instrument to achieve agricultural objectives. Even if you can't achieve those objectives by improving productivity, there are much better ways of providing a push -- Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), the Telangana Rythu Bandhu scheme, for instance -- that don't carry the perverse incentives of loan waivers, which penalise those who don't borrow at all from the formal system. Second, it penalises those who borrow and repay. But I do think that when states are promising this, at least in principle, the Centre has control... (They can say) 'You'll face fiscal constraints, we control how much borrowing you can do, if you have to give a loan waiver, you still have to meet the fiscal deficit by legislation since you have to cut something else'. That's a way of saying that you have to bear the political cost of that. So loan waivers are a problematic, inefficient, very perverse way of achieving agricultural objectives.

Aanchal Magazine: Earlier, the transfer of RBI's surplus reserves was done once a year. Then the demands for interim transfers came in. Won't this become a habit, with governments dipping into the RBI's reserves? Where does one draw the line?

Are there surplus reserves? Unambiguously, there are. If you apply international practice on how much should be the optimal reserves -- and that's what we did in the recent EPW paper -- it is clear that there are excess reserves. But what do you do about the political policy question? Because it is unusual, it (transfer of reserves) should be used very carefully. When I said it should only be used for recapitalisation of banks, that captures the spirit that you can't do this again and again and you can do it only for things that can have important long-run consequences. Recapitalisation of banks is like an investment in the financial system. Also, I think it should be done cooperatively and not unilaterally. As I say in the book as well, look at what, all over the world, especially after the global financial crisis, distinguished central banks -- European Central Bank (ECB), Fed Reserves -- did. They said the global financial crisis is very unusual, we're going to deploy the central bank balance sheet in order to address these one-off problems. My quibble with the RBI is, why did it never voluntarily say that? Why didn't it say at some point in time that we have a strong balance sheet and we volunteer to put the RBI balance sheet to solve the financial-sector problem, of course only under certain conditions. Then there would be no question of the government raiding the RBI. What I would like all of you to ponder upon is think of it the other way, not about the government raiding the RBI, but how perhaps the RBI could have behaved differently.

Sumit Jha: Back to the GST, was the budget estimate too ambitious? The average monthly collection is falling short by Rs15,000 crore.

If the budget is demanding something much higher of the GST, then you would kind of infer that maybe the budget got ahead of what were the underlying conditions of the economy. So it's a bit unfair to blame the GST revenue for targets that were set in the budget. I don't think the GST revenue is doing that badly.

Banikinkar Pattanayak: Do you think the RBI board should be empowered to have a more proactive role or should the decision-making process be left to the RBI management?

My sense is that the board is meant to give overall guidance and not get involved in all kinds of details.

Ravish Tiwari: What proportion of the current balance sheet mess would you attribute to the UPA and how much to the current government?

For that, you need to look at numbers carefully, in terms of actual timing, loan by loan. I don't think anyone has done that calculation. I would say (the problem) is predominantly legacy and a smaller proportion of it is new, but it's impossible to say whether it's 70-30, 80-20, 60-40. As I say in the book, the original sin for the twin balance sheet problem was the excessive lending that took place in the boom years. How much was then and how much later, it really would be impossible to say.

RAVISH TIWARI: As an economist, you have followed how countries have grown, you study and teach economic history, you know as much history as the new RBI Governor knows economics. Do you think you're eligible to be chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research?

Just as I said statistics should be done by experts, if I was offered the chairmanship of ICHR, a) I shouldn't be offered the job; b) if I was offered, I shouldn't accept it; and c) if I accept it, you should write columns saying this guy is the pits. P Vaidyanathan Iyer: Is there a possibility of India becoming a welfare state -- not just at the federal level, but smaller provincial levels? What happens to reforms then? We should remind ourselves that we've always been a welfarist country. I think we're a wonderful democracy, of course, but that means there will always be pressures to redistribute. The challenge for us is to find efficient ways of redistributing. Subsidies is a very inefficient way of doing that. There are all kinds of price controls and that creates problems. I think we should be thinking of non-distorting ways, with things like Universal Basic Income and DBT as ways of the future."

Googlies like IL&FS should not have happened: Arvind Subramanian","The Indian Express",FALSE,"Former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian deliberates on demonetisation and why he thinks it was a 'massive, draconian monetary shock'. In his latest book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of The Modi-Jaitley Economy, he examines the puzzle of why demonetisation didn't have a bigger impact on the GDP or on BJP politically.

Former Chief Economic Adviser Arvind Subramanian was a key policy adviser to the Union Government and his out-of-the-box ideas -- including using RBI reserves for capitalising public sector banks, a Universal Basic Income, and deploying JAM (Jan Dhan, Aadhaar and Mobile) trinity to deliver public goods -- generated debate within and outside government. In his latest book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of The Modi-Jaitley Economy, Subramanian examines the puzzle of why demonetisation -- which he has called a ""massive, draconian shock"" -- didn't have a bigger impact on the GDP or on BJP politically.

SUNNY VERMA: You recently called demonetisation a 'massive, draconian monetary shock'.

I learned two things about demonetisation. I offer the fairly controversial hypothesis that imposing a lot of costs on a lot of people was intrinsic to its political success. I believe that when you have charismatic leaders, it's easier to take action against many than it is to take on narrow vested interests. It has proved difficult to take on large farmers, fertiliser industry lobbies, public sector unions but apparently it's not difficult to impose (such a cost) on the entire informal sector.

The second question is whether it was a draconian move. In the Economic Survey, we called it a large structural shock. What you call it doesn't matter because when you take away 86 per cent cash, it's not small... I remember having a discussion about this with (The New York Time's) Paul Krugman over breakfast, and also with (American economists) Ken Rogoff and Jeffrey Frankel. They were astounded that how is it that you take away 86 per cent cash and the growth rate remains around 7-7.5 per cent. Anyone would have predicted negative growth based on this.

HARISH DAMODARAN: Can you elaborate more on these costs imposed on people?

There are a series of related ideas on that. One explanation was that you (the government) wanted to show that you are against black money. My answer is, if you only wanted to show that you are against the corrupt rich, you had other instruments to target them... It had to be more than that. So when you impose a lot of costs on a lot of people... people think that if I'm suffering, so are the others. Second is the sense of shared sacrifice, that we are all in this together. If the impact had been partial, then all these doubts would have arisen about who was left out and why.

P V VAIDYANATHAN IYER: Following demonetisation, officials in the Prime Minister's Office and the Finance Ministry expected Rs 2-3 lakh crore to not come back. Eventually, 99 per cent of the money came back. Did you have a similar expectation?

All these calculations were done post demonetisation. I think it is fair to say that some amount -- Rs 2 or 3 lakh crore -- was expected not to come back. If it hadn't come back, you could have said that some serious wealth destruction happened, that affected the corrupt rich. Of course, that did not happen. But the fact that all this came back does not necessarily mean that costs were not imposed on the corrupt rich. The cost could have been imposed as they may have had to launder it or declare and pay taxes on it.

SUNNY VERMA: There was a lot of expectation that the government would deliver a high growth rate and more jobs. But now even a 7 per cent growth rate looks imposing. What do you think went wrong?

I would point to three reasons. One is that the freeing of the financial sector took a lot of time, and it's still a work in progress. We enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code in 2016, but in 2018, we realised that the problem is far from being resolved. The financial system is still not in a position to finance investment because the clean-up of corporates and banks has only just begun.

I have looked at agricultural growth of the last 50 years. The highest period of agricultural growth was between 2003 and 2007-08, during which there was a massive global agricultural commodity boom which benefited India. In the last few years, agriculture has gone the other way. We had droughts in the first two years. In the next two, we had good production but, for a variety of reasons, farmer incomes and prices collapsed.

The third thing is exports. The flip side of low oil prices was that you had huge capital inflow, the exchange rate appreciated by 20 per cent. As the world economy went down, our manufacturing export growth and services export growth were not even remotely as buoyant as they used to be.

RITIKA CHOPRA: Were you consulted before the demonetisation announcement was made?

My book is not a kiss-and-tell memoir about who knew what and when. When demonetisation was announced, as an economist, I was trying to understand all its complexities -- what the costs and benefits would be. So, there was also a lot of honest learning for me about how it might pan out.

SUSHANT SINGH: A recent survey by the All India Manufacturers' Organisation lists the GST as one of the reasons for job losses and declining profits in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). Why was the GST not as simple as it was expected to be?

First, there were two policy decisions (demonetisation and the GST) done in quick succession and both impacted the informal sector. There is absolutely no doubt that had the GST been simpler, we might have avoided some of the problems. To be fair to the system, when you can't have simplicity, then complex policy leads to ultra-complex procedures. But once the concerns about SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) were expressed, the GST Council took a lot of measures to simplify procedures.

LIZ MATHEW: In the recent past, we have seen Solicitor General Ranjit Kumar and NITI Aayog's Arvind Panagariya quit citing personal reasons. Do you think it is difficult to work with the government?

I don't know anything about their situation. I also left for personal reasons. I keep saying it's the best job I ever had. I had a dream boss. These positions are quite delicate. Everyone has to find his or her own way of navigating through challenges.

LIZ MATHEW: We keep hearing about how the Modi government has turned around the economy. Is it really a rosy picture?

In my book, I say there were some major achievements and there were some shortcomings. The two big achievements are the GST, which needs to be improved, and the Bankruptcy Code... The RBI is also doing a lot on the resolution process, for which they deserve a lot of credit. The third big achievement is a kind of new welfarism. The government is providing essential private goods and services especially to the poor using technology. It's not handouts and welfare, it's not primary health and education necessarily; it is about providing toilets, cooking gas, rural housing, power, medical care. This is what I would say is quite distinctive about this government.

KRISHN KAUSHIK: One of the promises made by this government was the creation of two crore jobs. Do you think job growth has been satisfactory?

There is really no hard basis for making any claims about employment. The latest data available is from 2011. All data released post 2011 has some major methodological difficulty to be considered reliable... I have always said that the reason the employment issue keeps coming up is that, during the boom period, three sectors did very well -- agriculture, construction and IT. These three job creators have not been doing well.

KRISHN KAUSHIK: The recently released back series data lowered the GDP growth rates for a major part of the UPA era. Do you trust the credibility of the data?

I am not a statistician and I haven't looked at the data. But if you look at a variety of indicators in that period -- exports, credit, capital inflow, investment, corporate profits -- they were much higher. Despite all this, if we are saying that GDP growth is the same, it invites a lot of questions. It is not something one can easily accept at face value. We don't want to be in a situation where every time data comes out, our institutions get so discredited that we start doubting every number. The only solution is that we must have experts -- because it's a very technical exercise -- and only institutions with experts should adjudicate this and come out with a verdict.

Bani Kinkar Pattanayak: One of the reasons for Urjit Patel resigning as RBI chief was said to be the government's decision to invoke Section 7 of the RBI Act, which allows it to issue directions to the RBI.

I don't know if Section 7 was invoked or not, but I do think when you take extreme measures, it has the serious risk of compromising the independence of an institution that is so revered and respected like the Indian RBI. That being said, I think we should also be mindful -- and I say this in my book -- that the RBI also needs to be held accountable for a lot of things. I think it seriously underestimated the magnitude of the NBFCs' problem, for example. We have had googlies coming out of nowhere like IL&FS, which clearly should not have happened.

Sandeep Singh: How do you see the trend of political parties announcing debt waivers? Do you see that as a challenge to the economy and the banking system?

Loan waivers are very inefficient and not a very good instrument to achieve agricultural objectives. Even if you can't achieve those objectives by improving productivity, there are much better ways of providing a push -- Direct Benefit Transfers (DBT), the Telangana Rythu Bandhu scheme, for instance -- that don't carry the perverse incentives of loan waivers, which penalise those who don't borrow at all from the formal system. Second, it penalises those who borrow and repay. But I do think that when states are promising this, at least in principle, the Centre has control... (They can say) 'You'll face fiscal constraints, we control how much borrowing you can do, if you have to give a loan waiver, you still have to meet the fiscal deficit by legislation since you have to cut something else'. That's a way of saying that you have to bear the political cost of that. So loan waivers are a problematic, inefficient, very perverse way of achieving agricultural objectives.

Aanchal Magazine: Earlier, the transfer of RBI's surplus reserves was done once a year. Then the demands for interim transfers came in. Won't this become a habit, with governments dipping into the RBI's reserves? Where does one draw the line?

Are there surplus reserves? Unambiguously, there are. If you apply international practice on how much should be the optimal reserves -- and that's what we did in the recent EPW paper -- it is clear that there are excess reserves. But what do you do about the political policy question? Because it is unusual, it (transfer of reserves) should be used very carefully. When I said it should only be used for recapitalisation of banks, that captures the spirit that you can't do this again and again and you can do it only for things that can have important long-run consequences. Recapitalisation of banks is like an investment in the financial system. Also, I think it should be done cooperatively and not unilaterally. As I say in the book as well, look at what, all over the world, especially after the global financial crisis, distinguished central banks -- European Central Bank (ECB), Fed Reserves -- did. They said the global financial crisis is very unusual, we're going to deploy the central bank balancesheet in order to address these one-off problems. My quibble with the RBI is, why did it never voluntarily say that? Why didn't it say at some point in time that we have a strong balance sheet and we volunteer to put the RBI balance sheet to solve the financial-sector problem, of course only under certain conditions. Then there would be no question of the government raiding the RBI.

What I would like all of you to ponder upon is think of it the other way, not about the government raiding the RBI, but how perhaps the RBI could have behaved differently.

Sumit Jha: Back to the GST, was the budget estimate too ambitious? The average monthly collection is falling short by Rs 15,000 crore.

If the budget is demanding something much higher of the GST, then you would kind of infer that maybe the budget got ahead of what were the underlying conditions of the economy. So it's a bit unfair to blame the GST revenue for targets that were set in the budget. I don't think the GST revenue is doing that badly.

Bani Kinkar Pattanayak: Do you think the RBI board should be empowered to have a more proactive role or should the decision-making process be left to the RBI management?

My sense is that the board is meant to give overall guidance and not get involved in all kinds of details.

Ravish Tiwari: What proportion of the current balance sheet mess would you attribute to the UPA and how much to the current government?

For that, you need to look at numbers carefully, in terms of actual timing, loan by loan. I don't think anyone has done that calculation. I would say (the problem) is predominantly legacy and a smaller proportion of it is new, but it's impossible to say whether it's 70-30, 80-20, 60-40. As I say in the book, the original sin for the twin balance sheet problem was the excessive lending that took place in the boom years. How much was then and how much later, it really would be impossible to say.

RAVISH TIWARI: As an economist, you have followed how countries have grown, you study and teach economic history, you know as much history as the new RBI Governor knows economics. Do you think you're eligible to be chairman of the Indian Council of Historical Research?

Just as I said statistics should be done by experts, if I was offered the chairmanship of ICHR, a) I shouldn't be offered the job; b) if I was offered, I shouldn't accept it; and c) if I accept it, you should write columns saying this guy is the pits.

P Vaidyanathan Iyer: Is there a possibility of India becoming a welfare state -- not just at the federal level, but smaller provincial levels? What happens to reforms then?

We should remind ourselves that we've always been a welfarist country. I think we're a wonderful democracy, of course, but that means there will always be pressures to redistribute. The challenge for us is to find efficient ways of redistributing. Subsidies is a very inefficient way of doing that. There are all kinds of price controls and that creates problems. I think we should be thinking of non-distorting ways, with things like Universal Basic Income and DBT as ways of the future."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: A farmer couple cultivates land near Udaipur in Rajasthan. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: Farmers in Rajawas village in Jaipur district. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients crowd a makeshift clinic in Patna in Bihar. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients await their turn for free tests at the primary health centre in Bharoti village in Rajasthan. (Photo: Ranjan Rahi)

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is planning to come up with a 'sandbox' policy to support development of financial technologies for the capital market, Chairman Ajay Tyagi said here on Thursday.

Mr. Tyagi said he also felt that blockchain technology may pose challenge to exchanges and depositories.

""We will come out with a sandbox policy. We are examining whether any changes in laws are required in terms of its dispensation, which may be needed when you try to have a sandbox and allow an activity which otherwise needs registration that the Act may not provide,"" Mr. Tyagi said on the sidelines of the 8th India Finance Conference organised by the Indian Institutes of Management at Calcutta, Bangalore and Ahmedabad. A sandbox approach denotes the trial of a concept before final adaptation, thus minimising the impact of any failure.

Mr. Tyagi said the capital market regulator was also contemplating whether something new could be tried without having to bring in any legislative changes.

He said that technology experts felt that machine learning/artificial intelligence and blockchain were two significant changes that would fundamentally alter the shape of capital markets.

""They have made inroads in the area of high frequency and algorithmic trading and some bits of fund management as well. Going ahead, they would find increasing applications in areas of capital market that require rapid data and information processing,"" he said.

However, blockchain technology, with all its inherent advantages, may pose serious challenge to centralised record keeping institutions such as exchanges, depositories and other entities related to payments and settlement. Pointing out that trust was the backbone of finance, the SEBI chief said that public trust in functioning of financial markets had of late declined due to some financial reporting scandals.

Creating and maintaining trust in the system should be the shared objective of accounting firms, rating agencies, market intermediaries, board and management of public companies and financial institutions, he said.

Mr. Tyagi also said that the regulator would soon come out with a circular on the terms and conditions that would govern mutual funds that wanted to separate their stressed assets. ""Bad and toxic assets should be separated from healthy ones, so that there is less redemption pressure,"" he said. This move is linked to the IL&FS crisis and the blow to the NBFC sector, which has exposed MFs to illiquid debt instruments. It is also aimed at protecting the retail investors whose redemption value gets affected due to these bad assets.

Mr. Tyagi felt that the Indian capital market's performance compared favourably with other major global economies, and the return of Nifty had increased by around 5.8 % in the current fiscal (up to December 15, 2018) compared to the almost neutral return in Dow Jones.

The Indian market's volatility at 12% is among the lowest compared to the U.S., China, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Brazil. The Indian rupee's depreciation at around -10.4 %, compared with the - 9 % of China and the Euro, was better than the U.K. and Brazilian currencies' performance, he said."
