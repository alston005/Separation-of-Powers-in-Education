Pronouncing its verdict, the court held that absence of a Delhi address proof is not a valid ground to deny admission to children into the city's schools.

Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, a government school in Anand Vihar in Delhi had reportedly denied admission to kids who could not produce their permanent residence proof of the national capital.

However, Justice C Hari Sankar on Tuesday (18 December) has directed the school to grant admission to the three children who live in Ghaziabad.

The father of the three children had approached the High Court pleading that the school denied admission to his kids on the ground that they did not have a residence proof of Delhi.

The petition further stated that refusal of admissions is ""arbitrary, discriminatory, illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of fundamental rights"".

""The Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya is at a distance of 2-3 km from their residence and there is no justification not to grant admission to wards of my client merely on the ground that they are not residents of Delhi In case they were not allowed to attend classes in any other government school nearby in the academic year 2018-19, their studies would suffer badly,"" the petition said."

The state cabinet, on Wednesday, approved a proposal to bring changes to the rules, making it mandatory for parents to approach neighbourhood government schools before applying for an RTE seat in private schools in the area.

The present rules under the RTE Act have no such conditions and children of the weaker sections who are admitted to private schools are eligible for the RTE fee reimbursement irrespective of existence of government schools in the neighbourhood of 5 km radius.

Under the proposed amendment, the child would be eligible for a RTE fee reimbursement from a private school only if there is no government school in the neighbourhood or if the child has failed to get a seat in the government school, Parliamentary Affairs minister Krishna Byre Gowda said while briefing the reporters on cabinet decisions.

Defending the decision, Byre Gowda said, ""Presently, the government is reimbursing the fee for all the students under RTE seats. This has, in a way, further hampered the functioning of government schools and is defeating the resolve of the government to improve enrolment and standards in government schools. Now, under the proposed amendment, parents can approach for RTE seats in private schools only after approaching the government school in the neighbourhood. They will get automatic RTE benefit if there is no government school in the neighbourhood.""

""Presently, we are neglecting the government schools. This should change. We need to improve the enrolment and standard of education in government schools,"" Gowda said. The state government is presently reimbursing Rs 11,200 per student annually under the RTE Act.

Free education for girls in govt colleges

The state cabinet on Wednesday cleared the proposal to offer fee reimbursement for girl students in government pre-university, degree and postgraduate colleges. Siddaramaiah, during his tenure, had announced free education for all girls till post graduation. The budget proposal would be implemented from the current academic year itself and the students who have already paid the fee would get the reimbursement. It would cost Rs 95 crore for the exchequer and about 3.17 lakh girl students in government PU, degree and PG colleges, Byre Gowda said."

The apex court had earlier asked petitioner 'Akhil Delhi Prathmik Shikshak Sangh', a registered society, to give a representation to the Centre on implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, also known as RTE.

Refusing to monitor the RTE implementation in the country, a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, ""Don't expect miracles. India is a huge, huge country. Priorities are many and certainly, education is one of the priorities.

The bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph, took note of the fact that the Centre has given the response after taking note of the representation.

""Heard counsel for the petitioner and perused the relevant material. We are not inclined to interfere. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed,"" it noted in the order.

It had earlier asked senior lawyer Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the organisation, to give representation to the Centre and had said that the government would ""assist the court with regard to the implementation"" of the RTE.

The apex court had also asked the Centre to apprise it of decision taken on the issue.

However, it today declined further hearing on the PIL.

The teachers' body, in its PIL, had sought implementation of the right to education of children aged between six to 14 years.

The plea had said the children are suffering as government schools are shutting down and around 9.5 lakh posts of teachers are vacant in these schools.

It had referred to reports ""showing systematic and widespread violations of children's right to education across the country, including violations of numerous specific requirements of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

The petition had said that according to data, there were 14,45,807 government and registered private schools imparting elementary education in the country and as on 2015-16, there were approximately 3.68 crore children who were not in school.

It had sought a direction to all the states and UTs to identify the children, as mandated under the RTE Act, within six months to ascertain as to how many of them should be brought in the formal schooling system.

The plea had also sought a direction to identify ""all schools whether government, private, aided or unaided"" which did not have proper infrastructure such as ""all-weather building with at least one classroom for every teacher, barrier-free access, separate toilets for boys and girls, teaching staff and teaching learning material (TLM).

It had asked for a direction ""to ensure that unaided private primary recognised schools admit the children of economically weaker section (EWS) category in their first level to the tune of 25 per cent quota as enshrined in the RTE Act"".

According to them, the introduction of 'unnecessary changes', as opposed to the needed reforms is only going to slow down the admission process.

This comes after the state government recently released a government resolution (GR) for admissions under the 25 per cent Right to Education (RTE) quota, laying down a number of new norms like inclusion of a first come, first served (FCFS) round, a mandate for private schools to review Aadhaar details before admissions, etc.

Prior to this, the admission procedure had a total of four regular admission rounds. However, the GR has now revised the process with three regular admission rounds and an FCFS round post that. The changes will be applied across all schools in the state from the academic year 2019-20.

Responding to the change, Sharad Javadekar, convenor of akhil Bharatiya samajwadi adhyapak sabha and founder of RTE action committee, said, ""This will hardly make any difference to the students who are still trying to get the deserved seat, despite all the delay in the last phase. Also, the core problem was never the number of rounds, but the lack of proactive implementation and the bureaucracy. Both will remain the same with or without FCFS, it will end up being yet another so-called reform on paper.""

On the mandate for Aadhaar details, he said, ""The reform is ideally supposed to be student-friendly. But, with this clause, they have put yet another obstacle for the needy students, many of who might not have an Aadhaar card in first place. This will give many schools yet another opportunity to deny them the education they deserve."" This mandate stands in contradiction to the statement of the Supreme Court in September, which had clarified that Aadhaar is not a must for school children.

Jagrutti Dharmadhikari president of independent English school association (IESA) and principal of saraswati bhuvan English school, said, ""Firstly, these students are being sent by government post authentication, then why to add another level of authentication of Aadhaar, which the Supreme Court has already stated against.""

The GR further mandates education officers to visit schools to check audit records and ensure that all details like basic facilities and school fees in mentioned on the government portal SARAL, before paying funds as per the reimbursement claims.

Dharmadhikari is one of the school principals who have been resisting against the RTE process for the delay in the payment of reimbursements. ""All the schools have already uploaded all the details on systematic administrative reforms for the achievement of learning by students (SARAL), then what is the need for another stage of inspection. This is nothing but a ploy for further delay."""

The law provides a 25% quota to the underprivileged in unaided schools barring those run by minority bodies. But does it make education more inclusive? Since 2014-15, implementing agency BMC has recorded a steady rise in applications from families aspiring for a better standard of teaching for their children.

In fact, applications have soared almost 500% between then and now. But proportion of admissions secured to applications received continues to be stubbornly low. When BMC first began offering seats in 2014-15 with an online lottery, admissions were at 1,069 against a total 1,930 applicants. This number rose to 3,214 in the current year against 11,358 applications, indicating a widening gap between demand and supply. ""Over the years, we have made efforts to ensure awareness about seats.

Videos, advertisements and posters and notices in school premises are now a norm. We have also reached out to schools and when re

quired, issued notices to ensure they admit students allotted to them. But there is a demand-supply mismatch due to the popularity of select schools,"" said Mahesh Palkar, education officer, BMC. Disparate standards of schools

across city wards and lack of quality institutions around poorer localities are reasons impeding the process. For instance, Dharavi and Govandi throw up a large number of candidates, but finding good schools for them is a challenge.

""We see over 500 applications for a particular school that has only 50 seats. On the other hand, we have schools, especially vernacular medium which do not receive applications,"" said Palkar. This year, of 347 schools, 68 received no applications. Experts feel the class divide is also a key factor which influences mindsets, thereby affecting implementation. ""There continues to be a fear of discrimination among those availing the quota. It will be sometime before this can change.

Also, only tuition fees are reimbursed and parents are expected to shell out other expenses. In a private school, these costs are high and unaffordable to many,"" said Farida Lambay, co-founder, NGO Pratham. The cost of free education is a burden on both schools and parents. Schools do not receive fee reimbursements for years, making the welfare measure difficult for them to fulfil. As for the students, many drop out of private institutions unable to pay for books, uniform, and other expenses on time. ""The better way to ensure free and compulsory education would be to strengthen existing government and aided schools,"" said Hemangi Joshi, an RTE activist in the state."

The department has proposed the Kerala model in which priority will be given to government-run schools to fill seats under RTE rather than private unaided schools.

""The Kerala model gives top priority to filling seats in government-run schools, next come aided schools and third priority is to private unaided schools,"" explained a senior official from the department. The official confirmed sending the proposal to the state government to be placed before the next cabinet meeting for approval.

Officials said there were two main reasons for this proposal to amend the rules: Seats remaining vacant in government-run schools as parents of children, under the RTE rules, preferred sending them to private schools rather than government-run schools; and the financial burden on the state government in refunding the cost to private unaided schools which spend on kids admitted under the RTE quota. ""RTE refund is a burden of Rs 1,200 crore every year for the state government. Not just that, this is impacting admissions in government schools, which is drastically going down since the last three years,"" said a senior official.

""It is also a fact that the state government is helping some private schools sustain as they are getting admissions only because of the RTE Act where kids are getting admission under the 25% reservation quota,"" said the official.

Meanwhile, poor infrastructure in government schools is also being blamed for the poor rate of admissions. One education expert said on condition of anonymity, ""One can't blame the RTE Act. The face of government schools will not change by abolishing or amending the RTE Act.""

However, education expert V P Niranjanaradhya said, ""There were some errors in the implementation (of the RTE Act) itself and bringing amendments to the rules is the best way to correct it. As per Section 3 of the Act, it is a must to admit kids in neighbourhood schools, but it is being violated.

""There are 15.5 lakh schools of which 98.8 per cent are from State boards. Though only 1.2 per cent schools belong to ICSE and CBSE, students from these school fill 78 per cent seats in IITs and 88 per cent in IIMs. If you are not in that privileged one per cent, you have no equal share of the future of the country and this is something we need to look very seriously,"" he said.

Education system in the country at present, the two-time MP said, instead of working as an equalising measure is institutionalising the divide that can never be bridged. Education NPA is nearly Rs 6100 crore, which means youths are not getting jobs. What will youths do with degrees if they cannot get jobs, he asked.

During his talk, he touched upon a wide range of issues from economic and social empowerment, innovation and entrepreneurship to movements that can bring reforms and changes in the society. He cited the 'Me Too' movement which is stirring citizens across the globe to not only speak out but also act.

""It inspired a group of PhD students of Mewat district, one of the poorest areas of the country dominated by minorities, which has the highest illiteracy rate among women in the 10 north Indian States, to start an initiative of making women, aged above 40, literate,"" Gandhi said.

He cited the example of an inefficient patent regime and attributed it to be the major factor inhibiting innovation and enterprise in the country. ""In America it takes six months to get a patent while the process takes six-and-a-half years in India. Further, shockingly, only nine per cent Indian have got patents in the country while 91 per cent have been granted to foreigners"" he stated.

On environmental degradation, he highlighted the case of Bandhwari plant and Musi river. As high as 95 per cent of the population of two villages - Dera and Bandhwari is suffering from cancer because Bandhwari waste treatment plant, the biggest one in Delhi hasn't worked for the last seven years, he said.

It makes people identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute. Our aim is to help the people of the community to learn about their surroundings by keeping them up-to-date along with making them aware about their rights.

My grandmother had responsibilities and she could not take care of the household and the farmland all by herself with the measly resources available.

My dad did not complain, but every morning when he would plough the fields and see kids of his age going to school his heart would churn with a million emotions. He wanted to study and he nestled the fierce desire within him day and night.

One day he finally found the courage and wept in front of his mother as he told her he wanted to be in school. She took a small loan from ahrtiya and took him to the principal of the local government school. After paying the measly fees of a few rupees, he was admitted to school again.

Scholarships all the way

He never forgot the circumstances of the family and worked hard and earned a scholarship. It covered all his expenditure and left some to be saved, out of which he gave some to his mother.

He studied at the Government Mohindra College Patiala, Kurukshetra University and later on at Punjabi University without seeking any monetary help from home.

Throughout his education he went on to win scholarships. He would tell me of a burning desire inside him that prodded him to work harder every single day. This want was created because of lack of resources.

I had a rather comfortable existence and never experienced any financial problems. My daughter gets everything on a platter. Her life is easy and neatly scripted by me with only the happy and rosy moments stashed together. She does not know how it feels to be denied the basic amenities of life. Perhaps all the kids who are mollycoddled and given too much of everything would never realise that though education is a basic fundamental right it eludes so many of their peers.

Life is not easy for them, and competing with kids who have better resources would always be a challenge for them.

No less a mortal

But that does not make them lesser mortals. They look exuberant and enthusiastic. They only have to carve their own identities and find ways to survive amid fierce competition. They might not get enough opportunities but they would have to work hard and create them.

Schools say the problem is that the government has to pay the fees of underprivileged children who have to be given free seats in private schools.

M.R.S.K. Chaitanya, a Right to Education activist, told this newspaper, ""The Right to Education Act promises every child free and compulsory education but the government has not even framed the rules for the implementation of the Act. The government has also failed to implement many provisions of the Act even four years after the formation of the state.""

He says that none of the schools is following the RTE Act as the state government has not formed the required rules. Howe-ver, the Hyderabad Public School has partially impl-emented the law by providing 25 per cent seats to underprivileged kids,

""When the CAG pulled up the state government, the silly reason officials gave was that they don't have enough funds to imp-lement the RTE Act. I urge the government to immediately form the state advisory council and implement the Act,"" he said.

Educationist N. Narayana pointed out that Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao had said in the Assembly on March 21, 2016 that ""The RTE Act is disastrous"" and declared that it would not be implemented in Telangana. He was a member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) when the RTE Act was passed.

""The problem is that the government has to pay the fees of underprivileged students who have to be given free seats. The government has therefore fixed a very nominal fee. Schools will have to compensate the amount they will be losing from other parents, which would escalate the fees, due to which these parents will get agitated.

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act that does away with the no-detention policy mentioned in the law. The existing policy prohibits schools from detaining students till they complete elementary education. In India, elementary school runs from Class 1 to Class 8.

The amendment says that the states can choose to hold a regular examination either at the end of Classes 5 and 8, or both. Students who fail this test will get additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination within two months of the declaration of the result. If the students still do not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them.

However, if states choose, they can continue the no-detention policy all the way to Class 8. No child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August 2017 and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee presented its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The Right to Education Forum has condemned the bill. Its national convenor, Ambarish Rai, said detaining students would have ""adverse consequences"".

""The consequence of detaining a child in the same class works adversely on the child's psyche and has an deep impact on his or her self-esteem,"" Rai said. ""It is a very unfortunate move which will impact all children, particularly those belonging to most marginalised communities.""

The Social Research and Development Foundation, a Bihar-based non-governmental organisation, also criticised the passage of the bill. ""If children are not learning at school and the answer of the government is to hold them back and ultimately push them out, that is a very wrong policy decision,"" it tweeted. ""It can only be hoped that states will not make use of it. Really wondering that you appreciate it.""

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school to ensure they do not drop out. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year."

With the Lok Sabha's announcement to pass the bill to amend India's most important law on school education to scrap 'No Detention Policy' in schools, now the experts have shared their opinion on the same.

The bill which has been passed is 'The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Second Amendment) Bill, 2017'.

According to this policy, if the child fails in Class 5 or Class 8 or both, he or she shall be given an additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time.

Experts criticize amendment under RTE act

However, on the recent news of scrapping it, the experts have criticized the decision. According to them, removing this policy will weaken the entire Right to Education Act. Here's what they feel:

Scrapping the 'No Detention Policy' will undermine the provision of admitting children in age-appropriate classes.

Repeating classes will result in more dropouts

As per the report of Scroll.in, the activists also added that making children repeat classes could force the most marginalized and economically deprived among them to drop out.

Here's what Professor at School of Education, Tata Institute of Social Sciences said to Scroll.in:

""The new amendment contradicts another fundamental promise of the Right to Education Act: to provide a system that makes the child free of fear, trauma, and anxiety,'' said Disha Nawani.

Amendment to RTE act to harm the main provisions under it

Experts believe that the changes in the current Right to Education Act will jeopardize the main provisions which are as follows:

Section 29(2): Curriculum and evaluationSection 30(1): Board examsSection 4: Age-appropriate admissionSection 12(1)(c): Economically weak children in private schools

On Wednesday, the Lok Sabha passed a bill to amend India's most important law on school education. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Second Amendment) Bill, 2017 removes a foundational provision of the Right to Education Act of 2009: that schools cannot make any child repeat a class until Class 8.

The amendment, to Section 16 of the Act, does away with this restriction - enforced from 2010 and also known as the ""no detention policy"" - and allows states to decide whether to detain children in Class 5 or Class 8, or both.

Activists and educationists contend that the change will inevitably lead to the dilution of other elements of the Right to Education Act, which is meant to back a fundamental right. Elementary education became a fundamental right in 2002.

As the lawyer and activist Khagesh Jha noted, scrapping the no detention policy will undermine the provision of admitting children in age-appropriate classes.

Another provision of the bill prescribing ""a regular examination in the fifth class and in the eighth class at the end of every academic year"" similarly undermines Section 30 of the Right to Education Act, which prohibits board exams for Classes 1 to 8.

""It is like tugging on a yarn until the entire sweater unravels,"" said Ambarish Rai, convenor of the Right to Education Forum, a coalition of non-profit organisations, academics, educationists and child rights experts.

Disha Nawani, who is with the School of Education, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, and Niranjanaradhya, from the Centre for Child and the Law at the National Law School of India University, both said the no detention policy is foundational to the Right to Education Act. The policy, Nawani explained, is meant to ""hold the child in school, undisturbed, for eight years"". ""It was not to ensure children were learning because for that...the Act has [other] provisions,"" she said.

Worryingly, the activists said, making children repeat classes could force the most marginalised and economically deprived among them to drop out. If they do, they will fall beyond the reach of other provisions of the Act and any intervention the central or state governments may devise.

Because the ""whole thing works around the idea of fear"", as Nawani put it, the new amendment contradicts another fundamental promise of the Right to Education Act: to provide a system that makes ""the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

But the potential weakening of the Act is just one problem. Jha foresees children's access to schooling further curtailed by the circulars and directions that education departments are certain to issue to operationalise the amendment. ""The amendment has created the scope for dismantling the Act,"" he said, ""the bureaucracy will do the rest.

Here are some of the main provisions of the Right to Education Act that activists and educationists believe will be jeopardised by the amendment:

Section 29(2): Curriculum and evaluation

Niranjanaradhya described this section as the Right to Education Act's main direction on the quality and the nature of education children must have. It directs the ""academic authority"" of the Centre and states to devise curriculum and evaluation procedures that advance the ""all-round development of the child"", ensure a child is ""free of fear, trauma and anxiety"", and introduce ""comprehensive and continuous evaluation of child's understanding of knowledge and his or her ability to apply the same"".

A reset to the old system of a year-end examination that could result in detention contradicts each of these objectives, Niranjanaradhya argued. ""The idea is to create enabling conditions for learning and it is the responsibility of the state to provide them,"" he said. ""The state has not performed its duty - less than 10% schools are fully RTE Act-compliant - and is now replacing progressive reforms with a gurukul system.""

The policy of ""comprehensive continuous evaluation"" is especially at risk. It had replaced the annual exam with a system of tracking a child's progress through the year. ""It meant assessments were used for learning, to know where the child is struggling and taking remedial measures,"" Nawani said.

Flawed implementation of this reform has been largely responsible for the hostility to the no detention policy. Activists fear that after today's amendment, comprehensive, continuous evaluation will be abandoned in practice as schools reorient themselves to ready children for tests.

Section 30(1): Board exams

The amendment leaves the decision to detain children to states but insists on ""a regular examination in the fifth class and in the eighth class at the end of every academic year"".

The bill does not elaborate on the nature of the ""regular examination"" - whether it will be conducted by the school or examination bodies - but Nawani believes that it ""means a formal system of examination whatever the pattern of the question paper"".

This contradicts Section 30 of the Right to Education Act which explicitly states that ""no child shall be required to pass any Board examination till completion of elementary education"". Board examinations are conducted by an external agency - an education board - that sets questions and evaluates answers.

In 2009, the Central Board of Secondary Education, the only public board directly under the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, had made the board exam at the end of Class 10 optional for schools affiliated to it. It was reinstated this year.

The Act's ban on board exams in elementary school and insistence on continuous evaluation, Nawani said, were born of the ""recognition of the ill-effects of the public examination"". ""Public exams cause stress but test only a certain kind of ability,"" he added. ""This was the first time there was a concerted effort to address that problem.""

Rajasthan has already introduced public exams in elementary school - for Class 8 in 2015 and Class 5 in 2017. The main difference is that in the Class 5 exam, candidates are awarded an overall grade, not marks.

Section 4: Age-appropriate admission

The Right to Education Act and the fundamental right it supports guarantee free education for children aged 6 to 14.

Jha, who routinely represents children denied admission in the Delhi High Court, said the amendment will complicate the implementation of Section 4 of the Act. It contains directions for admitting children who are out of school or whose education has been interrupted.

Section 4 states:

""Where a child above six years of age has not been admitted in any school or though admitted, could not complete his or her elementary education, then, he or she shall be admitted in a class appropriate to his or her age.""

""What this means is, a struggling fifth grader can be made to repeat a class but a 13-year-old who has never been to school can join Class 8 directly,"" said Jha. ""How can you have these two policies together?""

Section 4 also guarantees that children admitted directly into a higher class will have access to ""special training"" to close the learning gap. ""This was already not being implemented properly and now there will be no incentive to,"" said Ambarish Rai.

Any confusion regarding admissions will also undermine Section 9(d), which requires the local authority to ""maintain records of children up to the age of 14 years residing within its jurisdiction"", Rai added.

Jha pointed out that some states have already started enforcing upper-age limits for admission or writing exams. So, children repeating classes will likely find it difficult to secure admission if they move schools, particularly migrant children even though Section 9(k) enjoins local authorities to ""ensure admission of children of migrant families"".

Section 12(1)(c): Economically weak children in private schools

This provision requires private schools not aided by state governments to ""admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25% of the strength of that class, children belonging to the weaker section and disadvantaged group in the neighbourhood and provide free and compulsory elementary education till its completion"". For this, they are compensated by the state.

Both Niranjanaradhya and Jha believe that this set of children, belonging to poor families and marginalised groups such as Dalits and Adivasis, will suffer as a result of the amendment. ""Many private schools make these kids repeat classes as soon as they graduate Class 8 because they want them to leave,"" said Jha. ""Now they can keep the child in Class 5 till they turn 14 and compel parents to withdraw the child. This will make it very easy for private schools to push the children under EWS [Economically Weaker Sections] quota out."""

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed a bill to amend the Right to Education (RTE) that abolishes the 'no detention policy' in schools. Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that while the no detention policy has been done away with, it will be at the discretion of the states whether or not to continue with it. He further said that from now on, the states will decide at what level and who will conduct the examination.

Replying to a debate in the Lower House on The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (second amendment) Bill, 2017, Javadekar said that the current educational system is broken and we need to fix it. The Minister said that the ""education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education"".

""The current provisions under the Right to Education Act state that no student till class 8th can be detained and they will be promoted to the next grade without any problem.""

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, he further said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability to our elementary education system.""

While talking about the reason behind abolishing the 'no detention policy', Javadekar, according to a PTI report said that this bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools. He further added that the policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school. He added that the bill provides for a regular examination in classes 5 and 8 and if the child fails, he or she shall be given an additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time.

While talking about the need for more accountable staff, Javadekar said that teacher training, quality and accountability are most important. He added that there was no shortages of teachers, however, the deployment of teachers was not right.

The bill was supported by Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC. While talking about the education system, Roy said that children often do not study if there are no exams and the education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy."

Activists allege govt, schools and education officials are trying to scuttle right to education of poor; city DEO data says RTE allotment in 107 schools less than 30% against intake capacity raising questions over the RTE admission process

Delay in resuming second round of RTE admissions raises a stink. While parents of 56,589 students eagerly wait for it, the State government has expressed inability to start second round saying more than 300 schools -- claiming to be minority institutes -- have obtained stay from the court.

Even as various stakeholders continue to fight it out in the court, Ahmedabad District Education Officer (DEO) data of 687 schools reveals that there are 374 schools which have been allotted RTE students only in single digits. There are 107 schools where less than 30% RTE seats have been allotted against the intake strength. The situation in some of the top schools of Ahmedabad is striking (See table below).

Delhi Public School, Bopal, has a quota (intake) of 100 RTE students but has been allotted only nine students this year. Similarly, Asia English School has been allotted only 24 students against quota of 50. It had no RTE student last year. Another reputed school, Udgam School for Children, was allotted only 15 students last year against quota of 83. This year, it has been allotted 53 students.

There are 1,25,784 approved seats for RTE in the state and only 72,294 students have been allotted schools in the first round of which 3,097 applications have been rejected. In all, 56,589 applicants that are eligible for RTE admissions are yet to be allotted schools.

What activists say

RTE activists allege that certain school managements and government are hand-in-glove to scuttle the right of poor to quality education.

RTE activist Mujahid Nafees said, ""The government is just giving an excuse that minority schools have obtained stay on the proceedings. The government can always start RTE admission in schools other than the 300 odd schools claiming minority status. We have been fighting the opaque RTE admission process for years.""

He alleged, ""The government has succumbed to pressure from private schools to allot them less RTE students"".

Another RTE activist Sandip Munjyasara said: ""The government can keep aside RTE admissions in the 300 schools that are claiming minority status. However, nothing should stop it from going ahead with RTE admissions in rest of the schools.""

What educationists say

Schools put the blame on the 'bad lot' among them. A principal wishing to stay anonymous said, ""Certain schools enter into an 'arrangement' with the DEO so that they have to absorb lesser number of RTE students. In fact, there are schools that have not been allotted even a single RTE student. How is it possible? For every RTE admission, the state government pays the school only Rs 10,000 even if the fee for regular student is more than Rs 1 lakh. The schools then pass the fee burden on parents of regular students.""

Raja Pathak, Director of Sattva Vikas School, said, ""Several seats go vacant in some schools as there are not enough RTE applications in the locality where they are situated. We have intake of only 6 seats as we have only one division with 24 students.""

Lamiya Shums, Director of Anand Niketan School, Shilaj, said, ""Density of population and demography determine the allocation of RTE seats besides the personal choice of parents. If 5 schools near their residence are shown in the Google map, obvious choice of parents would be to select the one that is near their residence.""

Manan Choksi, Executive Director of Ugdam School, said, ""We have admitted students under RTE allotted to us and we have also asked for more students in the remaining quota.""

For Zebar School, Choksi added, ""We have 10 seats vacant in Class 1 after accommodating RTE students. Also, we are not getting regular admission applications as the academic year has started. If RTE quota is not filled up, it will be a double whammy for us as we will neither get fee reimbursement from the government nor fee from normal admissions. This is a criminal wastage of seats.""

What education officials say

The DEO and District Primary Education Officer (DPEO) justify the large number of vacant seats to ""choice-based allocation"". Mahesh Mehta, DPEO, said, ""The allocation depends on choice of parents and geography. There's nothing more to it."" Navneet Mehta, DEO (City), said, ""Parents usually go for schools that have a reputation. For example, in Paldi area which has allotment capacity of only 30 students we received 1,800 applications. The key issue is selection made by parents and not whether less or more students are allotted admission in certain schools.""

But without being too critical it can be safely said that all these changes have so far not been able to improve the standard of education in our country. Rather, the changes have created an air of uncertainty among the students. Students are virtually clueless about their future. They do not know what changes will come next and what will happen to their career plan? For example, students of various central universities are still agitating over the reduction of seats for M. Phil and PhD. As usual, students of Delhi's Jahwarlal Nehru University (JNU) were at the forefront of this agitation. So, it was easy for the authorities to claim that those students were not at all interested in their studies and that they were only interested in occupying the seats to pursue their political careers. But the explanation did not answer the moot question. What will happen to those students who are eligible to continue their studies further after obtaining Master degrees but would not be able do so because the universities have suddenly reduced the intake of students? Are there any alternatives for them? The authorities have no answer.

The authorities will not be able to answer these questions as these decisions were taken more to satisfy their own egos rather than keeping the need of our education system in mind. As a matter of fact the authorities have failed to realise that education system in our country needs a total overhauling from primary to the highest level. Effecting changes in one segment ignoring the problems of other sectors will further weaken the system. There should be comprehensive policy to make education meaningful. Adequate number of teachers and a common syllabus for students all over the country are the need of the day. Further, it is time to think whether education should be on the concurrent list or not as this is creating more problems than solutions. For example, recently the Centre has announced that history of emergency will become part of the curriculum soon. But the Centre was not the only one to do so. Few years ago the West Bengal government included Singur Movement in curriculum. Many other state governments have also burdened the students by including their favourite topics in the syllabus taking advantage of education being in the concurrent list. As there is common syllabus, when a student enters into national level, on most occasions, he or she will have to start afresh as the syllabus he or she followed was completely different.

In such a scenario, steps should be taken to remove the flaws prevailing in our education system. Cosmetic measures such as replacing UGC by another body will serve no purpose. At the same time disparities between in Central and state universities should be removed. It should be ensured that quality teachers are available in all the educational institutions. Only then Right to Education will become meaningful."

Pvt schools demanding money for books, uniforms: Parents

Youth for Better India, an NGO, has approached the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) for restoration of right to education to about 100 children from underprivileged sections, whose school inside a park site has been given eviction notices by GHMC authorities.

The Commission has reportedly issued notices to the Hyderabad district administration and GHMC Commissioner seeking their reports by July 31.

According to the details that were published by The Hindu on April 3 this year, the 'Alpha School', a philanthropic initiative by a woman, has been functioning since 1999, imparting education to children from poor background living in surrounding areas.

Initially located in a slum near road no. 22 at Jubilee Hills, the school was evicted along with other slum dwellers as the site was earmarked for a park. Later, the school was shifted to a footpath outside the park and the children continued attending the classes.

Security concerns

In 2015, the school faced eviction from the footpath too, owing to security concerns involving the passage of the convoy of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.

New school

When protests were conducted against the eviction, the then State Commission for Protection of Child Rights intervened and asked the district administration and the School Education Department to provide alternative schooling facility for the children, by admitting them in the nearest government school and providing them transportation facilities.

It also suggested to the State government to construct a new school with the necessary infrastructure in a nearest available land.

The orders were never implemented, and the school yet again occupied a spot inside the site allotted for the park. The GHMC officials recently asked the woman, G. Shobha, who runs the school, to vacate the premises so that the site can be used for the purpose it was meant for.

Youth for Better India, which is a collective of professionals from different platforms, visited the site and took the issue to the notice of the SHRC, claiming that the right to education of about 100 children is being violated."

Many of them have not received a single rupee even after three years and are forced to borrow money to sustain education of their sons and daughters.

A DEO official claimed there's not enough grant to give assistance to every parent while an NGO warned that government apathy can lead to rise in drop out of kids studying under RTE. State Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama maintained, ""Issues pertaining to RTE were discussed twice in the Vidhan Sabha. But we have not come across any case of parents not receiving assistance.

However, I will get the details and see if there are such cases. Also, we will immediately address the matter if parents write to us.""

When Rs 3,000 makes a huge difference

Yasmin Ajmeri, whose daughter studies in Class 4 at Model English School, Juhapura, said, ""We had opened a bank account where the government assistance could be deposited directly. However, due to zero balance the account has been closed. I have not received Rs 3,000 even once.

But not anymore. While education is free, I have been borrowing money to purchase books and uniform.""

We were informed that the money is deposited two months after the school starts. Maybe it's our fault for not checking with the government officials.""

Jitendra Parmar, whose daughter studies in an Ambawadi school and will now come in class 3, said, ""I have not received any incentive. While the school says they have already sent the report to the DEO office, officials there claim they have not received it. I have visited the DEO office number of times but there's no solution yet.

We are thankful for free education but for people like us Rs 3,000 is a huge amount. What is the point of free education when the government fails to provide assistance on time?""

'Drop out cases may rise'

Sanjida Shaikh, who coordinates with RTE parents and works for NGO SAATH, said, ""In the first place, it's difficult to convince parents to admit their children under RTE. We bring them around by telling them that besides free education, the government takes care of other needs like uniform, books by providing financial aid.

There are possibly two ways to transform RTE into truly a right to education.

First is by instantly increasing the available seats, and second by doing away with the limit of 25 per cent reservation and moving to a system of education vouchers.

India's right to education law, officially titled as the right of children to free and compulsory education act, 2009 (henceforth RTE), doesn't necessarily give children the right to education. It rather guarantees them the right to lottery and if they are lucky enough, they might get admitted in a school of their choice.

The RTE act mandates that 25 per cent of the seats in private unaided non-minority schools are reserved for free for children from a) economically weaker sections (children of parents with income less than X where X varies from state to state and (b) disadvantaged groups such as Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes or other groups so defined by the respective state governments.

Why one calls the RTE primarily a law that guarantees the right to lottery and not necessarily education? Look no further than the latest round of school admissions that are currently underway throughout the country for 2018-19 academic session.

In Mumbai, 347 schools that qualify under the RTE act have received 10,628 applications for 8,374 RTE seats. In Nashik, 466 schools have got 10,416 applications for 6,589 seats. In Pune, 933 schools have received a whopping 42,108 applications for just 16,422 seats. In Aurangabad, 11,121 applications for 6,371 seats. In Nagpur, 23,631 applications for 6,985 seats and so on. This is just in Maharashtra.

In Karnataka, last year, 11,917 schools that come under the ambit of the RTE act received over two lakh applications for 1,29,165 seats. In Rajasthan, which boasts of highest admissions under RTE, 33,091 private schools have reported receiving 11 lakh applications but only 2,62,000 students only got the admission as only this many seats were available with schools under the 25 per cent quota. Same thing transpired in Uttar Pradesh where number of applications (21,789) far exceeded the quantum of available seats (15,626).

Every year, the situation is becoming more precarious. The numbers of applications are increasing at a much higher rate than the private schools' capacity to accommodate them. In some cities like Pune and Nagpur, the problem is becoming critical as a number of applications are more than two or three times the available seats.

The cheerleaders of the RTE have been telling us how it guarantees the right to education for every child in the 6-14 age group irrespective of their social and economic status. It is now becoming clear that the act only gives the children the right to lottery which may or may not help them eventually get a seat in a private school.

One is reminded of an emotionally charged scene from a Bollywood movie Hindi Medium where a kid after failing to get admission via RTE lottery apologises to his father for being unlucky, hearing which, the latter breaks into tears. As is evident from the data, the scene must be an every year reality for lakhs of parents. To further understand the complexities involved in the RTE admissions, it's pertinent to understand how lottery system works and how admissions take place.

The lottery logic varies from state to state. Some have a centralised draw of lots, some conduct the lottery at district level for all schools that fall in that area and some states do it in schools themselves under the supervision of a government official. The underlying logic is same: if the number of RTE applications for a school are less than available seats, then everybody gets admission, but if applications exceed the number of seats, then a lottery is conducted to select the students.

The reason why poor parents treat this lottery process as life and death issue is because it only happens at nursery or first grade level. Once your child is admitted, he will study in the school for free till he completes elementary education. If he misses out due to fate, then too bad. A child usually gets two to three shots at lottery and once he is more than six years old, he becomes ineligible even to apply for the lottery. That's why the stakes are so high. Many parents even falsify age data out of desperation as they understand how important good education is for upward mobility.

By continuing with such an obviously mindless policy, we are digging ourselves deeper into a hole. What's the way out? Well there are two possible tweaks that can solve the current crisis and transform the RTE into truly a right to education, not just a right to lottery.

First is by instantly increasing the available seats. This can be done by making RTE applicable to minority-run schools as well, which are currently exempted from the ambit of the act. Incidentally, the problem of oversubscribing of RTE seats is happening mostly in major metros where minority schools are big players. If these are also thrown open to students from poor backgrounds, it will go a long way in solving problem of seat crunch. However, it is only a temporary solution.

Second is by doing away with this arbitrary limit of 25 per cent altogether and move to a system of education vouchers. Any needy student can then approach the school of his choice, get admission and pay by vouchers given by the government. Schools in turn can submit the vouchers with the government and get reimbursed. However, they should be able to get their dues before the end of each academic year failing which the child wouldn't be allowed to continue in the school. This would also act as a pragmatic political pressure point for governments so that they behave and pay in time unlike in the current system where many haven't paid dues to private schools for years.

However, given the governments' proclivity for transferring responsibilities to others, what is likely to happen is that the 'no skin in the game' activists will push the state to increase the current limit of 25 per cent quota in private schools to maybe 49 per cent. Given that this 25 per cent figure is completely arbitrary and a result of someone's epiphany, we shouldn't be surprised if the quota is almost doubled in coming years. Needless to say, this would be akin to culling the golden goose (private schools) to reap all the eggs. But we all know what the solution is: incentivise the goose to keep giving golden eggs."

While SBI has acknowledged the mistake and promised to refund the deducted amount, the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has issued summons to UBI for fining these students and failing to reply to the commission.

""The amount of RTE Act entitlement is like a government scholarship amount and that is an entitlement that no one can take away from the children as it is guaranteed by the Constitution. It's a right of the child,"" said Kanoongo.

According to the child rights body, ""an approximate Rs. 400-800 is given to the economically weaker section (EWS) students for school uniforms. It is this money that the banks have deducted as a fine for not maintaining a minimum balance"".

Kanoongo added that there are almost 19 crore students studying under the RTE till Class VIII. Out of these 19 crore, 38% are enrolled in private schools, which leaves ""almost 11 crore students in government schools"", who have bank accounts in SBI and UBI and are subjected to this wrongdoing by the banks.

According to NCPCR, most of the students, ""whose money was deducted, could not purchase a uniform for this academic year"".

But is there a legal mandate that permits banks to deduct any amount of money citing non-maintenance of minimum balance from bank accounts of children enrolled under the Right to Education Act.

According to NCPCR, such an act by the bank is in complete violation of an RBI circular issued last year.

""Earlier last year, the Reserve Bank of India had issued a circular to not deduct any minimum balance fee from accounts of children below 18 years,"" Kanoongo said.

NCPCR is also set to issue a recommendation to the RBI next week so that ""all bank accounts of children below 18 years are declared to be zero balance accounts"".

Apart from UBI, State Bank of India too was guilty of deducting money from the accounts of students, but has now ""agreed to remedy the error"".

""We had send notices to both UBI and SBI. SBI has now designated officers in each and every district of the country to ensure proper implementation of the disbursal scheme. They have also given us a list of these designated officers and we have shared the list with the state education department and soon these officers will have the concerned bank account numbers and within a months' time, we will transfer the amount that was deducted from the accounts of the students,"" Kanoongo said."

These scholarship accounts were assigned to the children under the Right to Education Act to provide them with school uniform among other things. While SBI has acknowledged the mistake and promised to refund the deducted amount, the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) has issued summons to UBI for fining these students and failing to reply to the commission.

News18 has accessed a copy of the summons where the child rights body mentions the several past reminders it had issued to UBI. Now, the bank is expected to explain its stand on March 6.

""The commission has registered a complaint regarding fine levied on scholarship accounts. The commission has requested you number of times to take swift action in these matters and submit an action taken report. The commission now requires you to appear in person in this matter along with relative records documents on March 6,"" reads the summon letter addressed to the Chairperson of UBI.

The commission has also made it clear that if UBI fails to appear before them on March 6, they would be ""subjected to the consequences of the non-attendance as provided in the procedure of Civil Procedure Code"".

Priyank Kanoongo, RTE & Education member in NCPCR told News18 that the commission chanced upon the wrongdoing while conducting workshops in Maharashtra. An education sub-committee under a zilla gram panchayat brought it to the notice of the commission.

Through this online admission students of weak financial background can study for free in private unaided schools till Class 8.

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25% seats in private unaided schools are reserved for marginalised students. Students of families with an annual income less than Rs 1 lakh can apply for RTE admission. The elementary education of these students (from Class 1 to Class 8) is entirely funded by the state government.

7,449 seats are available for RTE admissions for academic year 2018-19 in 334 private unaided schools of Mumbai. Mahesh Palkar, BMC Education officer who is in charge of RTE admissions, said, ""We will start the online admission process by February 8. Parents can apply online and will have to submit Income Certificate as proof of their yearly income.""

This year, the Income Certificate will be verified thoroughly as the RTE admission website is linked with the Maha portal online. ""We have linked the website to avoid any inconvenience or cheating in the Income Certificate. Students can submit income certificate of guardian or widowed mother while earlier students had to submit certificate of the father only,"" Palkar added.

Parents can chose 10 schools while applying online. In addition, a mobile application and online grievance cell has been created to help parents in the admission process. A parent said, ""We should realise RTE admissions are for those who cannot afford high-end fees. Parents should not fake certificates or documents to avail the benefit of free education."" BMC teachers have also created a video on YouTube to educate parents about the steps involved in the admission and application process."
