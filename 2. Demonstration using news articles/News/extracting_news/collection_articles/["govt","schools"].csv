The decision of Gujarat government to replace traditional 'Yes Sir' or 'Present Sir' norm with 'Jai Hind' and 'Jai Bharat' to be said in response to the roll call in classrooms has gone down well with students and teachers, who say that the move invokes ""the feeling of nationalism and patriotism.""

""By saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' we show our respect to our nation and soldiers, who are guarding our borders. It inspires us to work for the nation,"" said Shivesh Sharma, a student, while talking to ANI.

""The new rule by the government is very inspiring. It makes us feel that the whole day and the whole year will pass happily,"" said Gohail, a student of Class XI.

""When we say 'Jai Hind' and 'Jai Bharat,' we feel that we are doing something for our nation. We have never gone to the borders where our soldiers are protecting our nation but we feel that we are also doing something for our nation as our soldiers are doing,"" said Divya Parmar, Class XI student.

""The latest decision will invoke a feeling of nationalism among students and will bring a new change in the students as they will say 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' daily while responding to their roll call,"" said Bindi Upadhyay, a teacher.

""Nationalism should be taught to everyone from the very childhood so that when they grow up they become citizens, who are dedicated to the cause of nation and national interest,"" further said Mandavia.

A notification regarding the use of Jai Hind and Jai Bharat in the schools of Gujarat was issued by the state government on Monday, which is applicable to the students from Class I to XII.

Then two years ago, all his former students got together and threw a surprise party to celebrate his 85th birthday.

After attending the party, he realized that he could not have earned the love of his wards if he had charged money. He was convinced that coaching athletes for free was indeed the right call though he had very little left in his bank account when he retired.

D'Cruz is an athletics coach who trained for close to 50 years before he quit when he ""could not stand for long enough on the field"".

""I was 80 by then and if I cannot stand, I should not be coaching,"" he said.

Now 87, D'Cruz occasionally guides helpless athletes. As a young man, D'Cruz ran 800m to 1500m, 5000m, 10,000m and the marathon. Now, a walking stick stands incongruously next to him, reminding the octogenarian of his age.

For all the middle and long distance running he did, D'Cruz was always turning out long/triple jumpers, throwers and sprinters. And, yet, he shunned unwanted attention. He stayed away from the limelight and his deeds shone through the wards he coached -- Canute Maghalhaes (sprinter), Jenson Colaco , Nilesh Jadhav, Sushant Bangera (triple jumper) and Dayanand Shetty, who later appeared in the TV serial CID, Jay Shah, who recently won the Inter-university triple jump title with a National record.

""If you have the speed and power in your run and can take off from the board without breaking stride, then you will become a good long/triple jumper,"" explains D'Cruz , making it sound simple.

D'Cruz grew up in Kerala and tried his hand at the middle distances of 800m and 1500m. He even represented his university in the nationals but could not replicate his success at the national level. ""I ran brilliantly for 600m in a 800m race. I had no idea that I had to pace,"" he explains with a chuckle.

After completing college, he joined the NIS Patiala and only after he became a qualified coach did he actually race smart enough to win the double of 800/1500.

""I started winning at the age of 28 and 30. It was surprising. I had the expertise. That's when I realized that I need to become a coach,"" he explains.

He held a state govt job in Bengaluru and then moved to Mumbai and worked with the state govt. His coaching stint bloomed only after his retirement.

He joined the Francis D'Assisi school and helped the institution break the hegemony on Solo schools winning the overall title. For seven years, D'Assisi won the title before their association became acidic.

He then joined St. Lawrence and continued producing champions. And continued until he could no longer stand. ""When I retired, I thought I would die when I reach the age of 70, but here I am,"" says D'Cruz , breaking into a chuckle again.

May his tribe bloom."

The BJP government in Gujarat has asked schools to ensure that students respond with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' during roll call instead of customary 'Yes Sir', which it feels will instill ""a feeling of patriotism"".

The move has drawn flak from opposition parties which said the government should rather work towards improving the ""deteriorating quality of education"".

As per notifications issued Monday (December 31) by the Directorate of Primary Education and Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB), students of class 1-12 of the government, grant-in-aid and self-financed schools will have to respond to attendance call with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat', starting January 1.

The objective of the new practice is to ""foster patriotism among students right from childhood"", the notifications stated.

Defending the move, Gujarat Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said Tuesday that the government should be open to accepting ""good suggestions"".

""'Jai Bharat' and 'Jai Hind' are much better than 'Yes Sir'. Saying 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' creates a feeling of patriotism, which is why I have decided to make the change,"" he told reporters.

The minister said schools affiliated to the CBSE and other boards have also been asked to follow the new guidelines.

""Even local private schools have said that this is a good decision of the state government,"" he claimed.

Criticising the Gujarat government, state Congress unit president Amit Chavda said the new practice ""will not change the quality of education"" in the government and affiliated schools.

""The BJP government has made several efforts to instill patriotism among school students. Altering a certain practice will not improve the standard of education,"" he said.

Chavda alleged that the quality of primary education is going down in Gujarat. ""The quality is even worse than many other under-developed states,"" he said."

As per the scheme, sanitary napkins will be distributed to women aged between 15 and 45 in schools, colleges, anganwadi centres as well as sub-health centres. Bhanwar Singh Bhati of the higher education department told TOI that the proposal was being sent to the government. ""An allocation of Rs 2.5 crore is required."" he further said.

Health and education remain two important areas that need immediate attention in Rajasthan. The measure is a part of the newly elected government- Indian National Congress' 60 day programme where government college education was also made free for girls.

Menstruation still remains a taboo in many states of India, especially in rural areas. Not maintaining proper menstrual hygiene can result in serious infections and health issues among adolescent girls. Absence of or expensive cost of sanitary napkins makes them a luxury for many women residing in backward areas.

Many awareness campaigns have also been organised in the state. Local level village representatives, women self help groups, and corporate organisations have been roped to break eerie silence around this topic among young girls and women.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had announced earlier this year that the content of National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books being taught in schools will be reduced by half in the coming years to ease the burden on students.

Following the announcement, the NCERT constituted a committee to work out where and how the syllabus can be cut, and the panel has now submitted its report to the council.

Sources in the NCERT say that while it is not possible to reduce the syllabus by half, they are working on reducing portions wherever possible.

For the exercise, the HRD ministry had also invited suggestions from the public, with everyone from parents to teachers, and even people interested in the field of education, encouraged to weigh in.

The government received more than one lakh suggestions.

According to sources, while a large number of people said the syllabus should be reduced by 50 per cent, many others suggested a calculated approach not driven by this target.

Some people, meanwhile, suggested increasing the syllabus in some of the subjects, especially science, to bring it on a par with international standards, the sources said.

The NCERT is now studying the suggestions of the panel as well as the public to finalise the cuts.

A comparison of the syllabus for the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (ICSE), which includes some NCERT books, and that of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), where they form the bulk of the curriculum, shows that the latter is anyway lighter.

2. Bhima Koregaon: Before Memorial Day, Fear Under Security Blanket

Many who will welcome the new year under flimsy pandals around the Bhima Koregaon war memorial have spent every December 31 here, swatting mosquitoes and singing Ambedkarite songs to distract from the cold. But January 1, 2019, is different. It marks a year of deepening faultlines at the site of the 1818 war that saw a Colonial army, helped by a Mahar regiment, defeat the Peshwas. This new year, the day that marks the overthrow of upper-caste rule is time to mull over what remains a divided society.

""It's going to be peaceful tomorrow,"" says Santosh Davne, 35, from Nanded. A vendor of trinkets featuring Dr B R Ambedkar and the Buddha, the disabled Davne has been visiting the Jaystambh, the obelisk to honour soldiers who died on January 1, 1818, on the banks of the Bhima, for 12 years. ""I set up a stall every year, but I have never seen such police presence or such quiet fear among people,"" he says.

Mayawati said there was a need to warn the Congress regarding unfulfilled promises on the New Year's eve as well as in view of the coming Lok Sabha election.

The Congress governments should not back away from the promises the party had made during the assembly election in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, she said in a press statement.

6. Gujarat Changes Roll Call: Jai Hind, Jai Bharat to Replace Present, Teacher

Taking inspiration from a Rajasthan teacher who was honoured in Ahmedabad last Saturday by RSS-affiliated Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the Gujarat government Monday asked all schools to ensure that students respond with ""Jai Bharat"" or ""Jai Hind"" during roll call from January 1.

The Government Resolution (GR) was issued in a circular by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, and Director, Primary Education. ""In order to instil nationalism from a young age, it is directed that students of all schools, government, grant-in-aid as well as private, should say 'Jai Bharat' or 'Jai Hind', instead of 'Yes sir' or 'Present sir' across the state from January 1, 2019. Ensure this is followed across all schools,"" the circular states.

7. 30 Lakh Reapply for Inclusion in Assam NRC

About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday.

During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft.

The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on 25 September. It was to have closed on 15 December, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to 31 December after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on 5 and 9 December, had robbed the people and officials of precious time.

8. Pumps to Remove Water from Meghalaya Mine on Tuesday

Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, found a wooden structure, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday.

Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes - narrow tunnels where miners have to crawl into to extract coal.

R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said.

9. Pujara and Kohli Difference Between Two Sides, Says Australia Coach Langer

Australian coach Justin Langer has lamented a lack of world-class batsmen in his side's line-up and pointed out that Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have been the difference for the visitors in the on-going four-match Test series.

India won the third Test at the MCG by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. The fourth Test begins in Sydney on Thursday, 3 January.

""At this stage, the difference in the series is Pujara and Kohli, if we're frank. Pujara averages 53 and Kohli has averaged 46 and got a duck in the second innings. The lesson we learn from that is he just absorbed all our pressure,"" Langer said on Monday.

Diwali was toxic, Christmas was too and so was New Year's Eve with the air quality 'severe' on the last day of 2018, in sync perhaps with a year in which there was no getting away from the pollution. As Delhiiites prepared to ring in a New Year with the air quality index (AQI) hovering at hazardous levels, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) reported that that 2018 was twice as bad as 2017 in terms of 'severe' air quality days.

In 2018, a total of 18 severe air quality days were recorded in comparison to nine the previous year, CPCB data showed. The year, weary Delhiites said, seemed to pass in a blur of 'severe', 'very poor' and 'poor' air quality days, forcing children and the elderly to stay indoors, morning walkers delaying their daily exercise and schools moving around play times to reduce exposure to the outdoors. Experts said Delhiites breathed over three months of toxic air in 2018. However, the number of 'very poor' days in 2018 were 82, less than the 106 such days in 2017, the CPCB data said.

An AQI between 100 to 200 comes under the 'moderate' category, 201 and 300 is 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', while that between 401 and 500 is 'severe'. There was little escaping the pollution, even in the dying days of 2018 with the last 10 days of the year witnessing intense pollution spells, when the AQI would slip to 'severe' by night and then slightly improve to 'very poor'.

According to officials, the combination of calm wind and colder conditions is elevating pollution levels at night while it gets marginally better during the day with wind speeds picking up slightly and temperatures increasing. The reason for the region's worsening pollution in the summer months can also be attributed to a dust storm in June that resulted in a sudden spike in PM10 (fine particulate matter in the air with a diameter of less than 10 micrometer) level and pushed the overall air quality to 'severe'.

India has witnessed more than 50 storms since February this year. The storm season in 2018 was attributed to western disturbances, low pressure over the Indo-Gangetic plains and intense heating in west and northwest India, an analysis carried out by Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) showed.

On June 9, a severe dust storm followed by thunderstorms with wind speed of 96 km per hour hit Delhi. It was the sixth such storm since April, the most number of storms in a season in a decade. On June 12, Rajasthan witnessed a 'ground-level' dust storm that drastically increased coarser particles in the air. The air quality after June showed improvement with the monsoon season but even then there were just three days of good air quality. But the air quality started deteriorating again from October, worsening to 'very poor'.

The first episode of 'severe' air quality of the winter season was registered on October 31. The days around Diwali were the worst -- 'severe' two days earlier and the worst of the year the day after on November 8 when an AQI of 642 was recorded. The pollution after Diwali was 11 times the permissible limit, due to rampant bursting of toxic firecrackers in violation of a Supreme Court order. In 2017, the AQI a day after Diwali was 367. Unfortunately, Christmas was terrible too with unfavourable conditions like a drop in temperature again pushing the national capital's air quality to 'severe'.

A CSE analysis showed marginal improvement in the air quality in autumn and early winter months (October, November and December) of 2018 compared to the same period last year. ""There is a drop in the number of very poor days from 56 per cent in 2017 to 46 per cent in 2018. But there are hardly any good, satisfactory or even moderately polluted days in sight,"" said Vivek Chattopadhyay, senior programme manager, Clean Air Programme, CSE.

The rising pollution levels had their inevitable health consequences. According to a study released in the global health journal Lancel Planet Health 2018, one of every eight deaths in India is attributable to air pollution. Over one lakh children under five years of age died in India in 2016 due to exposure to toxic air, according to a new WHO study which noted that about 98 per cent of children in the same age group in low- and middle-income countries were exposed to air pollution.

Environmental activists believe zero pollution is the solution, not ""less or more"" pollution. ""It must be targeted to become zero. We are at emergency levels of toxicity in the air. I do not believe we have enough political will yet to tackle air pollution at all sources as urgently and cohesively as it needs to be tackled,"" said Ravina Kohli, environmentalist and a member of #MyRightToBreathe campaign. ""Air pollution is a fixable problem.

Awareness of the problem has increased through active citizen action with media support but we are nowhere near making what we can call progress that will save lives and therefore, I believe... government still in denial of this serious problem,"" she added.

Jyoti Pande Lavakare, co-founder, Care for Air NGO, said more people die due to air pollution in India today than war, man-made or natural disasters. ""We need real, measurable progress and a concerted effort to bring air pollution down to acceptable levels,"" she said. As another New Year dawns, millions of people in the city and its suburbs hoped that it would be a cleaner, healthier, less toxic one."

After introducing the Singur land agitation in history syllabus of schools in 2017, the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education is all set to include a new poem by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to its curriculum.

A poem penned by Banerjee to promote the Safe Drive, Save Life campaign in the state will be taught to students to inculcate awareness about road safety. Another song by Banerjee written for the state's Kanyashree project for the girl child also features in the new plan for students.

As part of its physical education curriculum, teachers have been instructed to teach students the Safe Drive, Save Life theme poem. Launching the campaign in 2016, Banerjee had stated that it was aimed to achieve cohesion among civil society, police, transport, health, roads and other government departments and NGOs to sensitise people about different aspects of safe driving and road safety.

It is indeed a great step. Our CM has written several books and poems. We are proud of her, TMC MP Idris Ali said, adding that his leader was a true all-rounder.

The BJP, however, mocked the initiative, terming it a misuse of public money.

When people are in power they do such things. Earlier, they had omitted a chapter on Netaji and included Singur as per her whims. This is nothing but a dictatorial mindset. Crores of public money is being spent to publish her poems, which no one reads. It is being forced on schools,"" state BJP president Dilip Ghosh said.

The bill seeks to criminalise the practice of triple talaq, or instant divorce, in the Muslim community. It includes a jail term of three years for the husband pronouncing triple talaq and also makes the practice a a non-bailable offence.

Among other bills on the Rajya Sabha's agenda are the Allied and Healthcare Professions Bill, 2018, to be introduced by Health Minister Jagat Prakash Nadda, the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018, and the Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2018.

Taking forward the Modi government's 'Make In India' initiative, Railways inducted semi-high speed Train-sets of European standard as Integral Coach Factory took up manufacturing of Semi High Speed (160 Kmph) Self-Propelled Train-set with indigenous efforts, termed Train-18, with contemporary features as per global standards.

The first trainset has been rolled out by ICF in October 2018 and will shortly be ready for service after testing & trials.ICF shall be making at least two more such rakes this year. Depending on feedback, requirements target for induction in 2019-20 shall be communicated in due course.

Bogibeel bridge: Commissioning of Bogibeel Bridge, is among the mega projects completed by Railways this year.It is longest Rail-cum-Road Bridge of India (4.94 Km long Bridge) across Brahmaputra river near Dibrugarh in Assam, dedicated to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 25.

Double line track with three-lane road and 74 km of total railway track, this Project was sanctioned in 1997-98 at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore and the work was commenced in April, 2002 by Bharat Ratna late Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the then Prime Minister. The completion cost of the project is Rs 5,820 crore (approx).

Safety first: Safety continues to be the foremost priority of Railways and is accorded the greatest consideration. During the current year, Ministry of Railways launched following four safety drives on all Zonal Railways with a view to preventing accidents and strengthening safety in trains.

As a result of relentless efforts put in by Railways, consequential train accidents decreased from 104 to 73 during 2017-18 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year. In the year 2018-19 (from April 1 to November 30) consequential train accidents decreased further from 51 to 44 in comparison to the corresponding period of the previous year.

On April 13 all zonal railways were advised to launch a one month safety drive particularly focusing on strict observance of shunting practices with compliance of rules/instructions contained in G&SR. On October 16, zonal Railways were advised to launch a special safety drive for a period of fifteen days with special emphasis on safety of work sites, stacking and handling of railway material near track and maintenance of points & crossings.

Smart coach with diagnostic system monitor bearing vibrations provides advance information on health of bearing wheel & track. In addition, coach has been provided with wheel slip protection monitoring.

Further improvements are being brought about to provide fire safety through fire and smoke detection unit integrated with passenger announcement and information system for emergency evacuation and video analytics with phased detection and unusual occurrence features to further enhance safety and security.

Railways did a great work by eliminating of level crossings as 3,478 unmanned LC gates have been eliminated during the current year so far. In effect, all unmanned level crossings on broad gauge over Indian Railway have been eliminated except one. This will also be eliminated in the current financial year.

Out of 16, total 15 Zonal Railways are now unmanned level crossing free on broad gauge, accidents on unmanned level crossings have reduced from 20 in 2017-18 to 3 in the current year up to December 2018.

Act East: DEMU services were introduced in Tinsukia Division of NF Railway in 2016-17. New coaching depots have become functional at Silchar in Barak valley region of Assam and at Agartala in Tripura. These measures have provided better connectivity to the isolated region of North East. The following projects have also been sanctioned for the North East region.

Railways saw a vast level of development in North East Region like 970 km Gauge Conversion completed in NE region in last four years. Thus, all MG sections converted to BG and there is no MG operation in entire North East Region. 353.15 km of New Line/Gauge Conversion/Doubling commissioned per year during the period 2014-15 to 2017-18 as against on average of 110 km commissioning per year in NE Region in period from 2009 to 2014.

Fifteen new lines projects of 1,397 km length having a total cost of Rs 47,695 crore are in different stages of planning, sanction, execution which fall partly or fully in the NE states. Six doubling projects of 482 km length having a total cost of Rs 9,305 crore are in different stages of Planning/Sanction/Execution which fall partly orfully in the states of NE region.

Railways has also enhanced the connectivity to North Eastern states. The Seven Sister States of North Eastern India (Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh) have been connected by Rail network. Meghalaya came on the rail map with the flagging off the first ever train from Guwahati to Mendipathar in Meghalaya on November 29, 2014 by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Tripura has been put on broad gauge railway map. On July 31, 2016, the then Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu flagged off the Agartala-New Delhi 'Tripura Sundari Express'. The Agartala-New Delhi Rajdhani Express was launched on October 28, 2017. It trudges the longest route (2,422 km) for any Rajdhani Express in service.

Jiribam, the first railway station in Manipur was connected by broad gauge line. The Prime Minister flagged off the first passenger train service to Jiribam on May 27, 2016. The passenger train service to Bhairabi in Mizoram was also flagged off by him. Lumding - Silchar Broad Gauge section inaugurated after Gauge Conversion on November 20, 2015, giving seamless BG connectivity to Barak Valley of Assam.

Manufacturing: Railways have decided to completely switch over to manufacture of LHB design main line coaches from 2018-19 onwards. The production of LHB coaches in Production Units has continuously increased over the years Production of LHB coaches from 2004-05 to 2013-14 was 2, 327 coaches, whereas 5,548 coaches were produced from 2014-15 to 2017-18. During 2018-19, it is proposed to manufacture 4,016 coaches.

There has been highest ever sanction of track machines as the average sanction of machines per year for complete mechanization has been increased to 117 costing about Rs1,547 crore during 2014-18 compared to 63 costing about Rs 560 crore prior to 2014. Highest ever 538 machines costing Rs 7,268 crore were sanctioned in the current year Budget to give fillip to mechanisation.

Hundred per cent indigensation has already been achieved in manufacturing of around 20-25 per cent of total fleet of the track machines such as Utility Vehicles (UTVs), Rail Bound Maintenance Vehicles (RBMVs), Track Laying Equipment (TLE), Rail Threader & Rail-cum-Road Vehicles over Indian Railways.

Seventy per cent of the existing fleet of machines have been manufactured by a world's leading manufacturer with a local content in the range of 20 per cent to 50 per cent.

Modernisation: This year saw improved sleepers and fittings. In order to strengthen track structure, a wider and heavier sleeper has been developed in 2014 which is fit for 25 t axle load at 100 kmph. After successful field trial over five Zonal Railways wider and heavier sleeper has been adopted and approved for full use from FY 2019-20. This is done in a record time of 3 years from drawing board to insertion in field for trial against normal period of 8-10 years.

A web based system for granting permission of track crossing related to various public utilities like water, sewerage, gas pipeline, OFC cable has been developed and made operational on Indian Railways since April 1, 2015.

This system provides submission of online application and knowing status of the same till permission is granted. This avoids the frequent visits of the user to the Railway Offices for knowing the status of application.

To expedite clearance of track crossing cases, power to accord sanction is delegated to DRM for all the cases.A web based application called Land Management Module integrated with Track Management System (TMS) of Indian Railways has been developed, for maintaining centralized land data that is details of acquisition/area/usages and land plans of Land Bank of Indian Railways in digitized form.

Indian Railways has already completed most of the work related to digitization of land record.Station beautification became an important constituent of development this year as Railways launched an innovative initiative for the station beautification with wall art of paints and graffiti or local arts with participation of local artists, private groups and volunteers. At least 65 stations across Zonal railways have been beautified under this initiative by utilising skills of local artists, mostly using local art form, painting style, local themes or contemporary arts.

This initiative provided forum for expression of the emerging talents in the area and visibility of local art forms to the travellers. Balharshah & Chandrapur Railway stations (Central Railway) Madhubani Railway station (East Central Railway) & Madurai Railway station (Southern Railway) Gandhidham Railway station (Western Railway), Kota Railway station (West Central Railway) & Secunderabad Railway station (South Central Railway) have been beautified.

Indian Railways has also commenced work on soft upgradation of 68 stations . This is targeted to be completed by March 31, 2019. This initiative is to give substantial improvement to various passenger amenities like traffic circulation, inter platform transfer, waiting halls, facade improvement, lighting and accessible stations to Divyangjan.

Also Railways introduced many modern trains, coaches in 2018 like Humsafar Trains which have additional amenities in the coaches have recently been introduced for providing comfortable Air-Conditioned III Tier travel. So far 29 Humsafar rakes (9 rakes in 2016-17, 10 rakes in 2017-18, 10 rakes in 2018-19 up to 30.11.18) have been turned out by the Production Units.

Major features of GPS based Passenger information system, passenger announcement system, dust bins in each bay, coffee vending m/c, improved aesthetics pleasing colour scheme, passenger announcement system, closed-circuit television (CCTV) based surveillance system, integrated braille displays have been introduced in the trains.

Passengers could have different experiences through fully geared up Antodaya trains, Deen Dayalu Coaches, Tejas trains. Vistadome coaches with enhanced viewing area including on roof to enable tourists to enjoy panoramic view while travelling. The feature has been well received. Total of four such coaches are in service on scenic sections.

Project Swarn was started to upgrade the condition of Rajdhani and Shatabdi Express Trains, with the objective of significantly improving the passenger experience across 9 dimensions which include coach interiors, toilets, onboard cleanliness, staff behavior, catering, linen, punctuality, security, on-board entertainment. Real time feedback is also a part of Project Swarn. Under this scheme total 29 trains as targeted have been covered at Rs 50 lakh per rake.

Enhancing passenger convenience with an elevated level of comfort and a highly satisfying experience, introduction of ticket booking through mobile phone - UTSONMOBILE App for unreserved ticket booking and IRCTC RAIL CONNECT App for reserved ticket booking, establishment of Yatri Ticket Suvidha Kendras on public private partnership basis for issuing of tickets, launch of the Next Generation E-ticketing System (NGeT) for improving accessibility and enhancing the overall experience of e-ticketing, introduction of Defence Travel System enabling online booking of tickets for defence personnel.

It is now provided at 697 stations, independent third party Survey of passenger perception on Cleanliness standards of 407 major railway stations carried out first time in 2016 and repeated in 2017 and 201, On Board House Keeping Service (OBHS) is being provided since 2008-09.

Starting from 2008-09, OBHS was provided in 416 pairs of trains up to March, 2014. 448 pairs of trains added in 3 years from 2014-15 to 2016-17. Another 139 added in 2017-18 and 65 more in 2018-19. A total of 1068 trains are presently having facility of this service.

Moreover, all Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other important long distance Mail/Express trains are provided with OBHS for cleaning of coach toilets, doorways, aisles and passenger compartments during the run of the trains. Service is supported by sms based on demand ""Clean-my-Coach"" service in 1059 trains, augmented to ""Coach-Mitra"", since 2017-18 to cover over 1020 trains presently. Railways are setting up mechanized laundries for improving quality of washing of linen provided to AC coach passengers.

Starting from 2009-10, 25 mechanised laundries were set up till March, 2014. 32 more mechanised laundries were set up from 2014-15 to 2018-19.

As a part of ""Swachh Bharat Mission"", Railways is proliferating bio-toilets on all its coaching stock so that no human waste is discharged from coaches on to the track. During 2017-18, against the target of 40,000; 57,429 bio-toilets have been provided in 15,017 coaches, as compared to 10,159; 15,442 and 34,134 bio-toilets in 3374, 3,961 and 8,788 coaches in last three years.

Go Green: With a view to transforming Indian Railways into ""Green Railways"" and to capture the economic benefits of electric traction in an accelerated manner, Indian Railways has planned to electrify balance BG routes by 2021-22.

Accordingly, the work for electrification of balance un-electrified BG routes of IR covering 13,675 route kilometers has been approved by CCEA at a cost of Rs 12,134.50 crore. To achieve ambitious target for electrification of balance route, following strategic policy decisions have been taken.

Base off executing agencies have been broadened and projects covering 1,735 RKM have already been entrusted to Govt PSUs i.e. IRCON, RITES and PGCIL. Timelines and approving authorities for various drawings/schematic/plan approval for RE projects have been re-defined. It has been decided that ""Henceforth, where, electrification and doubling works are sanctioned; both works shall be executed by the same agency.""

In its green initiatives for saving the environment, assessment and rating of IRs Production Units and major Workshops as Green Industrial Units started with 'GreenCo' certification of two workshops and one production unit in 2016-17. Thirtyone more Workshops, 4 more Production Units, 2 Diesel Sheds, one Stores depot and 2 STCs have been 'GreenCo' certified since.

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

Ahead of the elections, politicians were actively engaged in swapping party allegiance. The most-telling of such political crossover was Neiphiu Rio's leaving of the NPF, only to return to power AS the chief minister once again with his newly formed NDPP.

On the political front, this year also saw the resurrection of BJP in the state with the party winning 12 seats to cement its influential position in the ruling collation of People's Democratic Alliance. An ugly exchange of verbal toxicity between the BJP and its one-time ally NPF provided another source of headlining news items to the local newspapers prior to the elections.

The most high-profile visitation came in the form of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's electioneering at Tuensang town on Feb. 22 where he announced a string of packages for Nagaland worth nearly INR 13,000 cr. Also, he assured a 'respectful solution' to the Naga political issue 'in the next few months' -- which, sadly, never arrived.

'Naga Day' celebrates peoplehood

Calls for 'healing of wounds' across the Naga spectrum, and reaffirmations that Nagas are one regardless of where they were, resonated across Khouchiezie ground in Kohima on Jan. 10 as the first 'Naga Day' was observed in the capital town.

The event commemorated the day in 1929 when the Naga Club submitted the historic Naga Hills memorandum to the then British Statutory Commission headed by Sir John Allsebrook Simon. The representation sought safeguard of the rights of the Naga people. The memorandum is considered to be the first written record that establishes the Naga people a singular socio-political entity. The event was organised by the Forum for Naga Reconciliation.

District demand boomerangs

Close on the heels of the state government announcing the upgrade of Noklak sub-division to a full-fledged district and the Rengmas' demand for Tseminyu sub-division to be elevated to a district headquarter, people of Aboi under Mon district started pressing the government for upgrade of Aboi to that of a district headquarters on Jan. 11.

Another demand for district returned with Pughoboto rallying for district status on Jan. 30 while justifying their demand by way of pointing out that Pughoboto was one of the oldest sub-divisions in the state after it was accorded the status in 1986.

Among the 19, 618 teachers employed in government-run schools, only 7418 are professionally qualified while the 12,200 are professionally 'unqualified'.

Health is wealth

July saw safety checks initiated by the Dimapur Municipal Council (DMC) on formalin-laced fish, and Nagaland Food Safety Cell training guns on bakeries and carbide-laced fruits. The DMC team inspected the fish markets in Dimapur and collected samples for testing. Consequently, fish laced with formalin were banned in Nagaland.

The state Food Safety authority also destroyed over 5000 kg of adulterated 'fresh' fruits, which were seized after testing positive for a carcinogenic artificial ripening chemical agent. The disposed fruits included mango, pomegranate, watermelon and tomato. Mangoes comprised the bulk of the impounded items weighing in at around 5000 kg.

Monsoon havoc and public transport

The monsoon havoc began on the latter part of July that continued for whole of August during which Nagaland suffered loss of lives, properties, and displacement of families. Kohima and Kiphire suffered the most even as road leading to Kiphire was cut-off from the rest of Nagaland. The central government had to intervene even as the Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, and governor PB Acharya appealed to the centre for assistance.

The West Bengal government plans to review rules relating to the obtaining of licence and sale of two-wheelers. The policy will come up for consideration in January.

The 'stringent' rules -- which came into effect since June -- have seen scooter and motor-cycle sales tank. Subsequent relaxations were also made by the State government to help push sales.

""We will review the two-wheeler sale policy in January. The date of the meeting is yet to be decided,"" BP Gopalika, Principal Secretary in-charge of the West Bengal Transport department, told BusinessLine.

The policy change, brought in June, issued an advisory barring sale and registration of two-wheelers in the name of people without driving licences. Two-wheeler buyers had to get their identity verified as well.

The State government officials reasoned that the move was aimed at bringing down accidents. But, the question of how a person was to obtain a licence without their own bike remained unanswered. West Bengal does not have any two-wheelers only driving schools.

The immediate effect of this advisory was a drop in sales, which unofficial estimates suggest slid by 60-70 per cent initially, especially during the festive season. Approximately, one lakh two-wheelers were previously being sold in West Bengal on a monthly basis.

In September, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) moved a petition in the Calcutta High Court challenging the advisory. Justice Harish Tandon partially stayed the government notification that prohibited sale (of two-wheelers) without a driving licence.

Later, in October, norms were relaxed. One could buy a two-wheeler without a driving licence, but had to apply for a learner's licence from the store and give an undertaking that no one without a licence will ride the vehicle. Dealers, on the other hand, were ""advised"" to sell bikes after verifying the buyer's 'profile', age, and other documents. They were also asked to upload self-attested copies of these documents, along with online application for registration, on the government database. Earlier, an RTO would profile the buyer.

Norms were further relaxed in November, when the State government said: ""Payment of fees for a learner's licence shall not be a pre-condition for allowing registration,"" and that dealers need not upload documents in ""e-Vahan"".

Although these relaxations have led to ""some improvement"" in sales, the numbers are yet to reach the level seen in previous years.

""People have delayed purchases and are awaiting for more clarity on the rules. Compared to the August-September period when sales dropped drastically, numbers are now picking up,"" a two-wheeler dealer said on conditions of anonymity.

The State government, according to Gopalika, was yet to collect data on sales numbers of two-wheelers post relaxation of rules in November.

Deeply disturbed by the condition of a private shelter home in New Delhi's Dwarka region, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) prompted Delhi Police to register an FIR against the abusive staff.

An expert committee of the DCW on Thursday (December 27) found that girls living in the shelter home were being abused and tortured by the domestic staff. The committee included Promila Gupta, Firdaus Khan, Vandana Singh and external member Ritu Mehra.

The girls, aged between 6-15 years, informed members of the expert committee that the elderly lot (13-15 years) were forced to do household chores in the shelter home apart from taking care of the younger girls.

From washing utensils to cleaning toilets, the teenagers were forced to do all the daily chores. Food offered to these children were also not of proper quality.

Horrific punishments

The expert committee was left shocked after learning about the punishments meted out to young children and teenage girls in the home.

Teenagers complained that any sort of defiant behaviour from young children would be met with serious and grave punishment. They claimed that the home staff forced them to eat chilli powder in order to discipline them.

Some of the girls also testified that chilli powder was shoved publicly in their vagina and butts by female shelter home staff members as a form of punishments.

The girls were also beaten with rulers for not keeping rooms clean and ignoring staff members. They were not even permitted to go home during summer and winter vacations.

FIR registered

After receiving testimonies from the girls, the expert committee shared details of the case with DCW Chief Swati Maliwal, who immediately reached the shelter home shortly.

She immediately called the Deputy Commissioner for Police, Dwarka who sent a team of senior officers to the shelter home and recorded statements of the children.

An FIR has been registered by Delhi Police against the staff of the Home.

Maliwal has also appraised the Women and Child Development (WCD) ministry about the activities at the private-run shelter home.

Livid at the conditions in the shelter home, WCD minister Maneka Gandhi immediately instructed Chairperson of Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and senior officers of WCD to reach the shelter home.

However, the children appealed to the Commission to not relocate them from the home as they go to schools nearby.

Therefore, DCW has appealed to the CWC to not relocate the children to another home but immediately ensure complete overhauling and removal of the staff of the home. The Government is planning to set up an inquiry in the matter.

The DCW chief along with members of the expert committee stayed in the shelter home till early morning.

A team of DCW counsellors as well as police (in plain clothes) have been deputed in the home to ensure the safety of children. The DCW shall continue to monitor the condition of the shelter home in future.

New Delhi: Senior members of the union cabinet had expressed strong reservations against the new Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification, but it was approved nonetheless Thursday, sources privy to cabinet deliberations told ThePrint.

The ministers, including Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi were of the view that the new notification -- allowing construction in the ecologically-sensitive coastal areas -- will be ""catastrophic"", one of the sources said.

The notification was piloted by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, headed by Dr Harsh Vardhan.

It supersedes the 2011 notification, and allows construction of buildings for residential purposes, schools, hospitals, institutions, offices, public places etc. on the landward side of the existing road, or on the landward side of existing authorised fixed structures. However, no permission for construction of buildings shall be given on landward side of any new roads which are constructed on the seaward side of an existing road, it states.

The new notification allows floor space index (ratio between the built-up area to the area of the land on which the building stands) for construction projects as per current norms in CRZ areas. In the 2011 notification, the floor space index was frozen as per the 1991 Development Control Regulation levels.

A second source in the government said Finance Minister Jaitley was of the view that no new construction should be allowed near the coast. At best, reconstruction could be allowed in structures that already exist.

""Jaitley said it is not a good legislation,"" the source said.

Defence Minister Sitharaman, meanwhile, gave examples of how land in some coastal villages was getting eroded by the sea.

WCD Minister Gandhi too opposed the notification, saying that despite the checks and balances proposed, the new legislation will open up fragile and ecologically-sensitive coastlines for rampant real estate development.

The environment minister tried to reassure his cabinet colleagues that the notification was drafted after consulting all stakeholders.

Vardhan said the draft notification was put up on the ministry's website, inviting comments and suggestions from the public. ""The ministry received approximately 3,000 suggestions supporting the new notification,"" a source quoted Vardhan as saying.

Among the ministers who supported the new CRZ notification were Railway Minister Piyush Goyal, Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari and Textiles Minister Smriti Irani.

""Irani said that slum colonies should be made for the poor on the coastline,"" a source added."

From the CBSE Class 12 Economics exam paper leak to alleged leak of Staff Selection Commission's (SSC) CGL 2017 exam. The probe is on in these cases.

The government's decision to scrap homework for Class 1, 2 students, and setting limits to the weight of school bags to granting the Institute of Eminence status to best institutes of India was praised by many, likewise many academicians criticised its role to dissolve University Grants Commission (UGC). As the year draws to a close, we look back at some of the crucial events and decisions happened in the education sector.

Year-ender 2018: Top education news of this year Institute of Eminence status

The Union Human Resource Development Ministry in July granted the Institution of Eminence (IoE) status to the IIT Delhi, IIT Bombay and IISc Bangalore. From the private sector, the Manipal Academy of Higher Education, BITS Pilani, and Jio Institute were granted the tag. The UGC had received 103 applications including JNU and Delhi University for IoE status. The selection of Reliance Foundation's non-existent Jio Institute triggered a political debate with the Opposition accusing the NDA of favouritism. As per the RTI filed by The Indian Express, the government internally disagreed about the Jio institute,

CBSE paper leak

The paper leak of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE Class 10, 12) examinations is one of the biggest education scams of this year, as the board has to cancel the papers of both Class 12 examinations following the leak. The police had made significant arrest in this case, 12 people were arrested from Bihar in connection CBSE Class 10 Mathematics paper leak, and three from Delhi for CBSE Class 12 Economics paper leak.

Advertising

To prevent the paper leak, from this year the board is planning to use encrypted question papers. Under the encrypted system, each examination centre will be provided with login details and the question paper will be printed in the school and then photocopied and distributed.

No homework for classes 1, 2 students, HRD ministry limits school bag weight

The students of classes 1 and 2 do not have to do homework, as per the directives issued by the Human Resources Development (HRD) Ministry to states and union territories. The directives also mentioned the prescribed weight limit of school bags for each class.

According to the official order, the HRD ministry has ""instructed all the states and Union Territories to formulate guidelines to regulate the teaching of subjects and weight of school bags in accordance with the Government of India instructions"".

As per these instructions, which the schools have been asked to comply with, institutions cannot assign homework to students of classes I and II. ""Schools should not prescribe any other subjects except language and mathematics for classes I and II and language, EVS and mathematics for classes III to V students as prescribed by the NCERT,"" the order said.

JEE Main to be conducted twice a year

The HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar in July announced that JEE (Mains) will be conducted twice a year. While the JEE (Mains) will be held in January and April, NEET will be conducted in May, the minister said.

The latest development has come as a breather for many students grappling with the inadequate time to prepare for these exams, which were previously conducted once a year. Earlier, students used to appear for these exams just after their Class 12 Board, forcing them to focus on their board and entrance exams simultaneously.

CBSE relaxes passing criteria for Class 10 students

In a relief to Class 10 students, the Central Board of Secondary Education has extended the passing criteria. ""To give relaxation to students, the board has decided to ease the passing criteria for Class 10 students from 2019,"" said CBSE chairman Anita Karwal. From next year, the students need to get a minimum of 33 per cent marks in theory and practical combined to declare pass in the subject.

""It has now been decided to extend the same passing criteria henceforth for the students of secondary classes i.e. candidates appearing for Class 10 examination 2019 onwards will have to secure 33 per cent (both taken together) in the subjects to be eligible to pass the subject,"" mentioned the official release. Earlier, CBSE had announced that students do not have to pass separately in theory as well as practical exams.

Senior executives can now be IIM director

Future directors of the prestigious Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) may no longer need to have anything to do with academia -- or even possess a PhD. According to rules notified under the IIM Act this week, executives, who have been in senior management roles for at least 15 years, will now be eligible to be appointed as directors.

The premier business schools, in the past, have been headed by corporate executives, but such examples are few and far between. Ravi J Matthai, the first full-time director of IIM-Ahmedabad in 1965, and Subir Chowdhury, who headed IIM-Calcutta in the 1990s, are two such examples.

Scrapping of UGC

The Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry had in July announced its decision to replace the University Grants Commission (UGC) with the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI) by repealing the UGC Act, 1951.

According to a draft, which has been placed in the public domain by the ministry to seek feedback from the stakeholders, the new commission will solely focus on the academic matters and monetary grants would be under the purview of the ministry. The decision has not gone down well with a section of academicians, who have questioned the move saying politicians should not be involved in academic matters.

UGC scraps 100% weight for the interview in PhD, MPhil, brings in test

Rolling back the controversial selection rule for research students, the University Grants Commission (UGC) scrapped oral interviews, or viva-voce, as the sole criterion for admission to Ph D and M.Phil programmes.

The higher education regulator has amended the UGC (Minimum Standards and Procedure for Award of M.Phil/ Ph.D Degree) Regulations 2016 to give 70 per cent weightage to performance in the written entrance test and 30 per cent to the oral interview for the final selection of a candidate, The Indian Express has learned.

The commission has also permitted relaxation of five percentage points in the minimum marks to be scored in the written test by SC, ST and OBC candidates. So, while a general candidate will have to secure at least 50 per cent in the entrance examination to qualify for the interview or viva voice, a candidate from the reserved category will have to score 45 per cent.

Visva Bharati VC row: Tussle between govt and president on the appointment of VC

The government asked President Ram Nath Kovind to overturn his decision on the appointment of Visva Bharati University Vice-Chancellor (V-C) only after he ignored HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar's recommendation for the post and chose Swapan Kumar Dutta instead, according to official records accessed by The Indian Express under the Right to Information (RTI) Act.

As reported by The Indian Express on February 23, Kovind, in an unprecedented move, withdrew his assent to Dutta's selection as the head of Visva Bharati in Santiniketan, at the behest of the HRD Ministry. He also scrapped the panel of three finalists forwarded by the government last year.

National Medical Commission Bill

Government think-tank NITI Aayog has pitched for enactment of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, observing that regulatory bodies the Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India have ""failed"" to ensure adequate availability and quality of health professionals.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses, as reported by PTI.

On Thursday, he tweeted taking exception to the plan and said he would have a discussion on the matter with Mr. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Siddaramaiah said there was a need for the State government to have clarity on Kannada language learning and Kannada medium.

The government currently seems to be unclear on what its stance is on introducing English medium in 1,000 schools. While the proposal was mooted by Mr. Kumaraswamy during the 2018-2019 budget session, he later retracted his statement and said English would only be taught as a language.

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Aashish Aryan reports.

On the bright sunny morning of January 12, four senior Supreme Court judges held an unprecedented press conference and expressed their concerns about the professional conduct of the then Chief Justice of India, Justice Dipak Misra, over the assignment of cases.

In the virtual revolt against the CJI, Justices J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur, and Kurien Joseph questioned the system and said that a skewed allocation of cases was impacting justice delivery adversely.

The four judges had then repeatedly said that despite their best efforts to reach out to Justice Misra, there had been no response from him, which left them with no option but to come face to face with the nation (via the press).

Of the four, Justice Chelameswar and Justice Joseph have already retired since, Justice Lokur will relinquish his post by the month end.

Justice Gogoi is the incumbent CJI.

The press conference by the four judges set the wheels of change in motion, according to Justice Joseph.

Addressing reporters after his retirement, Justice Joseph said he had no regrets about the press conference.

He also expected Justice Gogoi to steer the ship more effectively.

Some legislators thought the judicial rebels had done the right thing, raising issues that were critical to functioning of this vital institution of democracy.

How far the political dispensation will respect the spirit of that revolt is another question.

#2 The landmark Aadhaar verdict Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

But the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

Udit Misra reports.

After a nine-judge Bench of the Supreme Court unanimously ruled in 2017 that the Right to Privacy was indeed a Fundamental Right under the Indian Constitution, all eyes were on the five-judge Bench of the apex court adjudicating on not only the legal validity of Aadhaar but also its usage.

Indeed, it was the Aadhaar case that required clarity on the Right to Privacy in the first place.

The apex court delivered an interim order in March and a full one in September.

While the court upheld the validity of the Aadhaar Act, albeit by a four-to-one majority, it severely restricted the parameters for its use.

Thus, starkly in contrast to the coercive annoyance that Aadhaar had become over the years -- with it becoming a pre-condition for everything from mobile services to banking to health care to monthly food rations -- its use has now become voluntary.

But the court ruled that Aadhaar will continue to be mandatory for State-sponsored welfare schemes and will need to be linked to the permanent account numbers for income tax purposes.

#3 IIMs and the autonomy mirage IMAGE: The Indian Institute of Management-Ahmedabad. Photograph: Kind courtesy IIM-A

2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

Vinay Umarji reports.

Not since Infosys co-founder and former Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad board chairman N R Narayana Murthy took on then Union minister of human resource development Murli Manohar Joshi over the latter's decision to slash fees have IIMs seen such a prolonged fight for autonomy.

In that sense, 2018 was a landmark year for the premier B-schools even as it ushered in a new era with the promulgation of the IIM Act.

At first, IIMs welcomed the freedom to appoint chairpersons and directors in place of the earlier cumbersome process that required government approval.

However, the year saw IIMs raising other issues that not only threatened their autonomy but also increased administrative woes for them.

For instance, under the Act, IIMs can offer PhD as against the previous fellow doctoral programmes.

However, the government narrowed eligibility criteria by increasing the cut-off to 80 per cent from the 60 per cent for four-year undergraduate applicants.

IIMs say this would reduce the available pool of candidates, apart from reducing course work in doctoral programmes from two years to six months.

Further, the one-year post graduate programmes for executives with prior work experience of at least 5 to 7 years are set to be converted into two-year MBAs under the Act.

This too, IIMs believe, would lower standards and defeat the purpose of conducting one-year MBAs for working professionals.

The year ended with directors of all IIMs and the ministry discussing these issues via video conference in the second week of December 2018.

The ball now rests in the ministry's court.

#4 Volatile year for Indian currency Photograph: Francis Mascarenhas/Reuters

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

Anup Roy reports.

2018 was a volatile one for the rupee as oil prices started rising and trade war concerns between US and China kept emerging market currencies on tenterhooks.

The partially convertible currency started the year at 63.7 a dollar, but trade war tensions, leading to currency war concerns, started pulling it down rapidly in the first half of the year.

The central bank tried to defend the currency till its previous record low of 68.85 a dollar.

However, once the currency crossed 70, the central bank maintained a hands-off approach to protect its reserves.

The movement accelerated in August when oil prices also started climbing up to cross $70 a barrel on concerns about US sanctions.

It was pretty evident after that that the central bank won't protect a level.

Two back-to-back rate hikes by the RBI by August, seen as a measure to protect the currency, were unable to stabilise the rupee, and by September, it had closed at its life-time low of 74.4 a dollar as oil crossed $85 a barrel.

The rupee has now strengthened back to below 72 a dollar, as oil eased to less than $60 a barrel.

But observers say the local currency's new level would continue to be 70 a dollar-plus.

#5 India's exports grow in 2018 Photograph: Kim Hong-Ji/Reuters

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

Subhayan Chakraborty reports.

Despite a global trade war, India managed to grow its exports in 2018 but high crude prices and rising domestic demand continued to inflate the trade deficit at a faster rate.

The year started with monthly trade deficit soaring to a 56-month high.

By October, it had risen to more than $153 billion.

Despite reports of crippling capital inadequacy in the wake of the new Goods and Services Tax regime, double-digit export growth continued for half of the year.

On the other hand, imports also shot up as volatile crude prices made a comeback to haunt policymakers after a year of relative ease.

India's current account deficit is expected to triple to $19 billion to $21 billion in Q2 of FY19, or about 3 per cent of the GDP, from the modest $7 billion in Q2 last fiscal year, economists predict.

As a result, the government placed import restrictions and raised inbound duties on six separate occasions for hundreds of products including textile inputs, steel, mobile phones and solar panels, among others.

The move was strongly criticised for raising protectionist barriers at a time when economic growth was tepid.

But India managed to navigate through a field of tariff landmines as a trade war between the United States and China heated up throughout the year.

New Delhi countered threats by the Donald J Trump administration to cut market access for Indian goods by entering protracted negotiations with the US, that continue at the time of writing.

#6 GST and the problems aplenty Illustration: Dominic Xavier/Rediff.com

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

Ishan Bakshi reports.

Even a year-and-a-half after its launch, the goods and service tax regime continues to pose grave problems for the central government's fiscal maths.

While monthly collections have crossed the Rs 1 trillion mark twice in the current year, they remain well below the desired monthly run rate.

This is despite the number of returns filed rising to 6.96 million in October, up from 6.75 million in September.

On its part, the government had hoped that compliance under the new indirect tax regime would improve with the introduction of the e-way bill.

However, data on Integrated GST domestic collections does not suggest a sustained increase in tax collections.

For the government to meet the budgeted indirect tax target, collections would have to rise to Rs 1.33 trillion per month for the rest of the current financial year, says a report by Kotak Institutional Equities.

Part of the shortfall could be plugged by distributing the unallocated portion of the GST compensation cess between the central and state governments.

Or, the Centre could hold onto IGST collections.

Despite this, the Centre is staring at a huge gap in indirect tax collections, which the report pegs at Rs 800 billion to Rs 900 billion.

#7 India's targets on climate change, Katowice and Paris Agreement IMAGE: Prime Minister Narendra Damodardas Modi with French President Emmanuel Macron. Photograph: @MEAIndia/Twitter

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

Nitin Sethi reports.

India finalised a report noting that it was well on the way to meeting two of its three targets under the first phase of the Paris Agreement.

Soon after, the Katowice climate change negotiations ended with a rulebook to the Paris Agreement.

It took collective pressure from all developing countries, including India, to ensure the rulebook adheres to the letter of the agreement even if it did not stay entirely loyal to its spirit.

For instance, the rules eroded the difference between developing and developed countries to a layer deeper than the agreement had rendered.

With the Paris Agreement itself pared down to let countries largely self-determine how much heft they should put behind the collective fight against climate change, the rules were not expected to deliver more.

But Katowice did deliver a set of rules that will monitor countries deeply for their delivery against the nationally-determined actions, particularly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Countries could not, however, agree to the rules for the operation of the global market for trading in greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris Agreement.

Developed countries wanted developing countries not to take credit for the emissions they trade in.

Developing countries wanted the rich nations not to get to harvest the low-hanging cheaper emission reduction targets only to their account, leaving the poorer nations with heavy bills for technology in emission reductions.

The rules for the market mechanism were deferred to 2019, or perhaps 2020, just before the Paris Agreement gets implemented, starting 2021.

Next year will also witness a summit organised by the UN Secretary General, who has put his weight behind pushing countries to enhance their targets even before the agreement kicks off.

#8 Did Modi govt achieve the target in job creation? Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

Somesh Jha reports.

Until last year, official and private estimates painted a grim picture of job creation -- a key election promise of Narendra Damodardas Modi on the campaign trail in 2014.

In January 2018, the government sought to change the narrative.

A study commissioned by its own think-tank showed that seven million jobs were created in 2017-18 -- closer to the government's promise of providing 10 million jobs.

The study by two independent researchers analysed provident fund data held by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation to map job creation in the private formal sector.

The study predictably drew much flak from various economists for lack of transparency in computing the numbers.

Nevertheless, the government decided to halt all the job surveys by the Labour Bureau and began rolling out the EPFO payroll data on a monthly basis instead.

This backfired.

The payroll numbers provided by the EPFO are dynamic in nature so the figures of job creation kept being revised downwards -- bringing to light another reason the January study was considered unreliable.

The controversy over job creation data is becoming as serious an issue as job creation itself.

But as we move on to 2019, the situation could improve with several official data-sets lined up from the NSSO and the Labour Bureau.

#9 NPAs of Indian banks crosses past Rs 10 trillion Photograph: Reuters

This surprised many observers, if not the bankers, as the true extent of bad debt was not evident before the Reserve Bank of India arm-twisted lenders to disclose whatever was hidden under the carpet.

Anup Roy reports.

In the March 2018 quarter, the gross non-performing assets of Indian banks surged past Rs 10 trillion.

This surprised many observers, if not the bankers, as the true extent of bad debt was not evident before the Reserve Bank of India arm-twisted lenders to disclose whatever was hidden under the carpet.

There are many economic reasons for this NPA pile-up, but the numbers ballooned after the central bank's February 12 circular.

The circular said if a loan is not serviced for 90 days, it is in default and recovery proceedings can be started against it.

Not surprisingly, the gross NPA of all listed banks jumped to Rs 10.25 trillion in the March quarter, from Rs 8.86 trillion in the December 2017 quarter.

The March level was roughly 11.5% of the total loan book.

Adding restructured, and loans suspected to be falling into NPA, the share could be 13% to 14% of the loan book.

RBI's financial stability report says the gross NPA ratios of the banking system could reach 12.2% of the loan book by March 2019.

The good news is that the gross NPAs showed a downward trend in June and then in the September quarter.

This is largely because of the strict Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, or the fear of it.

Bankers now believe the recognition part of NPA is over, and the recovery needs to begin.

#10 A watershed year for corporate India Photograph: Joshua Lott/Reuters

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

Ishita Ayan Dutt reports.

2018 was a watershed year for corporate India with some of its tycoons coming close to losing grip on their companies, courtesy the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.

Most of the big-ticket companies that were being forced to undergo a change in management as part of the law were part of the RBI-mandated list for debt resolution under IBC.

The RBI's first list comprised 12 large accounts with an outstanding claim of Rs 3.45 trillion.

The highest profile from that prized list is Ruia-owned Essar Steel.

Subsequently, the central bank came out with a second list of 27 NPAs that included the likes of Videocon.

The IBC was rolled out about two years ago with the objective of facilitating debt resolution.

Till September, in terms of recovery, financial creditors have realised Rs 584 billion against admitted claims of Rs 1.3 trillion.

Compared to a pre-IBC regime recovery rate of 26 per cent, the Code hasn't fared badly.

However, less than five per cent of the cases have been resolved so far (52 out of 1,198).

The resolution, which was to have been achieved within a maximum time limit of 270 days, has tripped on time-lines.

Of the 816 corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) underway, more than 29 per cent of the cases have breached the extended 270-day deadline within which resolutions were to be completed, and 19 per cent have crossed 180 days.

Yet bankers say these are but early problems of a revolutionary law that has changed the creditor-debtor relationship in significant ways.

Govt also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Kanika Datta reports.

After months of speculation RBI Governor Urjit R Patel submitted his resignation on December 10, the first incumbent to do so since economic liberalisation.

Tensions had been building for some time, especially from August, with the government appointing two loyalists to the RBI board -- maverick accountant and Swadeshi Jagran Manch co-convenor S Gurumurthy and cooperative banker and former Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad treasurer Satish Marathe.

Their induction was seen as disturbing the intricate relationship between the central bank and government.

It coincided with the RBI coming under pressure to part with a larger share of its capital reserves to shore up government finances and to ease lending restrictions on public sector banks under the Prompt Corrective Action regime, especially to the ailing small and medium enterprises sector.

The government also pushed for RBI decision-making to be a more consultative process, meaning board members should have more say.

Theb RBI interpreted this as a direct undermining of its central board.

With tensions mounting between Mint Road and Raisina Hill, Deputy Governor Viral Acharya delivered a speech outlining the case for the central bank's autonomy in the interests of long-term financial stability.

It was seen as a pointed message to the government.

There the issue rested in a miasma of rumour that the government would invoke the never-used Section 7 of the RBI Act -- which involves a direct order from the government to the RBI to carry out its wishes.

A day before the results of five state elections were to be declared and two days before a much-anticipated board meeting, Dr Patel officially put in his papers.

Two days later, former economic affairs secretary Shaktikanta Das, who had been the government's chief spokesman during demonetisation, was appointed as his successor.

The board meeting appeared to have gone off without incident, but this is only the beginning of a new story.

As reported by The Financial Express Online earlier, India had offered Colombia help in reconstruction following the end of 52 years of civil war, as part of a diplomatic drive in South America.

To a question if any new opportunities have emerged for the Indian Oil companies, the source pointed out that ""The end of FARC conflict should open up exploration in new areas and basins that previously had a permanent FARC presence (for example, in parts of Caquetá and Putumayo).""

""Oil companies operating in Colombia plan to invest almost $5 billion next year, up 14 percent from this year. Oil companies invested $4.35 billion in 2018, most of which went into production and some $800 million into exploration,"" the source said.

The industry in Colombia feels that exploration needs to be increased since investment remains at historically low levels with only 1,100 square kilometres of seismic tests undertaken.

Colombia has faced challenges to its oil industry that are unique in light of decades of internal armed conflict. Since the mid-1980s, guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN), and subsequently the FARC, have relentlessly attacked oil installations and personnel through kidnappings, extortion, and sabotage of oil pipelines.

One of the key objectives of peace, as articulated by the government of that country is to empower communities that have been abandoned by the state and subject to the influence of illegal armed groups.

According to the source, ""Many communities in oil producing regions are already quite active in expressing their grievances. This situation is unlikely to change; in fact, protests and work stoppages could actually increase as fear recedes."" The local government has not awarded new areas for exploration in the last four years. The South American nation's proven oil reserves were 1.78 billion barrels at the end of 2017, equivalent to 5.7 years of consumption.

Colombia has cancelled two auctions of rights to explore for oil in dozens of areas and plans to re-launch bidding early next year. Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the leader of FARC, Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri, alias 'Timochenko', in 2016 had inked an accord setting out the timetable for FARC to lay down arms and become a political organisation.

The FARC is now a political party and several members have taken seats in parliament as part of the peace terms. The FARC's fighters have demobilised and handed in their weapons, the group has turned itself into a political party and taken up seats in parliament. However, hundreds of FARC guerrillas refused to sign up the deal and are still at large. They have also been joined by other dissidents, disillusioned with the pace of implementation. Another challenge the government in that country faces is that drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by FARC guerrillas.

President Iván Duque Márquez of Colombia, reiterating that he remains committed to Colombia's peace process, had in his inaugural address on Aug 7, extended the olive branch to peace and promised to look for opportunities for ex-guerrillas and the provision of resources for the entire country and especially for areas that have been hit by violence."

Gaps in infrastructure and lack of awareness are among the primary reasons why the Directorate of Education (DoE) has failed to draw applicants to seats reserved for differently abled children in the city's private schools.

For the first time this year, a three per cent quota for children with special needs was introduced within the 25 per cent EWS/DG category. Despite inviting applications thrice for about 1,300 seats in the category, 1,268 seats are still lying vacant with no applicants. The fourth draw of lots for these seats, to allot schools to applicants, will be conducted on Wednesday.

The Indian Express looked at reports of inspections carried out by the DoE across popular private schools in the city in 2015, to find that most lack the adequate number of special educators, disabled-friendly washrooms and even signage.

The DoE had inspected schools which were identified as having infrastructure to cater to differently abled children.

Of the 162 schools that were inspected to check for facilities for visually impaired students, 156 did not have Braille books, 132 did not have large print books and 143 did not have embossed maps and globes. Only five had Braille signage and 158 lacked tactile pathways. Special educators were missing in 114 schools and 110 did not have disabled-friendly washrooms.

Advertising ExplainedNot enough special educators in MCD, govt schools

Schools in Delhi -- government and private -- are unequipped to cater to students with special needs. In South and North Municipal Corporation schools, there are only 63 special educators against 1,084 sanctioned posts. Even in the city's government schools, the number of special educators is much lower than the requirement. Despite court orders and studies that make a case for integration of children in the same classroom, those with special needs are mostly sent to specialised schools. While specialised attention for differently abled children is required in many cases, there is barely any regulatory mechanism to monitor the functioning of these schools.

Of 169 schools inspected for facilities for those with hearing impairment, 160 did not have a speech therapist and 112 did not have visual and digital signage. Most schools out of 145 schools inspected for facilities for children with autism did not have tools of educational functional, language and communication, social behaviour and motor skills assessment.

According to disability rights activist Dr Satender Singh, one of the main reasons that such few applications come to schools is the lack of inclusive and accessible infrastructure and tools in schools. ""How many schools in Delhi are even accessible for persons with disabilities and how many have qualified special educators to help these students? There are also a number of learning disorders such as dyslexia, which require special teaching and learning tools. Given the gap, parents will prefer to send their children to specialised schools,"" he said.

The government also sees the lack of awareness as a challenge. Director of Education Sanjay Goel said that the department aims to step up publicity for these seats in the coming academic year. ""We will try to increase awareness about these seats. This is also the first time that this quota is being operationalised; once more students start taking admission through it, hopefully awareness will increase and we will also be able to encourage schools to improve their infrastructure,"" he said.

The process for nursery admissions for the 2019-20 session is already underway for applicants under the general category. The directorate, meanwhile, is yet to release the admission schedule for the EWS/DG category."

There are no trained counsellors on campus, and it's largely left to ""overburdened"" teachers to look after the welfare of students. And yet, it's the teachers and staff who have ended up facing the flak for the 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas (JNVs).

An investigation by The Indian Express has revealed that in at least 32 of the 49 suicides reported from 2013 to 2017, disciplinary action -- censure, increment cut, suspension and transfer -- was initiated against either the school principal or teachers or both.

Of the 32 cases in which disciplinary action was taken, only 10 could be directly attributed to the actions of employees who were punished, according to data obtained by The Indian Express under the RTI Act and verified separately with vidyalayas from where the suicides were reported.

The Indian Express reported Monday that the reasons behind the suicides in JNVs range from family problems, unrequited love, depression, homesickness, academic pressure, humiliation by teachers and fights between friends.

Advertising

However, the onus of spotting behavioural changes, suicidal tendencies and depression in a student is on the school principal and the House Master (HM) at these institutions run by the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS), an autonomous body under the HRD Ministry tasked with running all 635 JNVs.

READ: Navodaya Vidyalayas Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh: 'Have proposed that govt deploy two full-time counsellors in each school'

Such an approach fixes the blame and not the problem, say JNV principals, who spoke to The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.

""The Samiti's instinctive reaction to a suicide is to act against the House Master and principal, even if they are not responsible for it. Principals are already under a lot of pressure to deliver good board results and teachers are overburdened with non-academic work. To expect us to also know what's going on in every child's mind is unreasonable,"" said the principal of a JNV in north India that witnessed a suicide in 2017.

An HM is a school teacher tasked with leading a 'House' that consists of a group of students. There are usually eight Houses for boys and two for girls in a JNV. The HM is suppose to be ""a parent, guide, philosopher and friend"" to each member of the House.

According to an 11-page circular issued by the Samiti in 2016 -- when suicide figures hit double digits (12) for the first time -- the HM and AHM (Assistant House Master) are supposed to interact with students regularly to assess their emotional well-being, gauge their family history through informal chats and involve the school principal if they notice behavioural changes.

Counselling sessions can be arranged ""on need basis"" for a student with suicidal tendencies, the circular states. It warns of stern action, stating that ""any negligence/ indifference/ laziness in terms of the implementation of these guidelines will be viewed seriously and the responsibility will be fixed on the employee concerned"".

However, an evaluation of the Navodaya system by Niti Aayog, released in March 2015, shows that JNV teachers are already overworked and overstressed. The study, which covered 112 teachers in 56 schools across 16 states, states that teachers are overworked because of ""house mastership and mess management"" responsibilities, which ""severely eats into the teaching time"".

Dr Rajesh Sagar, a psychiatrist with AIIMS-Delhi, says asking teachers to look for early signs of suicidal tendencies in students is not an effective preventive measure. ""Unless you are trained to spot subtle changes in behaviour, a teacher who is already pressed for time may not be able to see it,"" he said.

According to Samiti sources, roughly 200 JNV teachers, or less than 2 per cent, of the total strength of 16,000, have completed the NCERT's PG diploma course in clinical counselling over the last 15 years.

Defending the disciplinary action taken against employees in case of suicides, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh told The Indian Express: ""We are not victimising anyone. Action has been taken only in those cases where a systemic failure or error was noticed after an inquiry.""

Advertising

In the last one year, the Samiti has tried recruiting wardens for boys' hostels since it was noticed that a majority of the suicides were by boys. Also, it recently submitted a proposal to the HRD Ministry to have two full-time counsellors in each school -- while that is being discussed, another eight suicides have been reported so far this year."

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Conditions resembling a ""congested prison""

NGOs running shelters like hostels

Jayaprakash Institute of Social ChangeWhen the women were questioned, they informed the NCW Committee that the NGO workers go out and solicit donations of food and clothes for the women staying there. These shelter homes are receiving crores in funding from the Central government, and are not supposed to fund care of the women through begging for donations.Many women also complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh.The Committee found that seven of the women were intellectually disabled, and observed that this Swadhar Greh was run like a 'congested prison'.The women were not receiving proper medical care.

Ramdev's schools to be first beneficiary.

New Delhi: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev's long-drawn struggle to secure official recognition for Vedic schools and gurukuls is set to end soon, as the Modi government is ready with a Vedic Board along the lines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The board will be in charge of granting affiliation to Vedic schools and gurukuls, apart from creating more such schools. The syllabus at a Vedic school is a mix of the traditional and the modern, comprising of Indian scriptures, Vedas, Upanishads apart from basic mathematics, economics and languages among others.

There are many such schools in India almost all of which are unregulated.

Sources in the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry said the guidelines for the board's functioning have been finalised and will be released soon.

""Apart from granting affiliation to existing Vedic schools, the board's mandate would also be to set up more schools that impart modern education along with teaching Vedas to students,"" said a source familiar with the development.

""The plan has been finalised but the government is cautious in releasing it at this time because of the upcoming elections.""

Sources in the ministry also said that Ramdev's schools will be the first ones to get affiliation under the board, likely to be functional from the 2019 academic year.

Ramdev had been pushing for a separate board for Vedic schools since 2015 after he decided to open a chain of gurukuls across the country. He and his team had also held consultations with the HRD Ministry to suggest ways in which the board can be formulated.

Ramdev runs Acharyakulam, a residential Vedic school for students between classes 5 and 12 at Haridwar. He plans to establish 700 such schools across the country that will follow the Acharyakulam model.

""Swamiji (Baba Ramdev) was trying for this for a very long time and finally the government has agreed to his opinion. He gave a number of representations to the government to prove the need of such schools in the Indian education system,"" Acharya Balkrishna, Ramdev's aide and business partner told ThePrint.

""Ten schools are already working presently, one in Ranchi will take off from the next academic session.""

The HRD Ministry had started working on the board in 2016 but the project was shelved after certain objections from the then secretary, education, S.C. Khuntia, who pointed out that establishing a board would open the doors to corruption in the school education sector, sources in the ministry said.

It was revived in May after HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar discussed the setting up of the board at the 'Virat Gurukul Sammelan' where the RSS top brass and other BJP leaders had gathered. Just two days ago, on 22 December, Javadekar announced the plan during the inauguration of a school at Baruipur in West Bengal.

""We want to create a board that imparts education with a mix of knowledge from the Vedas and modern education. We are working towards creating a board that can do this,"" the minister said.

A central government panel had earlier this year suggested that children studying in madrasas and Vedic schools should be considered ""out of school"". This was one of the major suggestions that emerged in the report of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) sub-committee, which was submitted to the ministry. The CABE is the largest decision-making body on all matters related to education.

There are a large number of children attending unrecognised schools/institutions, which may or may not provide regular education. Children attending all such institutions like Vedic pathshalas, gompas, madrasas should be considered 'out of school', the report had said. The committee was headed by former MoS HRD Upendra Kushwaha.

Setting up of a separate Vedic Board will also help such schools in getting recognition."

""NDA seals deal for Lok Sabha seat-sharing in Bihar"" reads a headline in The Hindu. Hindustan Times leads with it too, reporting the alliance's reformation after Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) left to join the Congress. In the latest development, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Janata Dal (United) will take 17 seats each, while the Lok Janshakti Party -- the newest entrant into the seat sharing deal -- will field candidates for the remaining six. That makes 40 in total.

""The Bharatiya Janata Party's pact with Ram Vilas Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) has cemented the wider National Democratic Alliance equation in Bihar"", HT writes in its editorial, ""Only an inclusive NDA -- which has the BJP in senior role as the anchor but not as a hegemonic partner -- can help the party deal with the Opposition challenge.""

In its 'Explained' box, the Indian Express says, ""Ram Vilas Paswan is an important Dalit leader, and his exit would have sent a wrong signal. With the other prominent Dalit leader, Mayawati, firmly against the BJP, the ruling alliance needs a counter balance. Conceding a Rajya Sabha seat to the LJP is not a big ask for the political optics.""

The Express leads with an investigation that finds that the suicide rate in government sponsored Navodaya schools is higher than the national average, at 5.5. Of the 49 students who have committed suicide in the last 5 years, half are Dalit and tribal.

""For every one lakh students studying in these schools, almost six students committed suicide in 2017. This is slightly higher than the national suicide rate for a similar age group in 2015 -- roughly 3 suicides per lakh population aged 6 to 17 years,"" says the report.

""The causes of suicides in JNVs are disparate and range from unrequited love, family problems, corporal punishment or humiliation by teachers, academic pressure, depression, and fight between friends. Of these, the first three are cited most often as reasons behind suicides,"" adds the report.

The Times of India's biggest story of the day is the government's ""last mile push for Ayodhya resolution in SC"". Within, it writes, ""The forceful stance will reflect the state government's, as also the Modi government's, empathy for the urgency with which VHP with the strong backing of RSS -- has taken up its long pending demand for a Ram temple in Ayodhya in recent weeks.""

The BJP hasn't conceded to demands for an ordinance on the matter, ""but the anticipated thrust in the Supreme Court can well be the last opportunity to get a verdict ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections,"" writes TOI.

Also making headlines is the government's decision to monitor online content more closely. In ""Govt moves to access and trace all 'unlawful' content online"", The Indian Express reports that amendments to the Information Technology Act could ""make it mandatory for online platforms to ""proactively"" deploy technology, which would enable a ferreting of content seen as ""unlawful"". They also require end-to-end encryption to be broken so that the origin of messages can be traced.""

The report follows orders by the Union government last week, giving ten intelligence agencies the green signal to ""intercept, monitor and decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.""

TOI is not pleased and says so in its editorial. ""This needs to be tested against the recent nine-judge bench judgment of the Supreme Court, which ruled the right to privacy was integral to the fundamental right to life,"" it writes. ""At the very least, circumstances permitting such surveillance must be very clearly and narrowly defined. Moreover, a measure of judicial oversight can be brought in as well. In the US, security agencies require a court order to read unopened emails. India should consider similar safeguards,"" it said.

The acquittal of all those accused in the Sohrabuddin encounter case finds place in The Hindu's lengthy editorial, calling it the ""failure of justice"". ""It is the prosecution's duty to ensure the safety of witnesses and give them the confidence and courage to speak the truth under oath. While it is perhaps not surprising that witnesses in the police did not support the prosecution, it is disappointing that others could not be encouraged to do so.""

India Today

India Today anchor Pooja Shali discussed whether the BJP-led Union government is targeting Congress-ruled states. Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan are believed to be facing issues on the agriculture front in the middle of the rabi season due to shortage of urea in several districts.

Congress spokesperson Vinayak Dalmiya said that BJP is trying to punish the farmers while party spokesperson Aman Sinha commented that charges made against BJP government is baseless.

Dalmiya said, ""This is completely against the principle of cooperative federalism, as BJP has lost in these states due to agrarian crisis they want to punish the farmers.""

Sinha said, ""Why are only the Congress governed states facing money shortage? They are making baseless acquisitions.""

Republic TV

On his show, Republic TV anchor Arnab Goswami asked who has a bigger role in saving democracy -- the government or the opposition.

Goswami said, ""The pseudo-liberal media remained completely kept quiet when Calcutta High Court did not allow BJP to carry out rath yatra in West Bengal.""

Writer Saira Shah Halim pointed out that there is terrorism taking place in the name of cow in the country, while BJP spokesperson Syed Zafar Islam said that pseudo-liberal media does not want to talk about development work done in the last four and a half years.

Halim said, ""It's about time we rephrase our verbiage. There's no such thing as cow vigilantism, it's cow terrorism.""

Islam said, ""You don't want to talk about all the good work we have done in four and a half years. Hence, they talk about cow vigilantism.""

Aaj Tak

Aaj Tak anchor Sweta Singh interviewed Rajasthan deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on the show Seedhi Baat.

Singh asked Pilot if Congress would form a coalition to defeat the BJP-led NDA in the upcoming 2019 general elections.

Pilot replied, ""A rainbow coalition is being made in the country. Very soon you will see all the opposition parties of the country uniting.""

He also pointed out that only Congress can confront BJP at the national stage. As regional parties are also important these days, Congress is willing to ""give and take"".

When asked if Congress would be able to secure majority in the general elections, Pilot replied, ""No matter what, do remember that BJP is not going to form the government.""

The Kashmir Chamber thanked Malik for the extension of the North East Industrial Package to JK. Ahmad apprised the Governor about the need for the consequential measures required for local entrepreneurs to benefit from the package. Attention was drawn towards issues like non-availability of land, delays in essential permissions like Pollution Clearance and Power Sanction, Logistic Issues and other operational problems faced by the industrial sector.

Ahmad also urged for exercising of restraint by the armed forces while dealing with unarmed civilians as the repetitive loss of lives was a serious cause of concern. The Kashmir Chamber urged for the need of giving space for peaceful protests.

Malik was briefed about the neglect faced by the traditional Handicrafts of our State. Several suggestions were made for the revival of the Handicrafts Sector like promotion of Clusters, Reduction of GST etc. The participation in Global exhibitions and fairs for Handicraft and Tourism sector was emphasised.

While thanking the State for the prompt response for releasing of compensation to the farmers whose orchards were damaged by the snowfall, the delegation urged for early implementation of the Crop Insurance Scheme. Governor was apprised about measures taken by other states for the development of the Horticulture Sector especially Apple, Walnuts and Saffron in collaboration with the World Bank & ADB.

""Unless immediate steps are taken for investments in research and development, our horticulture sector would be nowhere in the coming future,"" KCCI said in a statement.

The Kashmir Chamber requested that experts needed to study the flood prevention measures required especially effective dredging. The President appreciated the steps taken for cleaning of the Dal Lake and urged for similar protection for other water bodies.

The potential for development of Sheep, Dairy, Fish and other Farms was also discussed and it was suggested that the Kashmir Chamber would make suggestions for formulation of a comprehensive policy in this sector, as was done in the Poultry Sector.

INOX Air Products, has started to implement its CSR campaign through Mrida, a Social Business Venture focused on sustainable and scalable holistic rural development. INOX Air Products, one of the largest manufacturers of Industrial gases in India with 36 plants spread across the country, will work with Mrida for sustainable and holistic development of selected villages and hamlets in Bokaro District of Jharkhand. The project is called ""Udaan, the Wings of Transformation"" and is focusing on bringing about a developmental change in the villages.

As a part of their CSR initiatives, INOX Air Products has started to focus on holistic rural development and initially taken up 2 villages (Jharnamuri and Bajudih) for their campaign. These are around 19 kms from Bokaro Steel Plant, where INOXAP has its on-site liquid production unit. These initiatives will be undertaken for a period of 34 months and began from June 2018.

""Since the rural areas are often the most in need of development, INOXAP decided to focus on them. We were on the lookout for a partner who could help us positively impact the lives of these communities and work closely with them for their social and economic welfare. We firmly believe that our program with Mrida will help better thelives of the people in these areas and that together we can make them a powerful and empowered community"", says Mr. Surendra Choudhary, Chief Financial Officer, INOX Air Products Pvt.

These include agri-inputs,education, sanitation, energy access, clean water supply, healthcare and hygiene initiatives, livelihood generation activities to begin with and the scope of activities will be modified as the project progresses.

""As a concerned corporate citizen, INOXAP had been committing valuable resources to ensure that the communities in and around their plants benefit from their initiatives. We will work together to ensure that a positive, measurable, scalable and sustainable Impact is created on the lives of the people, in the areas that we operate in. Mrida believes in holistic development and with INOXAP's way of thinking there is a huge synergy in what can be done. We are hopeful and our work will speak for itself in a short time"", says Mr Arun Nagpal, Co-Founder and CEO, Mrida Group.

INOXAP through Mrida has already undertaken the following for the Villages in Bokaro:

Community mobilization was the pre-requisite for sustainable development initiative at these villages. The buy in from people would only come about after they were directly involved in the decision making process. Today, villagers are a part of a Village Development Committee and take decisions about the developmentinitiatives directly in consultation with the Mrida Team.

Existing Solar LED Street Light network has been strengthened by repairing existing lights and installing new ones as per need, so that the safety and security of those in these areas can be reinforced. 100% coverage has already been achieved in both villages.

Since safety and health of the villagers is one of the main concerns, availability of clean drinking water to the households becomes very important. As a result,Solar Powered pumping and purification system plant has been installed in Jharnamuri village on a community-based model where villagers pay Rs. 20 per month from each household to the Village Development Committee for availing the services. The money thus collected is utilized for the upkeep of the systemover time and makes the intervention self-sustainable. A water purificationsystem has been installed in the Govt. Middle School for the school students. The Pipeline work for water to school toilets has also been completed.

Creating sustainable and scalable livelihood generation opportunities including encouraging micro entrepreneurship and all-round community engagement will be another area of operation. 2 Stitching centres have already been established and training program initiated for 32 students across 2 villages. Incense Sticks value addition and marketing training imparted for 30 women and local linkages being created: Business already flowing in for them.

It is planned that the following will be also focused on in the next phase:

Setting up of Solar Powered E-Hubs to provide education, entertainment and E-Commerce facilities.

These are predominantly agrarian communities and the farmers are still using traditional methods of cultivation. An in-depth agri-input program focused on bettering yields and focused on high value crops will be undertaken to improve productivity and income levels of the farmers.

Working closely with the existing state-aided primary schools to ensure that more and more children can benefit from the education imparted.

Health and Nutrition related initiatives: This will start with the health baseline survey of the villagers through medical/health camps and based on the results of the survey, subsequent interventions to improve on the basic health index would be undertaken.

Installation of Solar Water Pumping & Purification system in Village Bajudih on similar lines.

Strengthening local leadership at the Village level in the form of Village Development Committees (VDCs) to play an active role in the entire initiative. The idea is for the VDC to eventually take over ongoing activities with minimal involvement of the INOX and Mrida."

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

The Indian National Lok Dal, a party founded by former deputy prime minister Devi Lal, split in 2018 after a bitter power struggle between his two grandsons. The year also saw a series of horrific rape cases, long strikes by roadways and sanitation workers, and sportspersons making Haryana proud.

Opposition politicians conducted state-wide yatras' to keep up their attack on the Manohar Lal Khattar government over issues like law and order, farmers' problems and power supply.

INLD's Abhay Chautala, who is Leader of Opposition in Haryana Assembly, led a 'jail bharo' agitation and the 'Jan Adhikar Yatra', focusing on the unfinished Sutlej-Yamuna Link Canal.

The long-pending water-sharing project, opposed by neighbouring Punjab, was in the works even when his grandfather was chief minister, heading a Lok Dal government in the 1980s.

For the Congress, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda led the Jan Kranti Yatra', spread over seven phases in different parts of the state, berating the BJP government over unfulfilled promises.

""The BJP made tall promises to the people, but failed to fulfil them. People will vote them out in the 2019 Lok Sabha and assembly elections,"" he said at one meeting.

Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal leader has also made known that his party would field candidates in Haryana in that election.

At his rallies, Kejriwal targeted the Khattar government over the ""pathetic"" state of government schools and health centres, and pitched the AAP as an alternative.

Undeterred, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar also held roadshows across the state, promising development, a corruption-free government and an assurance to fill up what he calls the potholes dug by previous Congress government"".

But the biggest political spectacle in the state this year was the feud in the INLD -- which finally split between Ajay Chautala and Abhay Chautala, the two sons of party president Om Prakash Chautala.

The feud saw Ajay Chautala and his sons Dushyant and Digvijay being expelled from the Haryana-based party by the senior Chautala, who threw his weight behind the younger son Abhay Chautala.

The trigger was an INLD rally in Gohana in October when the supporters of the two young Chautalas hooted at their uncle Abhay Chautala.

Dushyant Chautala, the MP from Hisar, has now launched the Jannayak Janata Party, and the 30-year-old's supporters are even projecting him as the next chief minister.

The split came at a time when the parent INLD had entered into an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party and was hoping to return to power in Haryana after a 14-year hiatus. Some say the development has hit its chances.

BJP's rebel MP from Kurukshetra, Raj Kumar Saini, also floated a new outfit, the 'Loktantra Suraksha Party'. Known for his anti-Jat stand, the MP has accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of failing to address the issues concerning the Other Backward Classes.

Several rape cases shook the state in 1918.

The year began on a tragic note with an 11-year-old being raped and killed in Panipat. In May, a 17-year-old girl committed suicide after she was abducted and then raped by eight men in Mewat. In September, a 19-year-old woman from Rewari district was abducted and raped.

Among those arrested in the Riwari case was an Army man.

In April, the Haryana Assembly had passed a Bill allowing death penalty for the rape of anyone under 12, signalling that the state planned to act tough on crime against women. But the rapes continued.

The state witnessed an 18-day strike by Haryana Roadways employees, the longest ever by them, in October-November. In May, sanitation workers went on a 16-day strike.

For former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the year brought in its share of legal trouble.

The CBI filed a chargesheet against him and others over alleged irregularities in the re-allotment of an institutional plot in Panchkula to Associated Journals Limited, the publishers of Congress mouthpiece National Herald.

He also figured in an FIR over a land deal in Gurgaon, which allegedly benefitted a company associated with Robert Vadra, the brother-in-law of Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Hooda has dismissed the cases as political vendetta by the Bharatiya Janata Party.

As in past years, Haryana faced flak over stubble-burning that contributes to pollution in the region, particularly the national capital. But the state claimed the steps taken by it have helped contain the problem.

Haryana remembered Sir Chhotu Ram with Prime Minister Narendra Modi unveiling a 64-foot statue of the peasant leader at his native village in Rohtak district, a much-awaited Kundli-Manesar-Palwal expressway was thrown open to public, Bahadurgarh got the metro train, student polls were held after gap of two decades and mayors were picked through direct elections for the first time.

But what brought cheer to many Haryanvis was the performance of its athletes at international events, keeping intact the reputation of the state as a powerhouse of sports in the country. Eighteen Haryana athletes won medals at the 18th Asian Games in Jakarta.

Manu Bhaker, a class 11 girl from Jhajjar, became a new shooting star. In Mexico, she became the youngest Indian to win an ISSF World Cup gold.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

Language is a tool to express the feelings through a set pattern of words or the method of human communication, either spoken or written. However, when it comes to the mother language, the words and their method of communication become identity. The concept of mother tongue is a fascinating aspect of language that has transcended generations. Similarly, in Jammu Dogri is more than just a means of communication. It is a repository of Dogras collective history and heritage. It has provided Dogras an identity and a focus that binds the Dogras together. Over the past some decades, the language has drastically collapsed in which the language is howling for its existence.

Dogri and Punjabi are sister languages, before the 8th schedule, Dogri was considered as a dialect of Punjabi. Where Punjabi has become one of the most spoken languages in the world, Dogri is on the verge of extinction. Mostly spoken in J&K, it is also spoken in some parts of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and in some parts of Pakistan. The language has seen a certain decline among its speakers and is losing its importance gradually. There are many reasons behind its downfall, which needs to be worked upon or else the language may die in the coming years. One of the major reasons behind Dogri losing its importance is, lack of interest among youth, modernization, cultural intelligence and globalization are posing hindrance and have made the survival of such languages even more difficult. Children, prefer to speak languages which would strengthen them for the competition they would face in their respective fields. They face unprecedented pressure to adopt common languages that are used in Government, technology and entertainment.

The bedrock of a language depends on the folklore of the region, when the culture of a particular region is rich, it will never get suppressed by the modernization, furthermore it will fuse with it, leading to a phenomenal outcome, and will make it a delight for the people belonging to other cultures, they too will start developing an affinity towards it. Language dies, when inhabitants get detached from their culture, and embraces some other or might even develop a new one.

Our language is an expression of ourselves and to preserve it, is our responsibility which connects us to our culture. Once we start thinking that the language is no longer a need of us is a day when we are into a deep threat. We are living in a 21st century where westernization has started dominated us and escaping this whirlpool is impossible unless people don't grasp their culture firmly. Upcoming generations are well versed with other cultures prevailing, but at the same time they must be bracketed with their mother tongue.

Jammu, which was mainly a Dogra dominated region of Jammu & Kashmir has become so diversified, that it could be called as a cultural melting pot, where people have settled down from the different parts of the state. It is due to its stature of being a capital for six months and moreover acceptance among people towards their fellow citizens from all over the state.

We can easily find the linguistic diversity of Jammu and Kashmir where one can get the difference of accent. In Jammu region most of the youngsters are in illusion that if we get well educated, we can get anything but forgetting the fact that the without the knowledge of their own language, their existence ceases.

In Jammu, one can easily find the linguistic diversity and at the same time we are having many languages in our own state which include Dogri, Kashmiri, Pahari, Bhadarwahi, Ladakkhi, Kishtwari, Balti, Hindi, Gojri and Urdu but in Jammu which is known as the Duggar land have its language called 'Dogri' which was recognized in 8th Schedule of the Indian Constitution on 22nd of December, 2003 in which lots of efforts have been made by the stalwarts of Jammu who took Dogri to the International heights. Since the last couple of years we are finding that there is a sudden decline in Dogri language in which Jammu feels offensive to speak Dogri and think that it's insulting to speak it in a public domain.

Sharing his views on Dogri Language, President Dogri Sanstha, Jammu Prof. Lalit Mangotra said, ""we want to send our wards to the school where English is used as a medium of communication, everyone wants to compete with the world. Everyone is looking for the best school in Jammu, taking the children away from Dogri.

Govt. never pays attention towards the showcasing of rich sugar coated Dogri language. There is a Government order which was passed in 2002 and 2006 in which they have made Dogri mandatory in schools but nobody has paid any heed towards its implementation and promotion of Dogri Language. Today 11th and 12th classes are having Dogri subject which is also taught in Government schools only."" It is the responsibility of every individual to put in their efforts to promote their mother tongue. ""Language could be saved if people love it from the bottom of their heart, the way Bongs or Gujjus do. We have no culture of reading Dogri Literature, literature is considered boring perhaps. We need to give space to Dogri in our houses with love and affection as nobody will come from outside to teach us for the preservation of Dogri language. It was in 1940 when Dogri Literature came into existence; there were only some books at that point of time, but look at the volume of books now which are uncountable, moreover the writers themselves would never ask their children to go through them. We had a newspaper called 'Jammu Prabhat' which was published daily in Jammu region but unfortunately due to the negligence of the state as well as the masses, they had to shut it down,"" says Prof. Lalit Mangotra, a Sahitya Academy Awardee.

We have many Dogri writers who have given their life and contributed immensely for the promotion of Dogri language and its literature but unfortunately we have also those people who write for its publication with photo and self glorification leading to the mediocrity in Dogri literature.

Language is our identity and reflection of our coexistence and one must understand the fact that without engraving and promoting the Dogri language, we cannot change anything and stand nowhere and will have identity crisis one day as we all are leaving our roots which is our language.

With the objective to recognise the dynamism and enthusiasm shown by the government and major enterprises in aggressively pursuing their plans of digital transformation, The Indian Express Group and the Government of West Bengal jointly organised the Emerging Tech Conclave, in Kolkata. The two-day conference saw partcipation of senior leaders from the state government, including Dr Amit Mitra, Minister-in-Charge, IT, Electronics and e-Governance; Finance; Industry, Commerce & Enterprises; Micro Small and Medium Enterprise and Textiles, Government of West Bengal, and Debashis Sen, IT Secretary, Government of West Bengal, along with many illustrious names from the Indian corporate sector.

In his keynote address, Sen focused on the use of emerging technologies, e-commerce model for e-rickshaw services, a hackathon and Python coding classes in schools. ""We are having a hackathon which we call 'Bengalathon'. One of the problems that we have given to the participants to solve is 'totos-on-call'. Can we not have an e-marketplace for totos? Most of these totowallahs don't have smartphones, and no app runs on a non-smartphone. So how do we solve it? That is the challenge that we have posed in our hackathon, or Bengalathon,"" Sen stated.

Further, Sen spoke about creating an ecosystem for emerging technologies which will directly provide jobs and development in the economy. ""The government, through Webel, has already started an animation academy called Webel DQE Animation Academy. Moreover, we are eager to propose that 'Bengal means Blockchain', and are considering blockchain use cases in the government sector for property, financial transactions, crowdfinancing the public projects, and much more,"" he mentioned.

The conclave was also attended by Anant Goenka, Executive Director, The Indian Express Group and other dignitaries. A panel discussion, 'Idea Exchange with CEOs', was moderated by Goenka. Manish Prakash, Managing Director - Healthcare, Education and Public Sector, Microsoft India; Kamal Nath, CEO, Sify Technologies; Deepak Maheshwari, Director - Government Affairs, India, ASEAN & China and Srikanth RP, Group Editor, Express Computer & CRN, were part of the panel. The panelists discussed various challenges faced by government organisations and how emerging technologies could help in solving those issues. Nath said, ""Emerging technologies are the next big wave to bring about change; they are unavoidable for economies and nations. These will create new jobs and would need a new and smart approach. Artificial intelligence would require a lot of data made available to everyone, everywhere, and tools and algorithms to provide smart intelligence from data."" The panel discussion concluded by giving the success recipe for West Bengal to be the technology hub.

Emerging technologies

A panel discussion on 'Using emerging technologies (AI, blockchain, IoT, analytics) for digital transformation' was moderated by Kirti Patil, Executive Vice President & CTO, Kotak Life Insurance. Basant Chaturvedi, Head - Information & Communication Technology, Perfetti Van Melle India spoke about the capabilities of AI to churn huge data and how organisations with structured data can bring beneficial results. Hiren Shah, Head- IT, Reliance Nippon Life Asset Management and Bhupendra Pant, former CIO & VP, IT, Welspun Corp were the other panelists. ""Businesses need to first identify the business pain point to roll out AI. It is also critical to clean up data. If data is treated the right way, then it can be next to oil. Startups are at the edge, with the best technologies. Businesses need to change their vendor strategies,"" Chaturvedi added.

In his session, Alok Khanna, Executive Director - IS, Indian Oil Corporation, spoke about how technology can make an impact, with the government and the public sector taking firm decisions to bring about change.

People-centric applications

The highlight of ETC 2018 was a fireside chat between Goenka and Dr Mitra, who highlighted how the West Bengal government is focusing on people-centric applications in adopting emerging technologies and its goal is to take these technologies to the grassroot level.

Responding to a question raised by Goenka on how difficult it had been for the state government to work with major IT companies, Dr Mitra stated, ""After seeing the transparent tendering process here, technology companies are flocking to Bengal to compete for orders.""

Speaking about adopting emerging technologies, the Minister said, ""We are looking at where we can apply blockchain. We have massive amounts of land records and want to explore whether it is possible to use blockchain for this; and the healthcare sector. We are also looking at adopting blockchain in the city's traffic control system."" In the process of soil testing for agricultural growth in the state, the government will explore high-end technologies like AI.

The Minister said it was not easy for the Trinamool Congress government to change the mindsets of the people and the government employees after coming to power in 2011, by defeating the 34-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Front. ""I think the change has been huge, the challenge was also huge. The year before we came to office, the man-days lost were '78 lakh due to strikes. It took two years to bring that to around 5,000 man-days lost in a full year. Within the fourth year, it reduced to zero, and has persisted to be zero,"" said Dr Mitra.

The keynote address on the second day was given by VS Parthasarathy, Group CIO & Group CFO, Mahindra & Mahindra, who spoke about how traditional businesses get disrupted by just one spark of the digital. ""Emerging technologies are impacting the society, people, governance and businesses,"" he said, adding that he believed in the federation and enabling the workforce, by allowing them to learn and re-learn.

A power discussion by Avaya, was attended by IT leaders from across the country. Adarsh Kaul, India & SAARC Lead Marketing, Avaya spoke about the perceptions organisations consider when they are looking at deepening the customer experience. He further interacted with the participants in order to understand their approach on digital to enhance the customer experience.

Bibek Agarwala, CFO, Raymond won the 'Express Digital CFO Awards,' hosted at the conference.

Rise of the digital CFO

The conference explored the rise of the digital CFO, who plays a strategic role in data-driven value creation (turning data into insights), cross-functional collaboration (enabling real-time virtual collaboration while being compliant) and cybersecurity. For CFOs, digital technologies will also play a key role in capital allocation, measurement of value creation and in proactively addressing risk and better management using centralised dashboards and digital workflows; and getting real-time alerts using analytics. A panel discussion on 'How CFOs are using digital technologies to transform finance' was moderated by V S Parthasarathy, Group CIO & Group CFO, Mahindra & Mahindra. The participants were Rajendra Kamath, Group CFO, Reliance Retail; Ramesh Bafna, Senior Director Finance, Flipkart; Indroneel Dutt, CFO, Cleartrip; Bibek Agarwala, CFO, Raymond; and Rashmi Joshi, CFO and Whole Time Director, Castrol India.

Joshi said, ""AI and robotics will reduce the decision-making time. Emerging technologies offer numerous pockets to drive the business, provided the technology is chosen carefully."" Agarwala, added, ""Do not forget the existing business, please adopt the technology and do not just straight away change. Be flexible, take the risk, but not at the stake of compliance.""

In his special session on 'New age CFO: Digital transformation - strategy, approach, and tools', Srinivas Phatak, Group CFO, Hindustan Unilever spoke about the new dimensions introduced by data and technology, which are leading to value creation and protection. ""In this digital world, CFOs are required to be pragmatic and disruptors, at the same time, being reluctant and risk-taking. Harnessing the power of data is an asset for organisations. The fundamental change is coming through the adoption of technology to create and protect the value. Finance roles have to be strategic leaders who partner with the business and run it,"" he said.

In a special address on 'Best practices from digital transformation,' Jayanta Banerjee, Global CIO, Tata Steel, affirmed that digital transformation cannot happen without a strong IT background, as digital has to ride on a fundamental IT backbone. ""IT and digital vision is aligned to the organisation's long-term objectives and has to move the transformation from instinct to initiative. We have gone 100 per cent on the cloud, which is giving the company scale, speed and agility,"" Banerjee mentioned.

""IT and finance; one is blood and other is flesh, and together they keep the organisation breathing and beating,"" stated Parthasarathy in his closing remarks.

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

The Government High School at Attavara in Hassan taluk gives a tough fight to private schools nearby by securing good results in SSLC, besides organising some unique activities to improve the learning ability of students. Unlike many schools in rural areas, the school registered 100% results in SSLC this year. Of the 29 students who took the exams, 27 secured first-class marks.

""This time our target is 100% results will all first class,"" said K.P. Narayana, headmaster. Last year, we had 98% results and constant efforts by teachers helped improve the results this year. ""There is a notion among the public that rural students do not study hard. We want to prove that wrong. We, teachers, maintain a good rapport with students and their parents and monitor their studies regularly,"" he said. Interestingly, teachers take out their personal time to visit their students late in the evening. Sometimes students are surprised to see their teachers on their doorstep. ""We go to their place and speak to their parents. The exercise helps us develop a contact with the parents and also see if students set aside enough time for studies at home,"" he said.

Recently, the school conducted a rangoli competition for students. It was unique because the students were told to draw the diagrams they study as part of their science syllabus. A student drew an image of the brain, nervous system, and respiratory system using colours provided by the teachers.

After school hours, students of classes 8, 9, and 10 have to take part in group studies. With the help of villagers, the school has got special benches on the campus for evening classes. All 98 students attend the classes, before leaving for home. H.L. Nagaraj, Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, has taken a special interest in improving basic amenities in the school.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education.

Beginning in 1968, India has had two education policies. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government constituted a committee under the chairmanship of late T.S.R. Subramanian to evolve a new policy. By the time the committee submitted its report, the Union HRD minister was changed.

So, another committee was constituted, this time under the chairmanship of K. Kasturirangan to formulate the new education policy. In July this year, the committee got a third extension.

The current government has only a few months to go. One fervently hopes that this report also does not meet the same fate as the one by T.S.R. Subramanian.

However, the key question is whether there is a need for a new education policy at all? It is undoubtedly true that what has so far happened in the education sector leaves a lot to be desired. What also needs to be considered is whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or are there other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs? What is the rationale for a new policy in the school education sector?

During the past decade, the educational infrastructure (like school buildings) has certainly shown remarkable improvement, although there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the midday meal, we have managed to get the child to the school. However, the quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools has left a lot to be desired.

The learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite an enormous amount of investment. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels. However, this has not solved the problem of quality.

To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of 8 million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in the skewed distribution of teachers in most of the states as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little to salvage these shortcomings. In fact, in some cases, like no-detention policy and mandatory provision relating to qualification and number of teachers, it created more problems than it solved. A tedious process of amendment had to be resorted to correct some of the wrongs.

Most of the action relating to education lies in the states. Moreover, India is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, there are chances that he or she will be punished, but some states in northern India are notorious for teacher absenteeism. Although the situation is now improving, it remains a big challenge in many states. Many teachers get away with playing truant. There are also instances of teachers employing a 'substitute' to represent them and even teach on their behalf. What quality of education can be expected from such so-called substitute teachers?

Can a new education policy solve the problems that beset this sector? Problems vary from region to region. If policies were to solve the problems of the country, they would have all been solved long ago. There should be just a short policy statement outlining the objectives: Providing quality education to every child in the country. Instead, what is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining what needs to be done, how will it be done, who will do it, and, by when will it be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed.

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood, and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, transfer and posting, engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at. An action plan for each state will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the central government and the respective state governments.

A beginning was made in this regard for the states of Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh. The one relating to J&K is apparently being implemented, but UP is languishing. Such plans will have to be made for and in consultation with each state and their execution closely monitored. Intervention for each state will vary.

Unlike the current dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among states. The whole approach has to be outcome-based rather than input-based, as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the Western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, New Zealand, Holland and all the lands of the world, but not at our own motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country, but has so far gone unnoticed. A new 'policy' can't help in this regard. What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these homegrown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice. What is also required is to learn from states, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable state-level interventions both at administrative and financial levels.

Policy debates are always welcome and should happen, but what is required urgently is an action plan in consultation with all the stakeholders as has been done for a couple of states already. What is required is making things happen on the ground.

For Komal*, a student of class II at a government school in south Delhi, her pink bag with Barbie doll painted on its front side is not less than a treasure.

Everyday Komal carries the bag on her shoulders, stuffed with at least eight to nine books and copies as she walks up to her school. 'Apart from regular set of books, I carry a diary as well for preparing notes', says Komal as we discuss her daily routine.

Class II Student Carrying a Bag Equivalent to Class IX

With Komal's bag weighing 4.6 kg, she is, unknowingly of course, carrying more than twice the weight that has been prescribed by the Delhi government recently.

In a circular dated 1 December 2018, the Delhi government fixed the weight of school bags for students of classes I to X. For students of classes I and II, the circular states that their bags should not weigh more than 1.5 kg. State governments, including Delhi, have come up with guidelines on the weight of school bags after they were told to do so by the HRD Ministry.

At 4.6 kg, Komal is carrying a bag equivalent to that of a class IX student!

For other classes the maximum weight of school bag, as approved by the state government is as follows:

Classes III to V: 2-3 KgClasses VI to VII: 4 KgClasses VIII to IX: 4.5 KgClass X: 5 Kg

In the same government school in south Delhi, students of class I were sitting on top of a cotton durrie spread across the floor. At 2.1 kg, Leena*, a student of class I, may not be facing any health problem but technically speaking, even she is carrying a bag daily, more than the prescribed weight limit.

Extra Diary Needed for Notes

Himanshi*, a student of class VI in a Rajkiya Kanya Ucch Madhyamik Vidyalaya (government school with classes upto XII) aspires to become a doctor. She doesn't like it when her bag is lighter as compared to other days when it weighs 5.2 kg. A heavy bag gives this sixth grader an assurance that she will do well in exams and fulfill her dream one day.

With five books and an equal number of copies, Himanshi's bag also doesn't comply with the weight limit, as has been suggested by the Delhi government.

""At times, the bag is heavy, but I don't complain as everyone at home will start worrying unnecessarily. After joining a learning center that's being run by an NGO, I prefer carrying an extra copy and diary.""Himanshi (Student, Class VI)

This teaching centre where Himanshi spends an hour daily after school helped in clearing her doubts on LCM (Least Common Multiple) problems in Maths and clarified her doubts regarding identification of a proper noun.

So, that extra diary and copy, meant for preparing notes at the training centre, are something Himanshi can't leave behind at home.

Students in the Dark About New Guidelines

Most of the students that The Quint spoke to were not aware about recent guidelines nor were they told about permissible limit regarding the weight of bags by their respective teachers. Due permission was taken from the principal in south Delhi as well as the mentor of the training centre being run by an NGO after which the interviews of students were recorded.

On being asked how the school will ensure the policy on weight of school bags is implemented in letter and spirit, the principal of an MCD school in south Delhi said:

""We are aware of the recent circular and would be discussing with our staff as to how we can implement the same.""Principal of a govt school in south Delhi

According to an activist associated with an NGO that provides teaching facilities at under-resourced schools, an initiative related to cupboards didn't work out.

'We encouraged students to keep books in a cupboard at TFI-certified classrooms but soon some students started complaining after their books went missing', says the activist who has worked with schools earlier in Ahmedabad and is now managing a training center in Delhi.

Is 'Support Material' to be Blamed for Extra Weight?

For Monalisa*, who would be sitting for board exams in less than three months, it is mandatory to carry books of all the subjects to school daily.

""I have six subjects to study, so, I carry all the notebooks and books along with tiffin and a geometry box. It's actually the Maths and Science books that are quite heavy.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

On being asked whether her friends also carry books of all subjects to school, Monalisa said, 'it's even worse as other students also carry support material for the subjects of Maths, Science and Social Studies'.

Usually students at government schools prefer NCERT textbooks but some schools also distribute separate books of different subjects, commonly referred to as 'supporting material'.

The supporting material usually has chapters in condensed form with brief pointers and has objective as well as subjective questions in order to give students a sense of the exam paper.

""It's the teachers at our school who suggested that NCERT textbooks are not sufficient and therefore, we prefer 'support material'. When the session began, we were given only textbooks but since exams are drawing near, we have now been given support material as well for all the subjects except Hindi and Sanskrit.""Monalisa, Student (Class X)

Private Schools Fall Prey to Publishers' Demands

While government schools don't mind handing out extra books in the name of 'support material', private schools often fall prey to publishers who offer more lucrative deals.

An educationist who has been working with government schools in Delhi since last two years told The Quint:

""Private schools do follow the syllabus which has been prescribed. However, at times, these schools prescribe books that are not part of the curriculum as they get a commission, and this also results in heavier bags.""

Demand for Re-structuring the Syllabus

For Sharmila, whose children study in class VI, VIII and X respectively, packing bag as per the school time-table is among her foremost priorities.

Compared to the pressure that kids endure these days, measures such as limiting the weight of school bags seem half-hearted to parents like Sharmila.

""They should do something about the syllabus, nothing will happen with just reducing the weight of bags."" Sharmila, Parent

It seems that the policy-makers should have spent more time on the weighty issue of course and figuring out a way of embracing smart classroom instead of merely calibrating bags based on weight!

ThePrint asks: Should Karnataka govt push for onion, garlic in midday meal or let ISKCON follow own plan?

H.D. Kumaraswamy

Chief Minister of Karnataka

Onions and garlic help maintain good health. So, the question I would like to raise is, why should it be a problem in adding it in the midday meals that are served to children in the state?

Let food experts and doctors also explain the benefits. Food experts should advise the government whether to use these ingredients. Karnataka government is seeking the opinions of dietitians, food scientists and others on the advantages and disadvantages of onion and garlic. Then the government will take a call on what has to be done and whether other ingredients can substitute onions and garlic.

Let there be a debate on this on a public platform with all the stakeholders involved and then arrive at a decision.

Naveena Neerada Dasa

Head of communications, ISKCON

ISKCON is committed to feeding hot nutritious meals as prescribed by the MHRD and the state government.

In the last 18 years, we have put all effort to ensure that every child gets a nutritious meal. A lot of investment has gone into the infrastructure for cooking and providing hot meals.

We ensure that meals are cooked in the most hygienic conditions and we spare no effort. Akshaya Patra always feels that feeding the hungry is not a business but our social responsibility. Governments across the state have appreciated our efforts to give the best to children.

Basavaraju R

Executive director, Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM)

I would say that the government should not insist, but persuade ISKCON to include these ingredients.

We know that garlic and onions are good and many dieticians say that. ISKCON maintains a very high-quality standard, and so, the government has no other option in those five districts that they serve in.

On the other hand is they insisted, I think ISKCON may agree. They should also respect dietary habits.

Children do consume it, but it would also be extreme to say that ISKCON should be forced to serve egg or meat. It will be against their philosophy. It is better to leave this decision on whether these ingredients are a must to the food experts.

We could also look at if onions and garlic can be made in powder form and added later when the food reaches the venue.

Onion and garlic is not as much a source of nutrition, as it is a taste enhancer. If the government wants to take the decision of stopping ISKCON's good service, then it will also have to take up additional responsibilities of hygiene and nutrition. Teachers will be additionally burdened. That's not fair. We should see if dialogue works, if not, we should explore innovative options.

Rohini Swamy

Associate editor, ThePrint

The controversy over using onion and garlic in midday meals has seen enough debate, but the bigger question is whether those who are availing the service are satisfied or not.

The Karnataka government should seek opinion of those who are involved in the scheme to understand whether the meals really offer a balanced diet to children or not. While many diet specialists say that onion and garlic are just taste enhancers and can be compensated with other food ingredients, a scientific approach to this issue is needed.

Another important point to note is that Akshaya Patra has been maintaining high standards of food quality control. This has been one of the primary reasons why the government is hesitant in taking any action against the NGO. Nearly one lakh children are served food under the midday meal scheme daily by Akshaya Patra, and in the last 18 years, there have been no major complaints against the quality or quantity of the food served. Akshaya Patra maintains that they follow the standards set by the MHRD.

With political parties using this issue as a weapon on target each other, children should be caught in this crossfire.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

While Maruti Suzuki is undecided on where to relocate its Gurgaon plant, most workers are believed to prefer Dharuhera in Haryana, persons familiar with the views indicated to FE. The Gurgaon plant is being relocated following complaints of traffic congestion from civic bodies and local residents. The Dharuhera site is approximately 40 km away from the Gurgaon facility and the land has been offered by the Haryana government. Other options given by the government are in Karnal, Rohtak, Faridabad and Sohna.

""The problem with far off locations such as Rohtak, Karnal and Faridabad is majorly with the permanent workers who have managed to buy their own house in Gurgaon over a period of years and it would be impossible to commute daily from these locations for work,"" one source said.

Maruti Suzuki India declined to comment on queries sent.

""The favourable location is Dharuhera for us (permanent workers), as there is a possibility of daily commuting, although there still are problems like extended hours due to travel,"" said Rajesh Kumar, president, Maruti Udyog Kamgar Union.

The Gurgaon plant has around 2,400 permanent workers and over 4,500 temporary labours. The facility manufactures over 6 lakh units after it reduced output by dismantling the second line of production.

Even for the contract workers or others who live in a rented accomodation, the shift to these three locations will be problematic as their children will have to change schools and working wives will also have to suffer, another person said, on condition of anonymity.

The opinion at the plant is, however, divided, as the contract workers who are living here without family members do not have a problem moving to any location in the state, he added. Kumar said around 80% of the permanent workers have bought house in Gurgaon and some are still paying their EMIs and shifting to far off location would add an additional burden in the form of rent. The transfer would only be smooth if the company arranges for accomodation for its workers, he added.

The company's Gurgaon plant is the oldest in the country, built in 1980s, following a second plant in Manesar and third in Gujarat. Across its two plants in Gurgaon and Manesar, the company has a production capacity of 15 lakh per annum and with the help of the Gujarat plant, the company aims to increase the capacity to 22.5 lakh vehicles per annum by 2020.

An industry expert, who did not wish to be identified said, shifting of the Gurgaon plant is necessary for the company if it wants to grow in terms of production and innovation. ""The resistance from workers is natural in situations like these but I am sure the company will find a solution to it,"" he added."

It is the largest public gathering and collective act of faith, anywhere in the world. The Mela draws tens of millions of pilgrims over the course of approximately 55 auspicious days to bathe at the sacred confluence of the Ganga, the Yamuna, and the mystical Sarasvati. Primarily, this congregation includes Ascetics, Saints, Sadhus, Sadhvis, Kalpvasis, and Pilgrims from all walks of life.

Kumbh Mela is a religious pilgrimage that is celebrated four times over a course of 12 years. The geographical location of Kumbh Mela spans over four locations in India and the Mela site keeps rotating between one of the four pilgrimage places on four sacred rivers as listed below:

Each site's celebration is based on a distinct set of astrological positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the Jupiter. The celebrations occur at the exact moment when these positions are fully occupied, as it is considered to be the holiest time in Hinduism.

Why in News? One of the most active volcanoes of Indonesia, Mount Soputan volcano, erupted recently. It is located on the Sulawesi island in Indonesia.

Background: Indonesia sit along the Ring of Fire region, an area where most of the world's volcanic eruptions occur. The Ring of Fire has seen a large amount of activity in recent days, but Indonesia has been hit hard due to its position on a large grid of tectonic plates.

Vulnerable: Indonesia is at the meeting point of three major continental plates - the Pacific, the Eurasian and the Indo-Australian plates - and the much smaller Philippine plate. As a result, several volcanoes on the Indonesian islands are prone to erupting, with Bali's Mt Agung taking the headlines last year and in 2018. Indonesia is home to roughly 400 volcanoes, out of which 127 are currently active, accounting for about a third of the world's active volcanoes.

The Ring of Fire is a Pacific region home to over 450 volcanoes, including three of the world's four most active volcanoes - Mount St. Helens in the USA, Mount Fuji in Japan and Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines. It is also sometimes called the circum-Pacific belt.

Around 90% of the world's earthquakes occur in the Ring of Fire, and 80% of the world's largest earthquakes. The 40,0000 kilometre horse-shoe-shaped ring loops from New Zealand to Chile, passing through the coasts of Asia and the Americas on the way.

It stretches along the Pacific Ocean coastlines, where the Pacific Plate grinds against other, smaller tectonic plates that form the Earth's crust - such as the Philippine Sea plate and the Cocos and Nazca Plates that line the edge of the Pacific Ocean.

The people most at risk from activity in the Ring of Fire are in the US west coast, Chile, Japan and island nations including the Solomon Islands. These areas are most at risk because they lie on so-called subduction zones - which are boundaries that mark the collision between two of the planet's tectonic plates.

The Ring of Fire is the result from subduction of oceanic tectonic plates beneath lighter continental plates. The area where these tectonic plates meet is called a subduction zone.

The world's deepest earthquakes happen in subduction zone areas as tectonic plates scrape against each other - and the Ring of Fire has the world's biggest concentration of subduction zones.

Mains Question: The greatest concentration of volcanoes is located in the Circum - Pacific region, known as 'Pacific Ring of Fire'. Examine why and also explain features of these volcanoes.

Context: Telangana TRS chief K Chandrasekhar Rao has called for an economic and political overhaul in India. KCR's pitch, like that of many regional leaders, is an increase in state autonomy by weakening the concurrent list.

The Constitution of India has provided for a division of powers between the Central and state governments. Under the Seventh Schedule, there are three lists - the Union, State and Concurrent.

Since 1950, the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution has seen a number of amendments. The Union List and Concurrent List have grown while subjects under the State List have gradually reduced.

The 42nd Amendment Act was perhaps one of the most controversial. Effected in 1976 during the Emergency by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, the amendment restructured the Seventh Schedule ensuring that State List subjects like education, forest, protection of wild animals and birds, administration of justice, and weights and measurements were transferred to the Concurrent List.

Former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister CN Annadurai was one of the first to advocate for state autonomy and federalism at the Centre. ""It will be sufficient if the Centre retains only such powers as are necessary for preserving the unity and integrity of the country, leaving adequate powers to the states,"" he said in 1967.

Taking his idea forward, the Tamil Nadu government under M Karunanidhi constituted the PV Rajamannar Committee to look into Centre-State relations. While the Committee submitted its reports in 1971, the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly adopted a resolution three years later demanding that the Centre accept the state's views on state autonomy and the recommendations of the Rajamannar Committee. The Rajamannar Committee spurred other states to voice their opposition to the Centre's encroachment on subjects that were historically under the state's purview.

PM Indira Gandhi had constituted the Sarkaria Commission to look into Centre-State relations. However, the recommendations of the Sarkaria Commission were not implemented by successive central governments.

Mains Question: Examine whether Article 246 is the cornerstone of centre state legislative relations? Discuss whether Concurrent list created confusion with respect to extent of legislative power of centre and states?

Context: over 12,000 women in the US have sued Johnson & Johnson over claims that the talcum powder manufactured by them is the prime cause behind their ovarian cancer. A recent investigation by Reuters claimed that the talcum powder was contaminated by carcinogenic asbestos, making it poisonous and life-threatening for women using it on themselves.

Talc is a mineral in clay mined from underground deposits. It's the softest mineral known to man and that makes it useful in a wide range of consumer and industrial products.

Asbestos is also found underground, and veins of it can often be found in talc deposits, leading to a risk of cross-contamination, geologists say.

Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: i.e., long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic ""fibrils"" that can be released by abrasion and other processes.

They are commonly known by their colors, as blue asbestos, brown asbestos, white asbestos, and green asbestos.

Inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious and fatal illnesses including lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis).

Countries settled on most of the tricky elements of the ""rulebook"" for putting the 2015 Paris agreement into practice. This includes how governments will measure, report on and verify their emissions-cutting efforts, a key element because it ensures all countries are held to proper standards and will find it harder to wriggle out of their commitments. This global deal is meant for climate actions by all the countries across the globe post-2020.

The Katowice package includes guidelines that will operationalize the transparency framework. It sets out how countries will provide information about their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) that describe their domestic climate actions. This information includes mitigation and adaptation measures as well as details of financial support for climate action in developing countries.

Besides transparency framework, the Katowice package also includes guidelines that relate to the process for establishing new targets on finance from 2025 onwards to follow-on from the current target of mobilizing $100 billion per year from 2020 to support developing countries.

It also includes how to conduct the Global Stocktake (GST) of the effectiveness of climate action in 2023 and how to assess progress on the development and transfer of technology.

The global rules are important to ensure that each tonne of emissions released into the atmosphere is accounted for. In this way, progress towards the emission limitation goals of the Paris Agreement can be accurately measured. Currently, climate actions of rich nations for pre-2020 period are being guided by the Kyoto Protocol.

There was a row over carbon credits, which are awarded to countries for their emissions-cutting efforts and their carbon sinks, such as forests, which absorb carbon. These credits count towards countries' emissions-cutting targets. Brazil, which hopes to benefit from its large rainforest cover, insisted on a new form of wording that critics said would allow double counting of credits, undermining the integrity of the system. This issue has been put off until next year.

Largely absent from these talks, which had a technical focus, was the key question of how countries will step up their targets on cutting emissions. On current targets, the world is set for 3C of warming from pre-industrial levels, which scientists say would be disastrous, resulting in droughts, floods, sea level rises and the decline of agricultural productivity.

The key deadline is 2020, when countries must show they have met targets set a decade ago for cutting their emissions, and when they must affirm new, much tougher targets.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the global body of the world's leading climate scientists, warned two months ago that allowing warming to reach 1.5C above pre-industrial levels would have grave consequences, including the die-off of coral reefs and devastation of many species.

If we extrapolate from the IPCC's findings, the world has little more than a decade to bring emissions under control and halve them, which would help to stabilise the climate.

After years in which the world's carbon emissions appeared to be stabilising, they are on the rise again. Coal use continues and oil is still the engine of much of the world's economy. Clean energy is coming on-stream at a faster rate than many predicted, and the costs of it have come down rapidly, but its adoption needs to be speeded up.

Infrastructure, such as energy generation plants, transport networks and buildings, is a central issue: infrastructure built now to rely on high-carbon energy effectively locks in high emissions for decades to come. Some people are also saying we need to invest in projects to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

The UN will meet again next year in Chile to thrash out the final elements of the Paris rulebook and begin work on future emissions targets. But the crunch conference will come in 2020, when countries must meet the deadline for their current emissions commitments and produce new targets for 2030 and beyond that go further towards meeting scientific advice.

That conference may be held in the UK or Italy, both of which have bid to be hosts. The UK's intention in offering to host is to signal it will retain its role on the world stage after Brexit. The event may also provide a welcome change from wranglings over Brexit and intractable trade deals.

Mains Question: The Rule book agreed to in COP 24, is not ambitious enough to prevent the dangerous effects of global warming. Critically analyze.

In the context of establishing quality residential schools for the promotion of education, Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) for ST students are set up in States/UTs with provisioning of funds through ""Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution"".

The establishing of EMRSs is based on demand of the concerned States/UTs with availability of land as an essential attribute.

Schools run by the West Bengal government will soon have to put up a notice in classrooms, with detailed information about the curricula and chapters that would be taught by the teachers during a particular semester, an official said.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government is under pressure from civil society organisations to cancel its midday meal contract with the Akshaya Patra Foundation over the latter's refusal to use onion and garlic in the preparations it offers students.

In a letter to the H.D. Kumaraswamy government, the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food campaign have said that ""religious diktats cannot supersede the application of established principles of the right... to midday meals schemes"".

Akshaya Patra, a non-profit run by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), a partner in the midday meal scheme across the country, oversees five districts in Karnataka -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru -- where it serves an estimated 4.43 lakh government school students.

Dr Vandana Prasad, the joint convenor of the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, said this was ""yet another instance of Akshaya Patra refusing to sign a memorandum of understanding on the basis of their organisational principles"".

""We are talking about the basic principles of right to food..."" she said.

""Why should children from five districts be discriminated against only because they are being served by Akshaya Patra,"" she asked. ""It is important to understand that they cannot curtail an individual's freedom of choice to eat what they want.

""After all... it is the taxpayers' money that is being used to provide for the midday meal scheme, so who is Akshaya Patra to decide on their behalf?""

The administration is reportedly not ready to snap the contract with Akshaya Patra yet. The midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools, said an official from the chief minister's office, adding that a decision of this magnitude should be taken carefully.

However, the row is holding up the signing of the agreement for 2018-19, even though the agency continues to serve midday meals in its designated areas.

The row began with the state government issuing a recommendation to partner organisations of the midday meal to include onion and garlic in the food preparations.

The recommendation was based on feedback received from the Karnataka State Food Commission following a survey of government schools that was meant to gauge the nutritional value of food served as part of the midday meals.

Among other observations, the panel noted the absence of onion and garlic in the midday meals served at some schools, and urged their inclusion to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

However, Akshaya Patra took objection as onion and garlic are identified as ""tamasic"" in Ayurveda and the Upanishads, which means food items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Akshaya Patra only believes in serving ""sattvic"" food cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients, a diet believed to have the opposite effect of its tamasic equivalent.

""The meal that Akshaya Patra gives has all the nutrients, micronutrients and oxidants that one needs,"" ISKCON spokesperson Naveen Neerada Dasa told The Print.

""We have conducted thorough research on this,"" he added. ""We have worked on it [the diet] scientifically. We are in collaboration with top nutrition laboratories, which agree that our food is wholesome.""

When ThePrint asked ISKCON about reports that they would back out of the deal with the state government, it was noncommittal.

The government letter sent to the NGO with the onion and garlic recommendation is yet to elicit a response.

ISKCON's Neerada Dasa confirmed to ThePrint that they had received the letter, and said they would be responding to it soon, ""after considering all their options"".

Speaking to the media, M.R. Maruthi, the joint director of Karnataka's midday meal scheme, said Akshaya Patra had violated the terms of their agreement by withholding the two items from meals, but added that their letter was just meant to convey a recommendation.

""A few questions were raised by the food commission as to why onion and garlic were not being used [in the meal],"" said Maruthi.

""Based on the commission's observations, we have written to all the [midday meal partner] organisations that do not use them in meals. This is a letter of recommendation, and not an order,"" he added.

The ISKCON representative said the government should ""understand our intent"".

""If there are any issues, we can sort them out. If there is feedback, we are ready to satisfy the state and the Centre's recommendations, but one should understand our intent,"" Dasa said.

""Do you know that we serve the world's biggest madrassa in Jaipur?"" he added. ""We have invested close to Rs 15 crore per kitchen. All this, because our only objective is to serve hot, nutritious food for all and we are committed to do so.""

Dieticians largely weigh in on Akshaya Patra's side, saying onion and garlic are additives that enhance taste.

As far as their nutritional value is concerned, there are nuts and fibres that can provide the same effect as onion and garlic, they add.

""There is no harm if you don't add onion and garlic [to your meals],"" said Hema Arvind, chief dietician at the M.S. Ramaiah Medical College and Hospital in Bengaluru.

""Garlic is supposed to be good for your cholesterol. There are other foods that can help in the same,"" he added. ""It is a particular nutrient in garlic that helps... the component can be found in other food items or vegetables.""

The Karnataka controversy is the second within months to hit Akshaya Patra, which, according to its website, helps provide midday meals to 17 lakh students in nearly 15,000 schools.

The foundation reached a truce with the Odisha government after a row over its refusal to serve students two eggs per week as part of the meal.

Under the agreement, the schools will procure the eggs, while Akshaya Patra will bear the costs.

The Lakhimpur district administration in association with the Lakhimpur Police barricaded four roads from different corners that led to the North Lakhimpur Govt HS School, the venue of counting of ballots. However, the police allowed people to cross the barricades restricting the entry of all types of vehicles only. The authorities also allowed kiosks selling eatables inside the barricaded areas of the roads during the counting days. As the counting continued for three days till December 14 morning, the large presence of people inside the barricaded areas caused unprecedented dirt and littering of garbage. People threw plastic bottles, disposable plastics, wrappers and various wastes in that area along with other wastes like food leftovers. Moreover, spitting and littering with tobacco products and betel nut chewing further made the places look very dirty. Most importantly, open air urinating and defecation by the crowds in that area made it stink for three days - leaving the local residents in utmost trouble and discomfort. The authorities did not make any arrangements for toilets in the areas close to the counting centre while allowing large crowds to gather. The mushrooming of eateries overnight in that areas too were allowed to add more wastes openly.

The public lane in front of the District Judicial Complex was soaked in human urine making the area stink and unhealthy. Despite the presence of large banners and hoardings displaying the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan of the Centre and that of the Assam government, outnumbering other campaign displays in and around the DC's office in North Lakhimpur, the Lakhimpur district administration made no arrangements to keep the area clean despite the experience of previous years of poll counting. The dirty condition of public places in front of the DC's office sadly reminds one of the poor state of the affairs of the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in Lakhimpur district in which all the official functions like Swachh Pakhwada, helicopter-flying VIPs brandishing brooms in schools and public roads have been mere photo opportunities.

The cleaning staff of North Lakhimpur Municipality Board swept and cleared some areas in front of the DC's office on the morning of December 14. However, other areas like the road in front of the Circuit House, the District Library and its nearby area remained full of garbage left over by panchayat poll enthusiasts and supporters of the candidates. The same scenario was also experienced in the last panchayat poll counting in 2013 in the same area. But the authorities here have learnt no lessons from that for which this time also there was dirt and squalor for three days. Further, the turning off of the streetlights installed on the boundaries of DC's office and the poor maintenance of other streetlights in that area gave ample scope for the crowd to dirty the area. It will take some more days to clear and clean all these areas from the poll-induced garbage in North Lakhimpur."

The cyclone moved further north-northwestwards at a speed of 16 kmph for the past six hours on today (December 16), according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

Based on current conditions, it has been predicted that there will be a landfall between Kakinada and Tuni by tomorrow evening due to the formation of a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal with winds moving at a speed of 70-80 kmph.

Heavy rainfall warning

Over the looming threat of a cyclone, rainfall predictions have hit the roof.

Rainfall is expected to take place at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places, very likely over coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh on December 16 and 17.

Extremely heavy rain (more than or equal to 20 cm) is expected at isolated places and is also likely over north coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh (East and West Godavari, Vishakhapatnam, Krishna, Guntur, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam districts) and Yanam district of Puducherry on December 17.

Isolated places, likely over adjoining districts of north Tamil Nadu, Odisha and Chhattisgarh are also expected to get heavy rainfall between December 16 and 17.

On the same day, strong wind speed going up to 50 kmph, is likely to prevail over northwest Bay of Bengal.

Sea conditions

The sea condition is high over the southwest and the adjoining West Central Bay of Bengal, and is likely to be high to very high from the evening of December 16 till the next day.

Storm surge warning

Storm surge at the height of about 0.5-1.0 metres above the astronomical tides is likely to inundate the low lying areas of coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam district of Puducherry, at the time of the landfall.

Damage expected over coastal Andhra Pradesh:

Thatched huts, power and communication lines are under threat of being damaged due to branches breaking.

Small trees may be uprooted altogether and crops like paddy, banana, papaya trees and orchards might also get damaged due to the cyclone. Sea water inundation is expected to happen in low lying areas after erosion of Kutcha embankments.

In light of the imminent Cyclone and the prediction of danger that engulfs the areas it might hit, fishing has been suspended.

Those who are out in deep sea areas have been advised to return to the coasts.

Railways on alert

South Central Railway has made elaborate arrangements to handle emergency situations and keep officers and its staff ready to undertake any relief work.

Extensive patrolling along railway tracks is being undertaken to ensure trains move safely and regulate any services in cases of emergency.

All station masters along the coastal belt of Andhra Pradesh have been advised to maintain close contact with state authorities and higher Railway officials for proper co-ordination. They will also reach out to passengers in case they require food and other requirements.

The application process for admissions to entry-level classes in over 1,600 private schools began Saturday. The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised the parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further order to avoid any inconvenience to them in case any penal action is initiated against defaulter schools.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official said. ""If it is found that the said schools are taking admission despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added. The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. Delhi Govt Introduces 100 More Libraries in Its Schools; Students to Be the Bookkeeper.

According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7. The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4. The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections/disadvantaged groups. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions. The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1.

The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system."
