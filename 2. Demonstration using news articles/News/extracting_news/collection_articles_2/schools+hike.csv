Currently, school managements require only PTA'S approval to hike fees, but this is often seen to be a mere formality. The amendment proposes that schools get 76% of the parents to sign off on the plan. Previou-sly, the state had proposed that parents would be able to approach the divisional fee review committee against a hike if they have the backing of 25% of the total parent strength. But the move was perceived to be impractical, given the difficulties involved in mobilizing support among parents in such large numbers. Putting the onus on the school to seek parents' approval may act as a better safeguard against profiteering.

Maharashtra, unlike states like Tamil Nadu, doesn't have a committee which fixes fees for schools. The fee review committees at the district level only hear complaints from schools and parents if the difference in the proposed and acceptable fees is over 15%.

But a former member of a school's PTA executive body said the 76% rule is likely to work against parents. ""The PTA committee is elected by parents and designated with the responsibility to understand the calculations behind a proposed hike. But when we fight fee hikes, we find support in only a handful of parents,"" said the parent.

The 11-page amendment has also proposed that schools be allowed to charge an interest in case of non-payment of fees. While the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, has no mention of charging late fee or fine in case of non-payment, schools were expected to follow the old rule, which allowed them to charge Re 1 per day.

""Schools can collect fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. If a parent wants to pay for six months or annually, they must be allowed to do so and a discount could be given for the same,"" stated the draft. But if a parent does not pay fees in time, the school would be authorized to charge an interest on the late fee. The interest will be decided by the state.

The draft also proposed reducing the number of posts held by parents by one. Parents rued that all amendments favoured school managements. ""Our representation is being reduced, interest has been introduced and fine amount for schools has been reduced,"" said a parent. School education minister Vinod Tawde did not respond to TOI's queries on the draft."

Ramesh Rana, president of Haryana Parents' Forum For Education, said, ""All schools raise fees every session by 10-12%. They don't ask parents what the hike should be. They raise school fees at will in the name of rising costs.""

In the second poll, 87% parents said their respective state governments have not taken any action in years to regulate the yearly hikes, while only 13% said otherwise.

Dev Kumar, president of DPSG Parents' Association, said, ""Had the Haryana government acted against the schools, who are always looking to hike the fee, the disparity wouldn't have been so much. There are schools in the city which are run by MPs, MLAs and corporates. This is an education mafia and the state government easily accepts whatever they say.""

When parents were asked about the root cause of these hikes, around 61% said it was due to a lack of regulation by the state, while 14% said it was due to a lack of enforcement by district officers. Many of them also cited lack of funds as the possible reason.

Sameer Nasa, whose kid studies in Blue Bells School, said, ""The state is not willing to regulate school fees because the entire system has become greedy. Schools are increasing the fee citing the Seventh Pay Commission, which is wrong.""

The survey further revealed that 72% parents are of the opinion that fee hike should be based on a model that ties it to the rate of inflation, while 22% said there should be a 10% cap on hikes.

Bhupinder Singh, whose kid study in Narayana e Techno School, Sector 37, said, ""There should be a capon school fee hikes by the authorities. Why should the school alone get to decide this? It shouldn't be raised beyond 3-5% annually.""

On the other hand, schools said the annual hikes are justified. Vaibhav Kapoor, principal of Ajanta Public School, Sector 31, said, ""Every year, we have to increase the teacher's salary. Invariably, we have to do it by increasing the school fee. It's also based on improvements in infrastructure.""

Deepika Sharma, principal of DPSG, Palam Vihar, said, ""The fee hike in our school this year is less than 10%. We do it every year to keep up with maintenance and other costs. There are 15 teacher workshops which are held 'round the year, for which NCERT charges us a lot."""

For the last few days he has been under immense pressure, not over his work, but over his daughter's education. He had received intimation that the fee was to be hiked substantially for the upcoming year and since then, he has been wondering what he can do to ensure that he can pay his child's school fee. Ravi is one of many parents in the city who are feeling the heat, not because of the summer but rather because private schools in the city have hiked their fees. The surge in school fees ranges from Rs 6,000 to over '30,000 per annum in some cases. Schools are tight-lipped about why the fee is being increased so drastically.

""My daughter's school fee has been increased from '1.1 lakh to about '1.4 lakh,"" said M Ashwin*, a parent of a class 7 student at a private school in South Chennai. ""They have not given us any reason for the increase but if at all someone asks, they say it is because they are building a sports arena. This sports arena has not been completed so long. In the process, the children have not been playing for the last one year. It is ridiculous.""Further, parents said they hesitated to question the fee hike as they thought their children might then be subjected to ill-treatment by the staff and teachers in schools.

While some parents allege that the Goods and Services Tax has led to the surge in fees, schools dismiss this claim and called the hike a 'routine' one. ""The fee hike is done every year in accordance with the guidelines set by the Fee Determination Committee,"" said Principal of a well-known private school on the condition of anonymity. ""The hike has little to do with the Goods and Services Tax. I don't see schools using that as a reason to increase the fees.""

She added that the fee structure is set by the Tamil Nadu Private Schools Fee Determination Committee and hence schools cannot violate what the committee lays down as the rate of increase for the stipulated period. ""Every three years every school has to approach the committee and based on the expenditure of the school and facilities, the committee sets a limit by which the school can hike the fees every year,"" she explained. ""Generally it is not more than 10% but it differs from school to school and board to board.""Last year, the fee committee under Justice TV Masilamani met for the first time in April and had reportedly discussed various issues like the logistics needed for the fee fixation process and enhancing the staff strength for the huge task.

The committee had said it would provide every school with the chance to present their facts and records before fixing the fee. It has the power to determine the fee to be collected by private schools and hear complaints with regards to collection of the fee in excess of the fee determined by it. However, when Express approached the committee to find out if schools were following the diktat issued by them, they said that there were schools which were flouting the rules. ""There are some schools that are charging amounts that are above the prescribed limit,"" said an official of the committee on the condition of anonymity.

""There are schools which are supposed to charge '9,000 as the fees but they charge '18,000 in the name of some trust or other facilities. They do this without the knowledge of the committee and if parents feel that the school is charging an exorbitant fee that is not justified or in line with the guidelines of the committee, they can approach the committee and complain. The committee will definitely look into it and take action.""

The official added that schools should not force parents to pay the entire amount in one go. He said it is mandatory for the fee to be split over three terms and for parents to be given the option of paying it before every term. He did, however, say that if a parent voluntarily wants to pay the fee at one time, that is permissible. Those from lesser privileged backgrounds are feeling the pinch more than anyone else. Many of them put a lot on the line just to ensure their children can go to a reputed private school and receive good education. The hope is that their children will not have to lead the lives that they did. However, with such a spike in fees, it makes it very hard for parents to keep their children in such schools.

""I am getting very worried now,"" said Rahul Kumar*, who works as a driver for a family and is sending his son to a private school in the suburbs for education. ""The school has not intimated us about a hike as yet but I heard from many people that the fee is being hiked steeply this year; so I am very uneasy. I wanted my son to get a good education; but, if it continues like this, I will have to send him back to my village to study because the city schools are too expensive.""For parents whose children are graduating from Montessori school to LKG too, the fee figure is a looming nightmare.

The astronomical rise in fees has left parents in a financial soup. But, what is shocking is, unbeknown to parents, the new fee has been decided in 'consultation' with them.

As per the Act, the fee is decided in every school by a 10-member school fee committee which includes five parents, three teachers and two representatives from the school administration.

The committee proposes the hike after considering the expenses, facilities, teachers' qualification, etc. Sources said that the state expected to restrict the yearly rise between 5% and 8%.

But most of the schools have raised the fees above the maximum, with BVB Vidhyashram increasing it by a whopping 27%.

The annual fees for classes I to 5 jumped from Rs 68,000 in 2017-18 to Rs 84,000 in 2018-19. TOI repeatedly called up the school to speak to the principal but received no response.

Parents said that they feel cheated about the hike approved by the school-level fee committee for the new academic session.

The Act says that every school has to form a Parent -Teacher Association (PTA), with five if its members picked through lottery for the fee committee.

The names of members in the committee have to be displayed on the notice board within a period 15 days from the formation of the committee.

But when TOI spoke to parents of students studying in various schools, they expressed ignorance about the formation of any such committee.

Anubha Goyal, a mother of two children studying in classes 4 and 9 at BVB Vidhyashram, was not aware about the role of parents in deciding the fees. ""The hike is not justifiable. The facilities they provide to our children are very minimal. The furniture is broken and tears the uniform. Even big classrooms have only two fans which make it unbearable for our children. I have complained many times to the authority, but no action has been taken,"" she said.

According to the Act, the PTA has to meet before August 15 and the school-level fee committee has to meet once every three months. None of the parents that TOI contacted have been invited for the general meeting or informed about the fee committee.

What is more surprising is that many schools have not formed the committee due to objections while others due to ignorance. Sarita Katiyar, principal of Ryan International School, Mansarovar, said the school has not formed the fee committee. ""I am not aware of constituting any committee for fee fixing,"" said Katiyar. TOI repeatedly called Lata Rawat, the principal of Cambridge Court High School, to enquire about fee hike but received no response.

With tension mounting between parents and schools over the issue, sparks are set to fly at the start of the next academic session."

Though disappointed, they are preparing to challenge the court stay legally in the coming days. Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA), that has been fighting the indiscriminate hike in fees by schools, claims it had anticipated the stay. ""We knew the school managements would try to stay the government order and hence wanted the government to file a caveat in the court. However, the government's unwillingness resulted in the stay,"" say association members. Not being a party in the case, the HSPA could not file a caveat on its own.

""HSPA had also contacted the Government Pleader for the Education Department to inform HSPA on the filing of any case by any school or school association so that HSPA could effectively intervene in the issue. Neither was a caveat filed nor were we informed for reasons best known to the government,"" said Seema Agarwal of HSPA.

""Had the government impressed upon the court that the issue has been pending since 2009, and that between 2009 and 2018 school fees have increased by a massive 500 per cent, the court would not have, perhaps, passed the interim order,"" fume parents. ""The government also has at its disposal all the proofs of extreme profiteering by schools, including those submitted by HSPA. However, these too it seems, have not been brought to the notice of HC,"" alleged Seema.

A statement issued by HSPA has questioned the government's intention in the matter. ""The actions or the lack of it seem to suggest that the government finds the schools more powerful than itself. That is why it is acquiescing meekly before the schools allowing them to ride roughshod over all its orders,"" it read.

Meanwhile, most parents feel the respite they got from the freezing of fee hike is now over and they now have to revise their budgets to accommodate additional expenditure. ""It is only a matter of days when the schools will send circulars detailing their new and hiked fee structure. Several schools had already sent the new fee structure but had to grudgingly withdraw it due to the government directive,"" said Rachana Sharma, a parent.

What next?

""We will be fighting this order in the courts for sure. The best way to move ahead legally is either by impleading in the present case or by the filing of a separate Writ Appeal against this judgment. We will decide our course of action after consultation with our legal team,"" said Ashish Naredi, a member.

SHRC seeks report on school's refusal to let student in

Hyderabad: The State Human Rights Commission sought a report from the Rangareddy district education officer on a complained received from a parent his daughter was not allowed by her school to attend classes. G Narasimha Chary said in his complaint that his daughter, studying at class 7 in St Adams High School, was not allowed inside along with other students. Meanwhile, a small portion of the gate fell off. The principal warned and asked them to go back to their homes. Despite repeated requests by the parents, the principal refused to allow the girl to attend classes and threatened to issue transfer certificate."
