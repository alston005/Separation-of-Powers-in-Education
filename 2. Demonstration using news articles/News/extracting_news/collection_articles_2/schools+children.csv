Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has helped set up two boarding schools for children of martyrs and disabled in action.IANS

Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat has said the plan to set up two boarding schools for children of martyrs and disabled soldiers has been given in-principle approval by the government.

The Army chief said that the two schools would be based on the lines of Delhi's Sanskriti school. As per reports, the two schools will be in Pathankot and Bhopal or Secunderabad.

According to Rawat, the initiative had to be taken as the government had earlier capped Rs 10,000 per month for education assistance to the children of martyrs and disabled in action.

Rawat believes that once the schools are operational, then the government can withdraw the education assistance scheme.

However, Rawat believes that since many people were misusing the scheme, the government had to ultimately put a cap on the educational assistance scheme.

""Somehow, some people among us started misusing the scheme. We told the government that we will review the policy so that only genuine people can benefit from it,"" the Army Chief told PTI.

It is reported that for the schools to be fully operational, it might take more than three to four years.

Once the students finish studying from these schools, they can eventually enroll in army-run colleges.

The Army chief further added that the Indian Army would take care of the financial assistance of these children if the government does not help them with the funds for education.

The assistance education scheme that started in 1972 was established to waive off the tuition fees of the children of martyrs or disabled in action. This was implemented in all schools, colleges and other educational institutes across the nation.

However, in July 2017, the government ordered the capping of this scheme to Rs 10,000 per month, which was not well received with the armed force services.

A written request was sent to the defence ministry by the Chief of Committee Staff to remove the cap. However, the government later refused to modify the cap.

When the decision was taken by the government, nearly 3,400 children from the armed forces were impacted."

India army: Army's plan to set up two boarding schools for children of martyrs and those disabled in action has been given in-principle approval by the government, informed Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat. The reason behind the decision is that as the government caps at Rs 10,000 per month the educational assistance it gives to these children, the initiative has to be taken. He said the government put a cap on the educational assistance as some people were misusing the scheme.

The Army Chief said after the schools become operational, the government may be conveyed that it can withdraw the educational assistance scheme. The schools may become operational after 3-4 years. Gen. Rawat said the two educational institutions will be developed on the lines of Delhi's Sanskriti school. One school will be built in Pathankot and the other will come up either in Bhopal or Secunderabad.

If the government does not provide them funds, the army will till then take care of the financial need of children of martyrs or those disabled in action, he added. After completing their graduation from the two boarding schools, the students can study in the Army-run colleges.

""Somehow, some people among us started misusing the scheme. We told the government that we will review the policy so that only genuine people can benefit from it,"" he said. Under the scheme, rolled out in 1972, tuition fee of children of martyrs or those disabled in action were completely waived in schools, colleges and other professional educational institutions.

On July 1, the government had issued an order capping the amount at Rs 10,000 per month, triggering discontentment among all the three services. The Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC) had written to the defence ministry requesting it to remove the cap. But the government has refused to review the decision.
