The class 10 student went missing from his home in Cherthala on September 23. At 4.30 am this morning, the Cherthala police arrived at the Chennai Park lodge in Choolaimedu. On enquiring at the reception, they found that the teacher and the student had been at the hotel for the last four days.

""Two complaints were filed in Alappuzha, one each at Muhamma and Cherthala police stations. At Muhamma police station, the complaint was filed by the child's parents because he was missing. At Cherthala, the teachers' parents filed a missing complaint,"" says Cherthala SI Ajith Kumar. ""In a joint investigation the police traced them to Chennai, early morning on Friday,"" he added.

According to police sources, initial searches for the teacher and the victim was conducted in Kanyakumari, Ooty and Madurai. This after eyewitnesses saw the teacher and student at the Cherthala railway station.

According to the boy's father, the teacher took the minor under the pretext of going to the bus stop for 10 minutes.

""He said he'll go till the bus stop and come back. The teacher took him saying she'll send him back in 10 minutes. But he never came back. After half an hour, when we called the teacher she said he is near the house and that he will reach in 5 minutes. When we called again after sometime, her phone was switched off,"" the father had told the media.

The child and the teacher were brought to the Muhamma police station and a case was filed against the teacher under section 363 of the IPC for kidnapping and section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act.

The police officers investigating the case have sent a report to the Child Welfare Committee.

Childline authorities from the district told TNM that they will be meeting the boy on Saturday and further investigations will take place. ""A sitting with the CWC officials will happen on Thursday (Oct 4) and following this counselling, medical tests will be carried out as per the protocol,"" officials at Childline Alappuzha told TNM.

According to an investigating officer, the teacher said that the teenager was unable to live in his house anymore, and so she decided to take him with her. The police however say that according to preliminary investigation, the child had a healthy relationship with his parents, but there had been friction regarding the role of the teacher.

The child was presented before Juvenile Justice Board and has sent away him with his parents, Muhamma Police Sub Inspector M Ajaya Mohan said."

A teacher was arrested while she was teaching a class full of students and the local police were stopped from arresting two others by the local MLA in Gandevi taluka of Gujarat's Navsari district on Monday after the mamlatdar (chief officer of the taluka) issued a warrant for the trio's arrest for missing electoral roll revision work assigned to them.

The roll revision drive is taken up by the Election Commission of India for next year's General Election, and Gandevi taluka's mamlatdar S D Chaudhary asked the police on Monday to pick up the three teachers and present them at his office on Tuesday.

Government school teachers have been appointed booth-level officers (BLOs) in the electoral roll revision drive, and Navsari district administration had asked all BLOs on Sunday to verify and correct them. Three BLOs -- all teachers at village primary schools -- had failed to turn up when the exercise was carried out in Gandevi on Monday: Manisha Raman Patel of Undach village primary school, Nidhi Bharat Patel (Antaliya), and Geeta Arun Patel (Gadat).

Calling it a ""humiliation by the mamlatdar"", Geeta Patel, 50, said, ""I am teaching for the last 20 years at Undach village. I was given election work at Salej village, which is far. I had earlier requested the mamlatdar to give election-related work in Undach. We are not against work but one should think before assigning such responsibility. We are upset that they sent a police team to our workplace to arrest us.""

On Tuesday, Gujarat chief electoral officer S Murali Krishna said, ""The officials are not supposed to take such action. There were no directions from this office (Chief Election Office), neither was this office informed about this (arrest warrant). I have instructed the district officers concerned to ensure such incidents are not repeated.""

Defending his action, mamlatdar S D Chaudhary said, ""These three teachers failed in doing their duty, so we issued arrest warrants and instructed police to take action.""

The police, he said, ""brought them and they gave us in writing that they will do election-related work"" in future.

Nidhi Patel, 32, was arrested while she was teaching students of class VII, leaving the children shell-shocked, according to those present. Nidhi was taken to the mamlatdar office, where she had to give written assurance that she will finish her election-related work before October 15.

The two other teachers, Manisha Patel, 45, and Geeta Patel, 50, were at a science fair in Vadsarang village of the district. When the police reached there to arrest them, two BJP MLAs present at the venue -- Naresh Patel (of Gandevi constituency) and Piyush Patel (Navsari) stopped them from arresting the duo. They told the police team that the teachers would go to the mamlatdar office on Monday evening, once the science fair wound up.

Both went to the mamlatdar office in the evening and gave a written undertaking that they would do all election-related work assigned to them.

Navsari District Teachers' Association president Dilip Patel, who reached the office to support the teachers, said, ""Arrest warrants are not proper; they create a poor impression of teachers on students' minds.... Why are only teachers selected for election and other work? There are other officials in different government department who can do the same work.""

Calling it a situation of ""pressure created by the mamlatdar"" that forced the police to act ""immediately"", Navsari's Deputy Superintendent of Police S G Rana said, ""Our staff were given the arrest warrant by the mamlatdar and they acted on it. The police did their duty; they have not done anything illegal. (But) I think the police team should have waited until the school hours got over before arresting teacher Nidhi Patel.""

Naresh Patel, MLA from Gandevi and Navsari district BJP president, said, ""I stopped the police from taking action against Geeta Patel. She was busy with students, showing the science project. I spoke with the mamlatdar and the (district) collector. The police action is not good -- they came to arrest a teacher in the presence of students and other dignitaries.""

In yet another case of corporal punishment in a private school, a teacher allegedly beat a 10-year-old boy with a stick on Thursday for skipping remedial classes the previous day. The class five student has a hearing impairment and was badly bruised, said his parents.

The boy's mother, along with other parents, staged a protest at the A. U. Nursery, Primary and High School in Guttahalli demanding action against Kannada teacher Pooja Narasaiah.

Earlier this week, a teacher of Evershine English School near Srinagar had slapped a student for not completing his homework. The teacher was suspended.

The latest incident came to light when the child's father arrived at the school mid-morning with his lunch-box. According to the parents, the boy came out of the class and narrated the incident to his father.

The boy had been selected for remedial classes after his teachers deemed him academically weak. However, he and another student did not attend the class and also failed to inform the teacher.

The mother of the student said, ""If my son is missing classes or not doing the work assigned to him, the school must inform us. How can they beat our son? We demand action against the teacher.""

Tanseer Ahmed Jaffer, secretary of the school, acknowledged that the teacher had beaten the boy but described it as a 'small' issue, which was resolved. ""The school management has sought a written apology from the teacher, Pooja Narasaiah,"" he said, adding that a warning has been given to the teacher. ""Other teachers, too, have been warned that such instances [of corporal punishment] should not take place. The boy's father also beat up the child, which aggravated the injury.""

The child's mother has denied the allegation the father, too, had raised his hand on the student.

Explanation sought

G.K. Puttaraju, Block Education Officer, North Range 2 said that a show cause notice will be issued to the school seeking an explanation.

The school, which follows the State syllabus, was established in 1979 and has a student strength of 260 from nursery to class ten.
