State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

By the time the West Bengal state information commission heard his complaint, in March 2018, his hair had turned silver. ""It was pointless. I had no use of the information after 10 years,'' says the 65-year-old bank employee turned RTI activist.

Choudhury's frustration is shared by many people across the country, as the landmark RTI act completes 14 years. RTI activist Venkatesh Nayak had sought details of how the decision to demonetise currency took place. He applied for information in December 2016, a month after the announcement. Not only has the information not been given, but two years on, he is yet to get a hearing on his case.

The RTI act, which came into effect in 2005, was meant to herald a new era of transparency and accountability in public administration. Though there have been some significant changes, RTI activists and practitioners of the law feel that its implementation has been hobbled by an apathetic government. Amendments to the law are now being considered, but meanwhile, what ails the RTI act?

Pending applications

The number of appeals and complaints pending before the Central Information Commission stands at 26,037. The Maharashtra information commission has 40,000 cases pending before it. In court documents submitted by civic group Satark Nagrik Sangathan (SNS), Karnataka has 33,000 cases pending before it. The number of information commissioners expected to hear these cases has drastically reduced. A March 2018 SNS study found that it would take 43 years for cases to be disposed of in West Bengal as of November 1, 2017 with 8,000 cases pending. SNS coordinator Anjali Bharadwaj says, ""The waiting period in the CIC was 10 months when there were 23,500 cases pending, but now with only three commissioners and the number of pending appeals increasing to 26,037, the waiting period is well over a year."" Kerala has a waiting period of over six years while an appeal in Odisha can take over 5 years to be heard. The wait time for Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Himachal and Karnataka is over a year. While frivolous applications are a part of this, studies find that they are only a fraction of the approximately 9.17 lakh RTI applications filed in 2016-2017.

Bureaucratic gatekeeping

Activists feel that the attitude of the information commissioners, who are usually civil servants, tends to be conservative. Of the 303 commissioners for whom background information was available, 59% were retired government officials, while 14% had a legal or judicial background. Only 8% commissioners had a background in journalism, 6% were educationists and 3% were social activists or workers.

The timidity of this tribe is set to worsen, as the Central government has recently moved amendments that give the government the authority to decide the tenure and salaries of the commissioners. As of now, the ICs have a fixed term of five years and rank of Election Commissioners. ""The new amendments will end the independence of the CIC,"" says senior Supreme Court lawyer Prasant Bhushan. Former chief information commissioner Wajahat Habibullah agrees that this would be a hit on the autonomy of the commission.

Lack of transparency:

One of the key stipulations of the RTI act was that public authorities would voluntarily disclose and update information to the public through websites and boards. But an audit found that out of the 2092 authorities, only 40% responded with information on the work of the department. Of the 838 who did respond, 85% did not give information related to budget and program, or publicity, public interface and e-governance.

Government vs government:

A former information commissioner at the CIC, Sridhar Acharyulu, has raised serious questions on the way the government has mounted an attack on itself. An estimated 1,700 writ petitions have been filed by the Centre against orders passed by information commissioners under RTI. Surprisingly, in many of these petitions, the public authorities like the government itself and regulators like Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have impleaded information commissioners for acting under the RTI Act. He says, ""If a commissioner's order is challenged in court of law, it has an intimidating effect on the information commissioner. Information is delayed while two government departments continue to fight each other.""

The way ahead

These practical difficulties are cold comfort for Pushpa (who goes by one name), a resident of Begumpura basti near Delhi Malviya Nagar. ''We had no water to drink, and there would be fights every morning at the communal tap. People would get violent, police would be called and our MLA was busy building fountains in the neighbourhood park. This got us very angry,'' she says. The slum, which had 400-500 people, filed a RTI for details on MLA development funds. What she got for her pains was just threats and advice. ''When I went to the municipal office, I was told that I should stop filing applications and concentrate on watching Aastha channel,'' she says.

Pushpa was undeterred, and with the help from the SNS, filed a complaint with the CIC who in 2011 ordered that information boards be put up at all public sites. That went on for a while, but soon the compliance ended. No one is paying attention anymore, says Pushpa."

A powerful public speech or good oratory has the power to rouse the downtrodden, move nations to war or shape mass opinion. Speeches have an epochal quality about them, capable of defining the age and creating verbal markers to punctuate history's unremitting march. By that token, the October speech by Viral Acharya, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) deputy governor, perhaps deserves to go down in history as 2018's definitive talk.

It deserves special mention because it brought to public attention arcane issues like central banking and monetary policy, apart from highlighting the fast deteriorating relationship between the RBI and government. Though the hyphen separating the two is suffused with tension, cooperation between them is critical for the smooth functioning of the economy. Acharya's speech set off alarm bells that were heard not only in bond and currency dealing rooms but also resounded in cocktail parties and drawing room chatter. Unwittingly, his speech also joined multiple global dots, echoing similar conflicts between central banks and elected governments in the US, Argentina, Turkey, and elsewhere. The speech became an integral component of a classic tragi-comedy: a slow but visible build-up of tension, the threat of a bruising denouement, an anti-climactic rapprochement and eventually the resignation of governor Urjit Patel who was promptly replaced with career bureaucrat Shaktikanta Das.

So why did Acharya vent in public? One version is that he did what all governors have always done in the past: used public platforms for communicating a central bank's concerns. Communication has become a critical implement in any central banker's toolkit; it speaks to the public, to power and communicates a nuanced message to markets. The other interpretation is that Patel's infrequent public appearances may have forced Acharya to come to the institution's defence and reassert the importance of central banking autonomy. ""There are several reasons why enshrining and maintaining central bank independence ends up being an inclusive reform for the economy and, conversely, undermining such independence a regressive, extractive one...""

Some saw it as a desperate, rearguard action by a central bank with its back to the wall. It also sent out signals that the governor was alone, with the bureaucracy having abandoned its support. This became increasingly evident as the government started making veiled threats through carefully orchestrated media leaks. This is how Acharya ended his speech: ""As many parts of the world today await greater government respect for central bank independence, independent central bankers will remain undeterred. Governments that do not respect central bank independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fire, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution. Their wiser counterparts who invest in central bank independence will enjoy lower costs of borrowing, the love of international investors, and longer life spans.""

There are many explanations for the likely compulsions that drove Acharya to craft and deliver a speech that got hackles up in Delhi, provided ample ammunition to conspiracy junkies and sent a shiver down the spine of markets. The slow-burn conflict between North Block, which houses the finance ministry, and Mint Street showed signs of rapidly descending into a full-blown bushfire after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's misadventure with demonetization. It didn't help when the newly appointed Patel, unusually reticent for a modern-day governor (especially when compared with immediate predecessor Raghuram Rajan), chose to soldier on silently. This created the impression, perhaps misplaced, that he was party to the unilateral decision. Yet, his subsequent actions, markedly punitive for loan defaulters and lazy bankers, seemed to belie the popular impression of a conformist.

The government and the RBI have often locked horns in the past, under different governments, when finance ministers used proxy methods -- such as appointing their men as deputy governors, denying renewal of term to career central bankers when regulatory strictures hurt crony capitalists or by creating parallel power structures -- to clip the central bank's wings. However, things never got out of hand. Various sane voices in the bureaucracy used back channels as a counterpoint to the rhetoric in public.

Acharya's outburst, measured against the speeches by past RBI governors, might seem incendiary. Many past governors have used the public platform to convey a key policy decision or signal a sharp policy departure. However, none was as controversial as Acharya's. When mapped against all the speeches of 2018, it stands out for launching a thousand opinions about central banks' operational autonomy and for galvanizing heated public debate whether the government was overreaching or the RBI needed to add accountability to its charter. In that sense, it is perhaps among the most discussed and dissected speech in recent times.

A close second would have to be Congress president Rahul Gandhi's speech during the no-confidence motion debate in Parliament in June. This address, though unremarkable in its prose or oratory, marked Gandhi's coming of age. Before the speech, there was this unsure man, struggling to gain his political chops in the face of Modi's folksy but powerful oratory. After the speech, there was a new-found swagger and a visible ability to husband votes and seats in the electoral sweepstakes.

On a global scale, in terms of its influence over events, it would perhaps have to be the last sentence from Frances McDormand's acceptance speech at this year's Oscars: ""I have two words to leave with you tonight, ladies and gentlemen: 'inclusion rider'."" It set off a flurry of questions on all manner of search engines but also impelled the entertainment industry to examine gender discrimination in its employment processes.

Speeches can be of various kinds and tailored for various purposes. Some have a limited impact, some leave their imprint on humankind's collective memory. Speeches existed even before technology had a way of propagating them and influencing mass consciousness.

It might be instructive to view speech-making (or, at a stretch, demagoguery) and democracy as somewhat joined at the hip. The first stirrings were perhaps felt with the beginning of declamations in the agoras of Athens when monarchy and attendant tyranny gradually gave way to the rudimentary forms of democracy. The popularity of rhetoric in public life of Athens and Plato's development of dialectic reasoning stand out among the first recorded instances of public speaking. Even earlier, Plato's teacher and philosopher Socrates' self defence in public against charges of impiety and corruption of youth are soul-stirring: ""Virtue springs not from possessions, but from virtue springs possessions and all other human blessings, whether for the individual or for society."" Plato's student Aristotle even subsequently taught pubic speaking as it was believed to be an integral component of one's education. The Grecian tradition threw up some very engaging and inspiring public speakers, Pericles and Demosthenes chief among them.

Many fictional speeches are so high up in the inspirational scale that they are now bestowed with a semblance of reality. A good example is perhaps Mark Anthony's lend-me-your-ears speech from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. The only record of the Mount of Sinai sermon delivered by Moses on God's behalf (""I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage"") exists in Deuteronomy 5 of the Old Testament.

The arrival of the printing press and its ability to leverage the power of the word remained circumscribed because literacy was restricted to the ruling classes. It was essentially aristocrats speaking to aristocrats. Yet, speech as a document could now be archived and studied, circulated and debated. Speeches became tools to question and challenge. Oliver Cromwell or Mirabeau used speeches as to implant the first seeds of democracy in feudal Britain and France, respectively.

As literacy grew, so too did new voices and their ability to spread radical ideas. Vladimir I. Lenin used speech and pamphleteering to great effect, whether to organize workers and soldiers or install a political system that, as a compelling idea, became the default option for half of our planet. ""Only the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poor peasants is capable of smashing the resistance of the capitalists, of displaying truly supreme courage and determination in the exercise of power...""

On the other side of the world, M.K. Gandhi was using speech and articles to seek support for a new moral framework that would become India's mainstay in its struggle for freedom: ""Non-violence is the first article of my faith. It is the last article of my faith."" A citizenry ruled by foreign conquerors for almost a millennia was sufficiently inspired by Gandhi's methods to seek nationhood without taking up arms. Eventually, though, bloodshed could not be avoided. On the opposite side of the scale, British conservatives are still moved by Winston Churchill's exhortations to war. On the inspirational scale, though, nothing can beat Martin Luther King's ""I have a dream"" speech of 1963, which persuaded Guardian newspaper to even declare it the century's greatest speech.

In the Indian context, speeches made their appearance largely during the Independence struggle. It would, thus, seem that speech-making was not innately Indian. One possible reason could be that the prolonged yoke of foreign rule over the land had stifled education and free thought. The other possibility is that the epics perhaps motivated a differentiated communication mode for Indians, a dialogic engagement. The Bhagvad Gita is a prime example of how discourses, or samvaad, have influenced Indian thought and culture. Even Bhishma's dying declamation was actually a dialogue, mainly a response to questions from his nephew.

If one had to trace the origins of speech-making in the modern day, it might be fair to credit Swami Vivekananda's 1893 address to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago. Thereafter, the Independence movement saw a steady procession of impassioned speakers -- Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhash Chandra Bose, Vallabhbhai Patel, B.R. Ambedkar, and Bal Gangadhar Tilak -- which perhaps laid the foundation for the Constituent Assembly debates and the ensuing Constitution of India. Today, Modi uses the radio to reach out and communicate his thoughts to fellow Indians. Technology and lifestyle changes have affected speeches materially. Television beams out speeches in real time, university commencement speeches by iconic chief executive officers get circulated via email unceasingly. Social media is changing the contours of engagement: US President Donald Trump uses 288 characters to deliver a daily homily to his followers.

Even RBI, the oldest regulator in the country, is adapting to social media and touch-telephony, though the delivery mode of its speeches remain rooted in convention. If, instead of publicly voicing his disquiet, Acharya were to adopt social media as his communication tool, RBI's relationship status might have simply read ""Complicated""!"

As we approach another general election and look back, perhaps the biggest contribution, and disappointment, was the introduction of vikasvaad into our lexicon, and its incomplete articulation and poor implementation. It is also the frittering away of a historic opportunity to correct the structural problems which pin us down. The question remains: What is vikasvaad and why do we need it?

India is a land of great diversity and inequality. Add to this a massive vikas deficit, that is, the poor provisioning of sadak, bijli, paani and health, a large informal sector, struggling enterprises and a poverty of good jobs. All this was true at the birth of independent India and continues today. What is worse, we have lost our environment and a way of life more aligned with nature and the seasons. Yet, let alone modernity, even a modicum of certainty and dignity eludes us.

At Independence, in spite of the massive mobilisation of people, there were but a few imaginations of how India should be governed. The primary concerns then were, how will we stay together and what will pull our people out of abject poverty. The three broad options were: First, Ram Rajya. That is the politico-cultural stewardship of a popular and benevolent despot; second, a variation of Mahatma Gandhi's decentralised Hind Swaraj; and, finally, Nehruvian modernity, a paradigm of elite stewardship, which won the day and the approval of Gandhi.

Elite-vaad was the shoe-horning into existing colonial frameworks, a highly centralised and institutional meritocracy led by elite ""national"" bureaucrats and scientists. It was a concentration of knowledge and power, insulated from provincial politics, and a belief that this would rapidly take India and its people to a secular modernity. It is this vision that gave us the elite IAS, institutions like the IITs, CSIR laboratories, UGC, centralised regulatory and funding agencies. The motto was scientific temper -- unfortunately, a false binary between an apolitical and elite-supervised laboratory science and residual regressive practices of the ancients. This theme continues to this day as centrally employed scientists march to protect science from a backward people, but not to analyse their hardships.

Advertising

Predictably, the Nehruvian model has failed the common vernacular people, that is, Bharat. They remain poor, lumpen and jobless. Some states, especially from the South, tuned out of this imagination of the nation, instead preferring social comprehension and vernacular mobilisation, and they have generally done better. However, the model did lead to the flowering of English-speaking India as a successful satellite of the branded global economy and its business models. India is served by an army of delivery boys, janitors, watchmen, waiters, drivers, maids and cashiers from migrant Bharat. It may live in gated townships but the environmental collapse in Bharat is catching up. And yet, the hold of India over Bharat is almost complete. India eats what Bharat produces, drinks its water, extracts rents for most services, destroys its language, defines curricula and holds competitive exams, coaches its students, controls the media and decides what Bharat consumes and aspires for, materially and intellectually. Indian science refuses to measure and document the lived reality of the people of Bharat, of the long treks to fetch firewood, the empty wells and broken public transport. This consolidates the hold of the bureaucracy and shraddha over the destiny of the people of Bharat.

While politicians at the Centre may weigh in on defence, the railways and GST, it is in the provinces that the Nehruvian model tilts the balance of power in favour of the elite bureaucracy. In states with poor social awareness, this has led to cultural and developmental stagnation.

One would think that as social awareness improves, allegiance to the Nehruvian model would reduce. This is indeed happening in several states. However, a curious alignment of events and ideas has led to a revival of elite stewardship, and Indian intellectuals have played an important role. The first was the release of the Mandal report, which reopened a horizontal division of the people of Bharat along caste lines. This was reinforced through many centrally-sponsored rights-based schemes and a jargon of the disadvantaged and the oppressed, and, a delivery through key NGOs and people of good intentions, bypassing so-called local vested interests. Next was the emergence of big science and a theory of cosmopolitan and liberal humanism in the West, steered by its elite universities, professors and multilateral agencies. This was used to justify elite stewardship and to rejuvenate a narrative of historical continuity of Hindu orthodoxy, caste oppression, guilt and reparation. This is of course risky business, since there are several pasts but only one present in which to settle accounts. All the same, elite stewardship now presents itself not as the provider of vikas but as the saviour of science, humanism and the oppressed.

The result is that the typical community is now effectively divided into various overlapping and contesting classes of beneficiaries and interests -- SC/ST, APL/BPL, landless peasants, woman-headed households, OBC non-creamy-layer, large farmers, that is, a community without citizens. The sarpanch and the petty government servant are the key contractors. The rights-based discourse also ignores the decades of community work by hundreds of vernacular social reformers, the Baba Amtes of the provinces. The narrative of historical grievance has become more shrill, polarising and self-fulfilling as positions harden on both sides of the caste equation. Finally, it has converted the government job itself as a distributional social good, and deflected attention from the poor service that the typical government servant provides. The job definitions of most government employees, like the collector, the secretary, the teacher, the junior engineer or the gram sevak, are completely outdated and have stopped delivering value long ago. This is the crux of the development delivery problem, and harms the weakest sections of society the most, and yet it is the least analysed by Indian science.

So this is how Bharat is now -- divided, angry, thirsty and parched. Indeed, what unites Bharat is the cultural deprivation, the absence of role models and trust, and the brutishness of a people kept stupid. If there needs to be redistribution, it is not only of wealth and opportunity, but of knowledge and power, and it is not only within Bharat, but across India and Bharat. This must begin by reform at the top, of bringing elite science to serve the common man, of enforcing accountability and discipline on the elite bureaucrat, and a programme of social comprehension at the bottom. The takht of Delhi must gently descend for a new paradigm of the Centre-state relationship to emerge. That is the route to vikas and that should be the manifesto of vikasvaad."

Scheduled Tribes Component across all Ministries witnesses a substantial increase from Rs. 31,920.00 Cr. in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 37,802.94 Cr in 2018-19. Government announces important measures to revamp and expand scheme of setting up EMRSs; 462 new EMRSs to be set up Launch of Van Dhan Yojana by Prime Minister to improve income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people Two National level and four state level museums to celebrate contribution of tribal freedom fighters being set up

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of Scheduled Tribes. The Scheduled Tribes comprise about 8.6% of India's population (according to the 2011 census). In the year 2018, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs focused on education of tribal people, new initiatives to substantially step up economic empowerment of the tribal population as well as bring into spotlight the tribal culture by constructing museums to highlight the tribal freedom fighters. A very major thrust this year has been on revamping and overhauling the prominent scheme of setting up of Eklaya Model Residential Schools to expand the reach of good quality education among the tribal persons.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has continued with its endeavours for socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes (STs) through specially tailored schemes for education, infrastructure and livelihood to fill in critical gaps. Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) of Government now mandates this Ministry to monitor 'Tribal Sub-Plan' (now recoined as 'Scheduled Tribe Component') funds of Central Ministries based on the framework and mechanism propounded by NITI Aayog. In order to consistently improve public service delivery, Ministry of Tribal Affairs constantly reviews various schematic initiatives, recent ones being rationalization of scholarship schemes besides on boarding of same on DBT platform and online portal for NGO Grants.

Budget allocation of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has gone up from Rs. 5329.32 Crore in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 5957.18 Cr in 2018-19. Ministry has already utilized 74.69% of its allocated outlay on various developmental initiatives for STs. An amount of Rs. 2385.90 Cr (as on 09 December, 2018) has been released under two Special Areas Programme of the Ministry viz. Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution for Education, Health, Livelihood/Income Generation Activities etc. Similarly, allocation for Scheduled Tribes Component across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 31,920.00 Cr in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 37,802.94 Cr in 2018-19.

With implementation of Public Financial Management System (PFMS), efficiency in funds allocation and monitoring its release has been improved besides enhancing transparency and accountability. All agencies receiving funds from the Ministry have been on boarded in the system. This facilitates real-time tracking of fund utilization by implementing agencies.

MONITORING OF FUNDS FOR TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT

Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) amended in January, 2017 has mandated the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) for monitoring of STC funds of Central Ministries. An online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs with web address http://stcmis.gov.in for monitoring of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)/Schedule Tribe Component (STC) funds. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and provides inputs to see through expenditure vis-a- vis allocations. Monitoring of physical performance and outcome of initiatives has also been introduced in the system. A customized proforma has also been developed in MIS to capture location of ongoing projects and beneficiary details. Further, Nodal Officer have been designated in line Ministries/Departments for coordination and monitoring. Required credentials are shared with nodal officers for uploading data regarding output and outcome. Review meetings are held regularly for effective monitoring.

There are 37 Central Ministries and Departments having STC funds catering to specific tribal development in various sectors through 299 different schemes, as reflected in the Statement 10B of the Expenditure Profile of the Budget, 2018-19. Allocation for welfare of Scheduled Tribes across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 24,005.00 crore in financial year 2016-17 to Rs. 31,920.00 crore in financial year 2017-18 and Rs. 37,802.94 crore in 2018-19. With the efforts of Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the STC expenditure has gone up from 85% of total allocation at Revised Estimate stage in 2016-17 to 96% in 2017-18. During 2018-19, out of total allocation of Rs. 37,802.94 crore, an amount of Rs. 23,772.05 crore has already been released as on 09.12.2018, which is 62.88% of the total allocation.

As far as State TSP funds are concerned, vigorous efforts of MoTA has resulted in 98% increase in expenditure of State Tribal Sub-Plan funds by States during the years block of 2010-13 (wherein a total of Rs. 1,65,691.00 crore was expended) to 2014-17 (wherein a total of Rs. 3,27,574.00 crore were expended).""

As on 09.12.2018, 63% of the total allocated STC amount has been released by different Central Ministries / Departments against various development projects relating to education, health, agriculture, irrigation, roads, housing, electrification, employment generation, skill development etc.

SCHEME FOR EKLAVYA MODEL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (EMRS)

Eklavya Model Residential School is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. The scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy level between the general population and tribal population.

A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Accordingly, it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

It has also been decided to set up an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs.

The recurring cost has also been enhanced from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

The CCEA decision also spells out reservation of 20% seats under sports quota and 10% for non-ST students.

An outlay of Rs. 118.65 Crore has been made to various states under the scheme Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) for skill development of more than 31,000 male and female tribal beneficiaries in a wide gamut of trades such as (i) Planning and Management including office management (ii) Solar Technician / Electrician (iii) Beautician (iv) Handicraft (v) Skills required for day to day construction works (such as Plumbing, Mason, Electrician, Fitter, Welder, Carpenter (vi) Refrigeration and A/C repairing (vii) Mobile repairing (viii) Nutrition (x) Ayurvedic & tribal medicines (xi) IT (xii) Data Entry (xiii) Fabrication (xiv) Paramedics and Home Nurse Training (xv) Automobile Driving and Mechanics (xvi) Electric & Motor Winding (xvii) Security Guard (xviii) Housekeeping & Management (xix) Retail Management (xx) Hospitality (xxi) Eco-tourism (xxii) Adventure Tourism.

CONSTRUCTION OF MUSEUMS FOR TRIBAL FREEDOM FIGHTERS

Government has conceptualized and planned setting up of permanent museums in States where Tribals lived, struggled against the Britishers, refused to bowdown to alien rule and were far ahead in making sacrifices. Ministry has decided to construct a state-of-the-art Museums for Tribal Freedom fighters of national importance in Gujarat with a total outlay of Rs. 102.55 crore and MoTA's contribution of Rs. 50.00 crore. The second national level museum is to come-up in Jharkhand with an outlay of Rs. 36.66 crore and MoTA's contribution of Rs. 25.00 crore. The Ministry has also shortlisted four other states i.e. Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh for construction of State level museums. Funds released to the states being as below,

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

AADI MAHOTSAV

Ministry of Tribal Affairs organized a National Tribal Festival named as 'Aadi Mahotsava' from 16November, 2018 to 30 November, 2018 with the help of TRIFED to celebrate, cherish and promote the spirit of tribal craft, culture, cuisine and commerce at Delhi Haat, INA. This festival was inaugurated by Sh Jual Oram, Hon'ble Minister of Tribal Affairs.

More than 1000 Artisans from 20 States, 80 Tribal Chefs and 14 Dance Troupes comprising more than 250 Artists participated in the Mahotsav. Highlights of the Mahotsav were - Live demos for traditional tribal food and drink; Lac bangles; demo for 4 different schools of painting i.e. Warli, Pithora, Gond and Saura; Fashion show for tribal textiles, fashion accessories etc. Tribal products displayed at Mahotsav included heritage collection of Sarees, Men's collection including cotton, woollen and silk Jackets, Kurtas from MP, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; Bell Metal from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh; Paintings from Gujrat, Maharashtra, Odisha and MP; Woollens from HP, Uttaranchal and J&K; Honey, spices dry fruits etc. from different States; Tribal Jewellery from Himachal, Odisha, North-East, MP, Telangana; Pottery from Manipur, Rajasthan; Home Furnishing from Rajasthan, North East, MP, UP; Bags collection from Gujrat, Telangana, Jharkhand; and Grass Mat and Coir collection from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Kerala.

It has also been proposed that National Tribal Festivals shall be conducted in 17 States/ Union territories up to March, 2019 to provide a broad platform to highlight tribal culture across India.

NGO GRANTS

Implementation of Online application system ""NGO Grants Online Application & Tracking System"" (www.ngograntsmota.gov.in) activated for processing NGO proposals under the scheme of ""Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for welfare of Scheduled Tribes"" has resulted in quicker information flow and smoother implementation of the scheme besides increasing the number of applications.

MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE FOR MINOR FOREST PRODUCE

The scheme for 'Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP"" (known as MSP for MFPin short) was launched in the year 2013-14 and it then covered only ten MFP items and was applicable to the Schedule V States only. Subsequently, in October 2016 the extent and coverage of the scheme was increased by adding more MFP items and also rendering the scheme applicable country wide. The MSP of ten items that were originally incorporated into the scheme were further revised in November 2017. The issues of further expanding the list of MFP items as also further revising the MSP of the existing MFP items are being considered by the Ministry."

Lok Sabha

The day began with the CPM and Congress giving adjournment motion notices -- handed in to stay the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, which can be moved with the consent of the Speaker -- in Lok Sabha over the Rafale deal and demonetisation respectively.

File image of Parliament. PTI

Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan conducted the proceedings amid sloganeering and ruckus. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) was protesting against the construction of a dam across the Cauvery river. Congress MPs were demanding a joint parliamentary committee probe into the Rafale deal, and the TDP sought to raise issues related to Andhra Pradesh.

When the Lower House convened for the day, more than 40 members from the three parties trooped into the Well, holding placards and shouting slogans. BJP MPs also sought to raise certain issues from their seats.

As the day went on, Congress MPs demanded a joint parliamentary committee investigation into Rafale deal, which forced both Houses to adjourn. ANI quoted Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge as saying: ""We want JPC as we will only get to know everything when Parliament members sit and look into the files. JPCs were formed in the Bofors and 2G cases as well. How can there be a typo? Had it been one word, it would've been understandable, an entire paragraph can't be a typo.""

Kharge added that there were ""irregularities and corruption in the way the Rafale deal was signed."" He pointed out the loss of technology transfer to HAL, as well as the loss to the national exchequer. He demanded a JPC probe to ""fix accountability"". ""Kindly allow this and all details will come out. Every file will be checked by Parliament, not the Supreme Court,"" he said.

Multiple BJP leaders rejected the need for a JPC probe into the Rafale deal, saying that the Supreme Court had made it clear that there were no irregularities. The saffron party then demanded an apology from Congress chief Rahul Gandhi. Health Minister JP Nadda then introduced the surrogacy bill to the Lok Sabha, saying it's a historic day and that all parties wanted commercial surrogacy to be stopped to prevent exploitation of women.

Amid sloganeering and chaos, discussion on the bill ensued. BJD leader Bhartruhari Mahtab said that the surrogacy bill does not define the ""close relative"" who can become a surrogate mother. He also pointed out that the bill does not mention the legal recourse a couple can adopt if their plea for surrogacy is rejected. Adding to the discussion, NCP MP Supriya Sule noted that the five-year ""cooling period"" clause in the bill is not conducive as medical tests can be done to prove a couple's fertility or lack thereof. She also said: ""Sometimes a fertile couple may not have children due to medical reasons, they should not be left out.""

She also noted that the provision of surrogacy only applies to married couples, and that other family structures are ignored. ""If single parents are allowed to adopt, they should be allowed to have surrogates as well."" She concluded by calling it a ""good bill, but not modern enough."" As the din got louder, the Lower House or Parliament finally passed the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016. Mahajan announced that the Consumer Protection Bill will be discussed in Thursday's session.

Rajya Sabha

The proceedings got underway peacefully in the Upper House. The Rajya Sabha was to discuss two important bills related to the education sector. Union Education Minister Prakash Javadekar was to move that the National Council for Teacher Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018 be passed. He was also to introduce the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (Amendment) Bill, 2018 for consideration and passing.

The Rajya Sabha was disrupted consistently, causing Chairman Venkaiah Naidu saying that it was clear members were not ready to allow the House to run smoothly, and adjourned the session for the day. Both Houses will convene at 11 am Thursday.

The Rajya Sabha will not function from 24 to 26 December, so that members can celebrate Christmas back home, Naidu said minutes before adjourning the House. ""Let's utilise the time properly,"" he said, taking a jab at certain MPs.

However, the debate is unlikely to continue with both Congress and BJP sparring over the induction of French made Rafale fighter jest in Indian Air Force.

The BJP, meanwhile, is buoyed by a Supreme Court order which refused to look into the defence deal.

In the legislative business, the government will try to move and pass the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (Amendment) Bill, 2018, The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, and The Nationa Medical CommissionBill, 2017 amid others.
