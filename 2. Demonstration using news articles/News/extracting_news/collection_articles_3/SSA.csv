In a decision aimed at streamlining the teaching cadre in Jammu Kashmir, the State Administrative Council (SAC) under the chairmanship of Governor Satya Pal Malik approved the action pan recommended by the committee constituted vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018.

The committee was mandated to devise a comprehensive strategy to review the issues of all school teachers in the School Education department including those funded under the on-going Government of India-sponsored Scheme 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' (SSA) and suggest possible solutions.

Over the years, School Education department has been facing immense difficulties due to multiple cadres of teachers, requirement of additional funds to meet out salary of both SSA and RMSA teaching faculty and a host of other related issues, which were directly or indirectly impacting upon the quality of education in Government-run schools and leading to avoidable chaos and confusion among the teaching fraternity.

To address the issue in its right perspective and humanely, the State government constituted a committee vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018, Dated 13 August 2018.

The committee submitted its recommendations in the form of an action plan to the government.

The SAC considered the departmental proposal based on the recommendations of the committee and broadly accepted the action plan proposed by the committee.

The SAC approved the creation of a separate cadre of teachers who would get the pay scale of Rs 29200-92300 (L-5) 7th Pay Commission from September 1, 2018 in the School Education department.

These posts shall be filled up 100 percent by selection out of regularized Rehbar-e-Taleem 'Teachers (RReTs) with qualification 'graduate from any recognised university'.

This cadre of teachers is created exclusively for the purpose of adjusting RReTs and would gradually get extinguished or abolished over a period of time.

The School Education department would amend the Jammu Kashmir School Education (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules, 2008 as may be required to give effect to this decision.

RReTs will transition into teachers as procedure laid down in the Action Plan.

The action plan envisages formal merger of 526 posts of headmasters and 3132 posts of subject-specific masters created under RMSA with headmasters and masters in the School Education department, conversion, up-gradation of existing 4522 direct quota vacant non-teaching posts in different categories as teachers, creation of 28,363 supernumerary posts of teachers with the stipulation that these supernumerary posts shall subsist till completion of appointment, transition of eligible RReTs as regular teachers, and thereafter shall cease to exist on the adjustment if these supernumerary posts against normally arising vacancies.

The School Education department has been authorised as a one-time exception to fill certain vacant posts of lecturers by promotion of eligible PG teachers and masters in the relevant disciplines to enable utilization of the resultant vacancies of teachers for appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

This initiative is being taken in the larger interest of the teaching community and purely as a welfare measure.

The School Education department has been granted one-time exemption for making regularization, confirmation, and promotion of the officers (backlog and fresh) in respect of each gazetted category without referring the cases to the JKPSC and DPC.

The 4522 posts of non-teaching staff shall be restored to their original position as and when they become available after adjusting and subsuming all the supernumerary posts.

The School Education department would encourage such RReTs as do not possess the requisite qualification to acquire the same within a specific timeframe so as to up-scale them as regular teachers.

Further, all vacancies of lecturers and teachers referred to PSC and SSB where advertisement notices have not been issued or selection process has not been initiated or written test has not been conducted as on 07.12.2018, shall stand withdrawn.

However, this would not apply to the posts for which selection lists have been published or where document verification is in process.

The SAC directed that a Committee of Officers under the Administrative Secretary, School Education department with Director, School Education Kashmir and Jammu, representatives of General Administration and Finance Department not below the rank of Additional Secretary to Government or equivalent level would oversee the entire process of appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

The School Education department would nominate a nodal officer to maintain a complete record of the vacancies of the lecturers and teachers or in the non-teaching category to ensure proper accounting of the posts created, converted, reverted, supernumerary posts, their adjustment against regular posts, vacancies arising from time to time.

The action plan also envisages creation of a Human Resource Management (HRM) Branch in the School Education department, civil secretariat to deal with Human Resource Management (HRM).

The Committee of Officers constituted vide Government Order No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018 will also examine the cases of 7706 under-graduate teachers who do not possess the qualification as 'Graduate' for their appointment and transition as regular teachers.

The committee would submit its report to the government within a period of one month.

The landmark decision will enable streamlining the cadre of RReTs by transitioning them in the regular cadre of teachers and meeting the salary deficit of SSA and RMSA teachers, which is over Rs 1400 crore per annum, out of the State budget.

Thus all teachers will henceforth get regular monthly salary on time consequent to the assimilation of various cadres of teachers into one regular teaching cadre.

This will result in greater accountability, discipline and capacity building of teachers and improve the quality of education in the State.

Meanwhile, to fast track recruitment and bring in more transparency in the overall selection process, the SAC approved the proposal of dispensing with oral test for selection against the newly created posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.

The recruitment to these posts will now be done on the basis of written tests only.

The SAC in its meeting held on 12 September 2018 had accorded sanction to the creation of 400 posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department for selection through JKPSC in a phased manner.

The SAC had further asked the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department to examine as to whether the recruitment against these newly created posts can be conducted on the basis of written tests only.

The fast-track and transparent recruitment to these posts will fulfil the long pending demand for regularization of Animal & Sheep Husbandry trial centres besides infusing fresh professional talent in the Department for maintaining health and welfare of animals, thereby, enhancing mutton, milk and poultry production in the State.

The SAC also approved the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Bill- 2018.

The Bill seeks to introduce such provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure, Samvat, 1977 which will help in the disposal of cases in a time-bound manner.

These provisions relate to fixing time-frame for filing a written statement and forfeiture of right of defendant to file written statements after the prescribed period.

Besides provision regarding costs have been attuned and a new provision of case hearing management is being introduced.

These modifications are aimed at speedy disposal of civil cases in courts which tend to linger on unnecessarily. Litigants will save time and costs.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Bill, 2018'.

The Bill is a comprehensive law aimed at tackling Benami transactions in the State. The Bill provides for creation of the requisite administrative structure for enforcement of the law and empowers the Designated Authorities to attach and confiscate any property which is held to be Benami.

Panel provisions incorporated in the Act provide for imprisonment of persons found guilty of offence of Benami transactions which shall not be less than one year extendable to seven years, besides fine equivalent to 25% of the market value of the property can also be imposed.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Governor's Special Security Force Bill, 2018''.

The Bill contains provisions related to the constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor, members of his immediate family and matters connected therewith.

The legal framework related to constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Chief Minister, members of his immediate family and other connected matters, is contained in the Jammu and Kashmir Special Security Group Act, 2000. There is no provision contained in the said Act related to matters, for providing proximate security to the Governor of State and his immediate family members. A need has been felt to have an effective mechanism in place for constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor and his family members."

Besides pending salaries, the teachers are yet to receive their pending arrears for the years 2016-17 as per PAB. Reminding that repeated petitions have already been submitted to concerned authorities, the teachers sought that both their pending salaries and arrears are released before December 13 this year.

According to the teachers, the State Project Director (SPD) during a meeting recently assured them that their pending dues would be cleared before Christmas. The teachers urged the Education Minister to follow up the matter to ensure that the assurance is kept.

The month long hunger strike at Jammu and Srinagar had awakened a ray of hope when the teacher leadership was called to Rajbhawan by the governor administration and it was officially ordered by the incumbent governor that September Salary would be released as per 7th pay commission recommendations.Nothing substantial happened.SSA teachers have been waiting since then.Almost two months have passed but their fate didn't change.

Today, I won't write about the contribution, merit, genuineness and legitimacy of their case rather would like to highlight the failure of administration to deliver justice in their case.

Is it official callousness or administrative failure? Who shall be held responsible? Whom to blame? According to reliable sources, the incumbent governor administration had tried its level best to deprive the SSA teachers from the benefits of 7th pay commission and other service privileges but the genuineness and legitimacy of the case didn't allow them to succeed in their designs.

Now, when the genuineness and legitimacy is proven, when there is no doubt about the legitimacy of being a part of state establishment but still then, the resolution of the issue seems to be a distant dream though it has been promised by the people at the helm of affairs.

Treacherous approach of authorities has diminished the hopes of teachers which had risen in September 2018.

How can masses and authorities expect the best from these teachers who have been starving? Whose children and parents are craving for different necessities of life?

I wonder, if authorities consider these teachers as human beings! They are not angels. They do have needs like you and other people. Their children feel the pangs of cold in this chilly winter. Their parents too need medicine.They too have to visit their relatives for different purposes like marriages, mournings etc.

The harshest season of the year has already caught us all tightly.Who knows not the necessary extra expenses of winter? Woollen garments, fuel and some other necessary stuff can't be compromised with but these teachers are cursing their fates for being employees. Piled up miseries have put this community of teachers in virtual trauma.

I won't beg before authorities on behalf of these teachers but I would call it an administrative failure to complicate the issue through deceptive means.

World is making big strides in development, progress and prosperity because these advanced nations have developed and advanced educational systems where teacher is at the top of the hierarchy but our case is totally different and contrasting.

Our people at the helm of affairs too wish to change the system rather brag to make exemplary changes in the system, but ironically, always look for cheap and treacherous means to deny teachers their hard-earned salaries.

Appreciation, acknowledgement and perks for our teachers are not in syllabi of our system. If there is anything for them, it is denial and deprivation.

Our teacher is still 'poor master'. Our public and official perception is still outmoded about our teacher, then how can we expect him to be an European or American teacher who is the virtual king of the country.

Our teacher's American and European counterpart is 24 hour teacher with all the comforts under his feet.He spends his time in the library, equipping himself with the latest trends in academics but our teacher is forced to look for a part time job to provide his family mouthful of meals.

Everyone is cursing the teacher for the messy situation in our educational system but no one dares to look into the reasons that have left the system in the dilapidated conditions.

Let people at the helm of affairs change their attitude towards teachers, I promise miraculous changes in the system but you are playing delaying tactics with your teachers which is sure to spoil the system. Trade union leaders have once again decided to switch over to confrontation path.

Will it yield authorities anything? No, not at all.It will only hit the already poor academic standards of the downtrodden children of our society.Is it a conspiracy against our poor children or is it your callousness towards the teachers of our society.

People at the helm of affairs have adopted silence over this burning issue.It can lead us nowhere as a nation.Strikes and sit-in protests will surely halt our academic progress which is sure to leave us crippled and lame as a nation.

Governor and his team was believed to break the ice because they don't need any vote bank politics to score political mileage but this delaying tactic has dejected the teachers to the extent that they are looking for alternate jobs to feed their children and families.

Is it an achievement to celebrate or a blot to be ashamed off.Yes, it is undoubtedly an ugly blot on our collective conscience because the most respectable working class has been left at the mercy of God to starve. Isn't it the violation of labour rights?

A labourer who works sincerely should be paid in time.Even religious scriptures have laid emphasis on it to pay off a laborer before his sweat dries up.

I pity our administrators who can spend hefty amounts on unimportant things but can't pay their servants.

Now, the onus is on the people at the helm of affairs.Given the legitimacy of the issue, it must be resolved once for all so that our teachers can concentrate on their job without resorting to the path of confrontation.Any further delay can turn things uglier.

Administration must care for its own credibility. Governor's word is equal to a thousand orders but our people are probably made up of cheap stuff who neither respect their own promises nor the words of others.

Hope is life and we live in hope, and let us hope the issue is resolved very soon to give this big community of teachers the much needed relief.

Believe me, official insensitivity and delaying policy in the case has put these teachers to enormous humiliation and anxiety.

Wish our advisors and other higher rung officers would act like true statesmen to solve the grave issue."

The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) has decided not to provide a second set due to shortage of funds.

All these years students used to get two sets of uniforms, one from State Department of Public Instruction and second one from the SSA. Now, due to fund crunch, the SSA has decided not to provide a second set and students will have to manage with only one.

SSA sources said Centre has only released 34% of total funds allocated to the state to run schemes under SSA. Considering this shortage, the officials at SSA have taken a decision to lower the supply of uniforms for the next academic year.

Funds allocated from the Centre under SSA was Rs 1,700 crore for 2018-19, of which it has only received Rs 577 crore. ""Even of this Rs 577 crore, what we got only Rs 370 crore in the first phase. We need Rs 328 crore just to pay the salaries of SSA and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan teachers,"" said a senior official of SSA.

Following the fund crunch, SSA officials have written a letter to the state government requesting additional funds apart from the committed share. ""Of the funds allocated to SSA, 60% comes from Centre and 40% from the state. This time we have requested the state to release additional funds in order to continue programmes,"" explained the official. However, they have not received any communication from the government about their request.

According to the details available, SSA spends Rs 200 per student to provide uniforms, and the total budget needed to supply uniforms is Rs 80 crore. Centre used to provide funds to supply uniforms for girls and students belonging to SC/ST and BPL families from class 1 to 8."

Interestingly, the organisation disclosed that the 'sanctioned salary bill' for three months had been at the directorate of School Education since October 27 2018.

The group issued a press release on Thursday stating that it was 'patiently waiting' for a solution from the government of Nagaland.

'The sanctioned salary bill for three months i.e., June to August 2018 has been at the directorate of School Education since 27th of October 2018,' the press release stated. The association has requested the department to release the salaries at the earliest 'for the sake of the teachers.'

That said, the NSSATA 'acknowledged' the government of Nagaland for taking the decision to bring the SSA and RMSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 ""into the mainstream of the School Education cadre.""

'This decision has brought much relief to the teachers and the association implores the department to initiate the matter with utmost priority,' the group added."

Out of these 10 teachers, four are from Mansa and rest from Patiala, while six are on regular pay rolls.

Among them, Amolak Singh, leader of Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) union, who was posted in Sadda Singh Wala village, about 10 km from Mansa city, has been transferred to the last village of the district, Beerewala Dogra, 60 km away from his last posting. Hardeep Singh Sidhu, ETT union district president, said the ETT teachers cannot be transferred out of the district and hence the last village was chosen. ""Amolak is on regular rolls."" Narinder Singh, district president of government teachers' union, Mansa, was posted in Raipur village of the district. He was earlier in Tarn Taran district. Karamjeet Singh, a science teacher of Dalelwala village in Mansa, has been sent to Amritsar. He is a committee member of democratic teachers' front, Mansa, said Sidhu.

Senior vice-president of government teachers' union Gurdas Singh has been transferred to Hoshairpur from Bajewala village of Mansa. All the teachers had participated in the dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner's office in Mansa. Sidhu said as all the union leaders are active in the ongoing protest, they have been targeted. ""It is an effort to weaken out protest. However, so far no one has joined.""

Villagers also locked schools and staged protest outside them on Tuesday, demanding that the transfers of the four Mansa teachers be revoked. Though District Education Officer Subash Chandra tried to pacify the villagers by saying that teachers on deputation will be sent soon, they refused to relent, saying that the transfers were uncalled for.

On the other hand, Atinder Pal Singh Ghagga, president of DTF, Patiala, has been transferred to Hoshairpur, while Bikram Dev to Gurdaspur, Davinder Singh Poonia, convenor of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, said. ""Both are on regular rolls. A few SSA/RMSA union leaders have also been transferred out. Our protest started from October 7 and is continuing. We are supporting nearly 9,000 SSA/RMSA teachers who have been regularised, but their salary has been reduced from Rs 42,800 to Rs 15,000. We are waiting for a meeting with the Chief Minister on November 5 and will decide our next line of action after that,"" he said.

He added, ""So far our talks with education department officials have failed."" On the other hand, the dharna continued in Patiala and teachers from across the state are joining it.

The 9,000 SSA/ RMSA teachers had been appointed over 10 years ago and after annual appraisals, their salary had reached Rs 42,800, though they were not on government rolls. However, Punjab government recently regularised them and treated them as freshers and hence put them on Rs 15,000 a month salary slab."

Besides, the teachers also sought the provincialization of services of all SSA school teachers given that their counterparts from other parts of the state enjoy the status. With regard to 4 Teachers, the AGHSSASTA while pointing out that the amount of work and hardships endured by them are the same with other SSA teachers demanded that they too are given equal pay at par with the others.

Another demand of the teachers is for their salaries to be released in their individual bank accounts. At present, the teachers receive their salaries through the school's joint account which they said is posing many problems.

""Through the current system, the release of our salary is not uniformed and sometimes delayed. There are also many deductions in the name of transportation fees, school funds, MDM funds, maintenance grants and bank keeping charges.

To avoid departmental action, protesting Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and jalandhar teachers have decided to take an extra hour of classes daily with only four months left for final exams.

Around 8,800 SSA and RMSA teachers have been protesting for the past three weeks across Punjab, with many of them sitting on fast unto death in Patiala.

""We are protesting only after the school timing. But, the government is still alleging that due to our protest, the studies are getting affected,"" said Gurpreet Singh, Jalandhar district president of SSA union, adding, ""To avoid any controversy over this, we have decided to take an extra hour of classes every day after the regular school timing.""

Teachers are protesting at all the places where ministers, Congress MPs, MLAs or leaders go, besides in front of their houses, against their recent regularisation, as per which their initial pay scale will be around Rs 15,000 per month, against their present monthly income of Rs 42,800, along with a three-year probation. It is only after the probation that they will get their full salary.

Government had asked these teachers to either get regularised as per the government salary norms or stay with their previous employer (SSA/ RMSA). Around 1,800 teachers out of 8,800 have opted to become regular teachers with the Punjab government on this condition.

MHRD objected to appointment process 5 yrs ago: Teachers

As the previous SAD-BJP government in Punjab had appointed these teachers by creating SSA/ RMSA societies, the protesters said that they are already teaching in government schools on contract basis, but the latter is not accepting them as their contractual employees. They said that even the central government had advised the state five years back against their appointment through a letter dated March 4, 2013. The letter from Human Resources Development Department (MHRD) said, ""It is found that in Punjab, a separate SSA cadre of contractual teachers has been created, for whom different service arrangements have been spelt out and they are posted only in SSA schools. This is an erroneous phenomenon. All schools receiving SSA funding are schools of the state government, and so are all the teachers. SSA is only a programme providing additional funding to the state for elementary education development and reform."" The letters also say that the state is advised to kindly desist from creating any analogous situation on this account."

Principal Secretary, Finance, Navin K Choudhary on Tuesday chaired a meeting of State Committee set up to address the issues of Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers working in different areas of J&K.

During the meeting, Secretary, School Education, Ajit Sahu made a presentation on the roadmap being worked out by the School Education Department for addressing the issues of the Education Department teachers, including regularization of existing General Line Teachers and SSA teachers, and their promotions.

Sahu briefed the Finance Secretary about the measures taken by the School Education Department, including a proposal for changing recruitment rules, stopping fresh recruitment and promotions of ReTs in a way that it doesn't impact the career prospects of General Line teachers.

Based on the presentation, the resource gap was identified by the Committee in the existing funding for paying the salaries of the SSA teachers and several options were examined to fund the gap.

The Committee recommended that the School Education Department is in a position to pay one-month salary of the SSA teachers which may be approved by the Chief Secretary.

The Finance Secretary said the State Government will take all measures required to fulfill the genuine demands of the SSA teachers while calling for a further discussion on the issue in Jammu after Darbar move.

Among others, Commissioner Secretary, Higher Education, Sarita Chouhan, Director Budget, Imtiyaz Ahmad Wani, State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha, Tufail Mattoo and Director, School Education, G N Itoo, also attended the meeting."

The SSA launched the programme in 2016 with an intention to encourage individuals and old students of government schools to come forward and donate for the development of their alma mater. Till now the SSA has been able to collect only around Rs 70 lakh from donors. Officials say that this nothing compared to Rs 69.6 crore worth of material and other donations they received in kind for development of schools.

There are 45,000 government schools in the State and officials hope greater awareness will fetch more donations. Though the officials are working closely with district coordination teams for creating awareness among public, not many are aware of the initiative.

The officials are actively working on social media platforms to create awareness and seeking donations from non-resident Telugus (NRTs). Speaking to TNIE, G Srinivas, State Project Director of SSA, says, ""It is indeed a great opportunity for the people who are in good position after studying in government schools to develop their alma maters for the future generations. This is the starting point of development, as these schools would be transformed according to the wishes of the donors.

We are conducting various awareness programmes across the State and many people are responding positively. NRTs are also coming forward and offering donations. We are also giving income tax exemption under 80C for a l l donations."" Apart from the donations to the schools, people have been asked to write letters and spread inspirational message among students. As of now, hundreds of letters have been sent to various schools by former students.

Officials and students are also writing to old students urging them to come forward and take part in the initiative. Under the scheme, the donors can specify what the donation is meant for. The names of the persons who has donated the amount or material will be posted on the SSA website. ""The programme is a really good one as it provides a great opportunity for the people who wanted to develop their old school as per their dreams.

Many people might have a dream to establish a school for the poor with best facilities, but they might find it hard in achieving it alone.

As per an order forwarded to them on WhatsApp by the respective District Programme Officers, every staff will have to contribute a month's salary towards CMDRF.

""It says the salary has to be deposited over 10 months,"" said a cluster resource coordinator (CRC) not wishing to be named. ""How can the government ask those on contract and even daily wage workers to give their one month salary from the pittance they are paid?"" the CRC wondered. Even the period for which they are employed doesn't tally with the time mentioned in the order.

""Questions are also being raised about the validity of the order that has been passed on to the staff by the district programme officers via WhatsApp. The order is not written in a letter format that is countersigned by the respective head,"" said another CRC. The CRCs alleged the officers concerned have threatened them with dire consequences if they do not go along with the diktat.

""The government has asked those not in favour of giving the money to send a letter to the officers concerned. But we are being threatened our contracts might not be renewed or we might be transferred to some other place if we refrain from 'contributing' ,"" the CRC said. ""So, who in their right mind will go against the 'order'?"" the CRC asked.

However, the SSA state programme officer of SSA refuted the allegations. ""I just sent the government order which I received. In no way is any pressure being exerted on the staff,"" he said. Another SSA officer said only permanent staff had the obligation.""Only those willing to contribute have been asked to notify it. It will be impossible to deduct the amount from contract staff's salaries since their dates and contract periods vary. Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan is not aware of any WhatsApp message."""

But what about night duty for school teachers? Scores of school teachers - on 'work arrangement' with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) - are currently undergoing a 'night duty' of sorts. After eight hours of work during the day in schools, these teachers - a majority of them women - have to undergo 'review sessions' which may extend up to midnight.

As part of 'Malayala Thilakkam' project of the SSA, the teachers, now re-christened as Cluster Resource Coordinators (CRCs), are undergoing a six-day residential training programme across the state. The teachers had come under the SSA after they lost their posts in their respective schools due to staff fixation.

What bothers the women teachers more is not the workload, but the lack of security or official monitoring in the accommodation provided to them. Take, for instance, the SSA training programme in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts. The teachers, numbering over 40 from both districts, have been accommodated in a lodge-like facility with no security.

""It's hard to convince our families about the peculiar timing of the training programme,"" a woman teacher told Express. ""We do not have an answer to their query as to why the programme extends to such odd hours. There have been instances where some trainers have misbehaved with the women staff during late hours. Most of us are afraid to complain for fear of disciplinary action,"" she said.

SSA officials maintain a residential programme with daily review meetings is necessary to ensure the success of the 'Malayala Thilakkam' programme which aims to improve proficiency in the mother tongue among students.

""Many of the participants will not be able to report on time or do the necessary follow-up if this is carried out as a regular programme. That's why a residential programme has been insisted,"" said Siddique A, SSA district project officer, Alappuzha.

Teachers' unions are planning to petition the Education Minister on the matter. ""Instead of conducting this day-and-night affair, the training programme can very well be extended over a 10-day period where practical sessions can be followed by review the next day. In such a case, women teachers can avoid staying in unsafe places during odd hours,"" said a teachers' union leader."

The decision comes in the wake of the Centre's delay in releasing the fund for salary of SSA teachers.

Replying to a cut motion jointly moved by Congress members Mayralborn Syiem and Kimfa Marbaniang, Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui said the state government took this bold step due to the chronic financial debacle and prolonged delay in the release of fund, especially for the payment of teachers of both Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) schools.

He said the state government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year and every year, the same financial constraints are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary.

Earlier, replying to a call attention motion moved by P T Sawkmie of the Congress on the problems being faced by SSA teachers, Rymbui said the process was on to disburse Rs 132.28 crore sanctioned by the Centre on September 14.

Rymbui said after the delay in releasing the fund, he and the Chief Minister had written to the Centre.

Sawkmie highlighted the plight of an SSA teacher who did not have money to treat his ailing son.

Rymbui said every year, the Project Approval Board (PAB) of the HRD Ministry approves the budget in February but for 2018-19, the PAB approved the budget only on May 25 resulting in the delay. He also informed that after the Union Budget 2018-19 restructured school education scheme into integrated scheme for School Education and Teacher Education, the new name is known as Samagra Shikhsa Abhiyan - a holistic approach to education from pre-nursery to Class XII.

Replying in the Assembly here on Tuesday, education minister Lahkmen Rymbui said, ""In order to mitigate this chronic financial debacle, the state government is taking this bold initiative to create a corpus fund of Rs 78.07 crore so as to maintain the uninterrupted flow of fund due to delay in receiving funds from government of India specially with regards to payment of salary to teachers.""

He informed that the department has been implementing the Central sponsored SSA and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan) in the best of its capacity.

""However due to the delay of fund release by the Central government, the State government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year onwards. Similarly every year, the same financial constrains are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary,"" Rymbui said.

The state had last week received around Rs 132 crore from the centre under SSA scheme which include various components including salary.

Rymbui said that with the implementation of SSA programmes and RMSA, the state has made steady progress for the benefit of both students and teachers.

The state has undertaken several programmes under RMSA to enhance access to secondary education and improve its quality by providing physical facilities like additional class rooms, laboratories, libraries, toilets, besides extending support in the form of school grant, recruitment of 361 teachers with BEd qualification, training of headmasters among others.

Initiating the discussion on the implementation of SSA and RMSA schemes in the state, Congress MLA from Nongpoh, Mayralborn Syiem urged the state government to implement the schemes properly and should see that it did not deny help to schools with good enrollment.

Pointing out support was also extended to schools with single digit enrolment in the state, Syiem demanded that selection of schools should be based on fulfillment of laid down criterias.

Another Congress MLA from Umroi constituency, George B. Lyngdoh cautioned the government over the creation of corpus fund as according to him, the state would find it difficult to manage its resources from the corpus when there is a delay in releasing fund by the Centre."

The association's president, Aristotle Rymbai, said in a statement to the media that a CAG report shows 77 percent of primary teachers and 85 percent of upper primary teachers were untrained till March 2016.

""As per finding of the audit report there was no improvement in the position of untrained teachers both in the primary and the upper primary schools,"" he added.

""Also, 3,437 teachers are yet to start the second year class till date after a lapse of more than one and half year. Further, no teachers were trained during 2010-11 and 2012-13 and during 2015-16,""Aristotle quoted the CAG report.

Rymbai said that a central directive says teachers should have the minimum qualification as per the NCTE norms and the RTE Act by March 31, 2019, for imparting quality education.

""But our question is whether the (state) education minister is aware of all these facts when he talks about quality education. What is the future of our state in the field of education if the problems of teachers are not being taken care of by the government,"" he added.

Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui, while admitting that teachers in the state were facing problems, had said on Teachers' Day that teachers in government schools should bring in quality in teaching for better results in the board examinations.

The association president said if the government wants quality education, it should first take care of its teachers.

The RMSATA-2016 has been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 after the government announced that the monthly salary of the teachers would be reduced by INR 6315.

""Why we can say with conviction that the OM is by nature irrational, invalid and discriminatory is because of the actual guidelines and official documents from the MHRD where this OM has its basis,"" the press release stated.

The association pointed out that in the original draft document of the new scheme stated that ""henceforth there will not be any separate SSA and RMSA teachers; salary as per the new scheme will thus be based only on the different sections of the school they teach viz. primary teachers-Rs 15,000, Upper Primary Teachers- Rs 20,000 and Secondary Teachers-Rs 25,000.

""The memorandum of the dept. itself is also self contradictory as it states that they are following the guidelines of the new scheme fixing the salary of the RMSA at Rs 25,000, very ironically this OM is served only to some 2016 appointed RMSA Teachers, the other teachers of RMSA appointed in the year 2013 and on May 2016 are exempted from this OM."" it alleged

A press statement appended by the president, Penthungo Y Yanthan, and general secretary, Vinoka Sohe of the NSSATA on Monday, stated that according to their appointment orders, the teachers were endowed with a pay scale and other allowances prescribed by the government of Nagaland from time to time with effect from the date of joining.

The association mentioned the RTI reply to Ponchulo Wanth; ""post creation as being a government of Nagaland undertaking and not of the SSA. ""Hence teachers are appointed on a regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.""

Therefore, the association said unlike other SSA and RMSA contractual and adhoc-fixed teachers, the SSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 batch, along with the RMSA 2013 batch are regular employees as per the advertisement and the nature of appointment.

The RMSA 2013 has also clarified the nature of RMSA teachers' appointment and as to why the 2013 batch along with SSA 2010 and 2013 batch were not brought under the purview of the OM.

It stated that they were appointed as regular employees by the government of Nagaland under the Directorate of School Education. It claimed that they enjoy a pay band with all other allowances and rates prescribed by the state government from time to time with effect from the date of joining and deduction towards NPS and GIS which is clearly written in our appointment order issued by the Directorate of School Education and not by the RMSA Mission.

Therefore, the association said that the office memorandum is not applicable to RMSA 2013 and SSA 2010 and 2013 batch."

Kashmiris are peace loving people: Chaya

Srinagar, Aug 28: As the Annual Amarnath Yatra came to an end on Sunday with nearly three Lakh yatries paying their obeisance at holy cave, all the rumours and propaganda that was broadcasted from various News Channels regarding its possible disruption proved hoax and ""fake"".

The civil Society of Kashmir while expressing happiness over the culmination of Yatra peacefully said that Kashmiris would never harm neither tourists nor yatries.

Speaking to KNS, Senior Civil Society member Shakeel Qalander said that the Amarnath Yatra has been going on since ages and Kashmiris would always lend support and help to the Amarnath pilgrims. Mr. Qalander said that the Kashmiris would spend money from their own pockets to facilitate the pilgrimage of Sadhus and other pilgrims, he however regretted that the yatra has unfortunately now been politicized with an aim to malign Kashmiris. Qalander added the Yatra did not even need the security.

Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Hoteliers Club Mushtaq Ahmad Chaya said that despite negative perception and propaganda the yatra ended peacefully which is testimony to the fact that Kashmiri people are peace loving and have a special ability of hospitality.

Talking to Kashmir News Service (KNS), Chaya said that this is also a message to not only to the people of India but to the entire world that Kashmiris are peace loving and have a great tendency of hospitality. He urged the civil societies across the country to encourage people to prefer Kashmir as their first choice tourist destination and added that people to people contact remove the misconception and always bridge the gaps.

Muzaffar Shah, member of one of civil society said that the panelists and others who participated in the debates and discussions had spread poison through the news channels and portrayed bad image of Kashmir.

He, however said that as the Amarnath Yatra 2018 concluded peacefully, the people of Kashmir through the entire period not only exhibited the brotherhood and communal harmony but sent a clear message to the world that people of Kashmir are peace loving.

He said that those who portrayed wrong image of Kashmir through news channels should open their eyes to see the support, communal harmony and brotherhood of Kashmiris.

The civil Society of Kashmir while congratulating the Kashmiri Muslims for facilitating the smooth Yatra said that this was an eye opener for all those so called ""Nationalist Propagandist TV anchors"" who have been hell bent to create a communal divide in the country and use Kashmir as a tool for their own TRPs. But according to Civil Society members, these channels were doing a huge disservice to their own Nation by bringing the communities at logger heads. They wondered how government allows such propaganda on national TV.

The Civil Society of Kashmir has demanded a ""credibility audit"" of all National news Channels so that fake and baseless propaganda is stopped forthwith."

Rain and floods have left a trail of destruction in their wake in the State. Along with houses and establishments, schools too have not been spared of nature's fury.

In Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, and Idukki districts, schools are full of mud and waste, and reptiles such as snakes and centipedes have likely taken shelter inside buildings.

Wells are polluted, and facilities for cooking the noon-meal is in a shambles. Benches and desks too have been damaged. That is not all. With water entering houses, students' study material too has been damaged or destroyed.

Schools reopening after the Onam holidays to such a picture of destruction does not bode well for students and learning, especially since schools in many districts have not had the requisite number of working days this term.

Against this backdrop, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in the State is using its vast machinery to put the schools right before classes resume post-Onam.

Officials from the State level to the cluster resource coordinator level are leading efforts to restore the affected schools to their previous state in a week by working in association with parents' committees. SSA officials and other education workers have been deployed for this purpose.

As many as 78 schools in Pathanamthitta, 128 in Ernakulam, 72 in Thrissur, 49 in Kottayam, 51 in Malappuram, 11 in Idukki, and 302 in Alappuzha are estimated to have been affected by the flooding.

As it is likely to take time for water to drain out from schools under the Veliyanad, Mankombu, and Thalavadi block resource centres (BRCs), activities in Alappuzha will be undertaken in two phases. First the SSA people will clean out the classsrooms, and then health workers will clean up wells and school premises.

Awareness sessions will be held for parents on how to help get schools back on their feet and extend support to their wards.

Equipment necessary for cleaning up classrooms should be purchased, while generator and pumps for pumping out water should be taken on rent if needed.

They may also seek local help for procuring various products.

People's representatives, PTAs or school management committees, voluntary organisations and other stakeholders should be involved in the planning process.

Besides schools, SSA district offices and BRCs too will be cleaned.

The severely affected districts will also have help from other districts in the clean-up.

District project officers will lead the clean-ups in the districts."

If it explodes, the cost and the consequences can be very serious and uncontrollable. What oxygen is to lungs, welfare politics is to general public!

Jammu Kashmir lags behind in giving gainful employment to the educated youth because the state lacks a handsome and healthy private sector which could employ the youth and as such play a role as an employment agency.

The state's colleges and universities end up in producing an army of educated youth with degrees in academic subjects.

In the absence of an advanced private sector, the state employs the academic degree holders in majority in its Department of Education. This trend has increased post 1990s and predominantly after 2000 AD.

In keeping with that trend, about sixty thousand teachers were recruited at school level since year 2000 on the pattern of Rehaber-e-Taleem (ReT). These Ret teachers were categorized as Normal Rets (N-ReT) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Rets (SSA-ReTs). Both the categories of ReTs were recruited through the similar codal norms set by the successive elected governments.

As per the norms, the two categories of ReT teachers were engaged for a monthly honorarium of RS 1500 to 3000 for five years and after the five year period were regularized as General Line Teachers in the then pay scale of school teachers.

For proof, the appointment orders, issued by the Directorates of School Education, can be examined.

Interestingly, the N-ReT category included 80 percent candidates who had passed the matric or the 12th standard and had given up further education. They were doing some other work.

However, the ReT type recruitment drive (done purely at the village/habitation level) made them Ret teachers. In the department, these ReTs went on achieving academic degrees and today they are degree holders. In a way, the Department of Education helped them get these degrees.

Among SSA Rets, seventy percent candidates were having high degrees such as B.Ed/M.ed and post-graduation at the time of their engagement as ReTs. They could have looked for highly paid jobs but the need of a means of livelihood forced them to accept the low paid ReT job. This job promised them job security and a life of happiness and dignity.

After their regularization as General Line Teachers, both the categories of Ret teachers have been given different incentives, allowances, annual increments and their service records have been well maintained like that of the other employees of the state.

However, the irony is that the SSA category of Rets has been excluded from the benefits of the 7th pay commission applied to all state employees, including the N-ReT teachers in April this year.

Neither a formal order has been issued to deny the pay commission benefits to the SSA- ReT teachers nor has an order been issued to give such benefits to them.

Such a situation has forced these 41 thousand SSA teachers to protest. But no response comes from the authorities.

As such, SSA teachers feel discriminated and marginalized. What pains them the most is that their non-SSA colleagues get more salaries than them although all of them work at the same schools for the same students for the same amount of time.

Besides, no 7th pay commission benefits have deprived the SSA-ReTs of the annual increment benefits and will exclude them of the other incentives as well. The pay anomaly will keep on rising with each passing six months.

The situation has created psychological trauma for SSA ReTs. They are state employees and SSA simply is a funding agency to the state. However, their salaries even as per the previous pay scale are not released for three to five months. It seems that these teachers are punished for somebody's political adventurism.

These teachers do not want confrontation with the state for their grave problems if the state gives them the commission benefits and releases their salaries each month.

The state should come clean on the future of SSA category of teachers. Wasting time has served no purpose.

If the state cannot treat them at par with the other employees of the state, then it should give back the crucial years of life to these teachers and compensate for the loss that these teachers had to suffer during their service to the state.

Besides, the state needs to explain the rationale behind keeping these teachers in dark at the time of their recruitment and also explain the present rationale of only depriving them of the service benefits.

Ignoring the plight of these teachers can prove costly. Who knows we may be sitting on a time bomb?"

He further said that because of delay in de-linking their salary from the Central source of funding, these SSA teachers were not getting regular salary with the result that these employees were facing difficulty even to feed their families and deposit school fees of their wards.

Qayoom Wani threatened to hit roads along with five lack employees under the banner of EJAC, if authorities fail to fulfill their demands.

""We have projected these issues from bottom to top and even many peaceful protests have been held in Jammu as well as Kashmir province but still these issues are unresolved, thereby forcing us to come on roads "" he said adding that they had no such attention to leave their schools and come on roads but callous approach of the Government was forcing them for such steps.

A similar but peaceful protest demonstration was held in the premises of Divisional Commissioner Jammu, under the banner of Employees Joint Action Committee, (EJAC) to draw the attention of Governor towards the plights of Regularized ReTs under the flagship schemes of SSA and RMSA.

The speakers highlighted the issues of ReTs and raised slogans in support of their demand for 7th Pay Commission benefits to the SSA teachers and delinking their salary from Central fund.

After the protest demonstration, Ganesh Khajuria, general secretary JKTF, a constituent of EJAS, along with Amrik Singh, N S Jamwal, Jagdish Sharma, Surinder Radotra, Janak Raj Choudhary, Lalit Pandita and Kuldeep Sharma of EJAC submitted a memorandum to the Governor through Divisional Commissioner Jammu urging him to intervene and streamline the salary issue by delinking it from the MHRD budget besides extending the benefits of 7th Pay Commission in their favour."

The District Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has launched a scheme to provide on-site support by a team of trainers to schools.

Usually, one or two trainers from the block resource centres would visit schools to provide them various kinds of support.

To make this initiative more effective, the district SSA has formed entire groups called Team On-Site Support (OSS) to support schools in academic and other activities.

These teams of 10 to 12 members will visit one school in each panchayat and interact with school authorities and students over a couple of days to understand the functioning of the schools so as to make effective interventions, be it in studies, or functioning of class libraries and biodiversity parks. Once the needs are identified, the team will draw up plans on the activities to be taken up and help teachers to implement them. The panchayat education committee will be briefed on the activities taken up in schools, said District SSA Project Officer B. Sreekumaran.

The teams will be led by the block programme officer and comprise trainers and special coordinators.

The teams will later be split into two to cover more panchayats. Starting this month, the District SSA plans to cover one school in each panchayat by the middle of September, before starting the next round to reach out to more schools, he said.

Camps

The District SSA is also conducting camps for differently abled children to identify the equipment they need. Children from Classes 1 to 12 are attending the camps. Children whose equipment has run into trouble are also being covered.

After the camps conclude, a count will be taken of the total equipment needed in the district - be it the number of wheelchairs, or hearing aids, spectacles, or artificial leg. After this, e-tendering will be done to purchase the equipment. The district purchase committee will open the e-tenders and award the work."

A statement from the association on Saturday stated that the SSA teachers of the 2010 and 2013 batches were appointed as regular state employees, based on advertisements and by open recruitment.

""The appointment order clearly mentioned that the teachers will be endowed with a scale pay and 'with all other allowances/rates prescribed by the government of Nagaland from time to time with effect from the date of joining,'"" it stated.

The association cited an RTI reply from the state government in which the latter reportedly stated that 'the post creation is not done by SSA, it is a government of Nagaland undertaking. Hence, teachers are appointed on regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.'

""Therefore, the agitation is in demand of what is rightfully ours basing on the appointment terms, with all service benefits deemed right for a state regular government employee.

""On the basis of the assurances given by the government, we have cooperated patiently trusting that the department would work out a solution. Despite the failure on the part of the government to fulfil the assurance given by them, we are still not demanding for a 'magic formula' to solve our issues.

""The government admitting that there has been a mistake while making appointments does not amount to any defects in the nature of our appointment. The NSSATA is also fully aware that the ongoing agitation is seriously affecting the careers of the students and the quality of education in Nagaland. However, when the teachers are physically and morally disturbed by such uncertain future there is no way the teachers would be able to deliver quality returns to the children even if classes are being held.""

Our Correspondent

Kohima, June 8 (EMN): The Nagaland government has admitted to committing mistakes in appointing teachers, even as the 2010 and 2013 batches of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan teachers are currently on protest. The 2010 and 2013 batch teachers are protesting under the aegis the Nagaland State Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers Association (NASSATA). The sit-in protest entered its third day on Friday in Kohima.

The SSA teachers were recruited for a centrally sponsored scheme, a flagship programme of the union Ministry of Human Resource Development, and are bound by terms and conditions of the programme where their services are to be terminated with the closure of the programme.

During a press conference that was held on Friday afternoon, Chief Secretary Temjen Toy said, ""I must admit that there have been shortcomings on the part of the government, because they were supposed to be appointed against the programme and with the terms and conditions. But then, at that particular point of time, out of oversight or out of whatever reasons the appointments that were given to them were given in the form of any regular appointment. That is one shortcoming we have to admit and call 'spade a spade'. That is the mistake the government made.""

The administrator likened the government's position to being trapped 'between the devil and the deep blue sea.' According to him although the appointments were intended in accordance with the programme's guidelines, the manner in which they were made were not 'proper.'

""So now, we are struggling with that and the Finance department and the School Education department have been struggling to find a solution,"" Toy admitted. He asserted that 'some solution' must have to be arrived at to settle the matter. He said that once the 'initial mess' concerning the appointments is sorted out, 'everything will come into place.'

While acknowledging the problems faced by the SSA teachers, Toy also pointed that on several occasions the government, despite its 'tight resource position,' had 'advanced salaries just to tide over their immediate difficulties.'

On the demand of the association for 7th ROP, Toy reiterated that the government has agreed in principle to revise their salaries. He reminded that the government has to follow certain procedures; clearances have to be obtained and calculations have to be made which is why it is going to take time for implementation. Stating 'full commitment' to finding solutions to whatever problems 'we' are facing in any of the sectors, specifically the SSA, the officer said that the association has to give time to the government to examine the matter.

'Know your place'

All said, Toy bluntly termed the second demand of the association -- transferring their salaries from Plan to Non-Plan -- 'infantile and none of their business to tell the government that our salaries should come from this or that.'

Justifying his use of the language, he said 'Today the term 'Plan and Non-Plan' doesn't exist in government. We don't use those terms anymore. So it is not for any association or group to tell the government that we want our salaries from this and that.'

Toy asserted that 'so far as the government is concerned their salaries come from the flagship programme, but because of the problems in their appointments, some way out has to be found out.'

The SSA teachers have refused to accept their salaries from January-March that have been released already. The association is demanding that it should be released with the 7th ROP entitlement.

Toy maintained that the first demand need to be sorted out. He pointed out that the government was not flush with money. Even if it were so, he said such things take time and requires 'calculated steps to be taken by the government.'

Appeal to call off agitation

The government has appealed to the teachers to end their protest. Pointing out that the future of the children was being held to ransom, Toy expressed regret that 'a group of enlightened and educated persons are behaving in this way.'

""I regret that such demands are being made by the association comprising of qualified education providers, one doesn't expect their maturity to be of this level,"" Toy stated. ""I am sounding harsh but we know our business. We cannot compromise the education of our children.""

The officer maintained that the government will be the first to admit shortcomings on its part and take corrective measures. However, he reminded that just because a section of the government employees would have demands does not mean every demand is justified.

Toy strongly asserted that ""even if they go agitating, the stand of the government is not going to change. We have made our commitment and our commitment stands. It is only a matter a time as there are certain preparations that have to be made and the exercise is going on.""

Reminding the teachers about their responsibilities over students, he assured that the government had been looking into their grievances 'despite the agitation and not because of the agitation.'

Beyond this, he maintained firmly, the government cannot do anything 'agitation or no agitation.' However, he cautioned that if the association still insists on agitating then the government will have to take action according to stipulated procedures and existing laws as the government cannot afford to compromise with the future of the students.

Another officer, Principal Secretary Menukhol John, observed a 'trust deficit' between the government and the association. He has asked the association to give the government time to work on the issue.

Meanwhile, the president of the NASSATA, Penthungo Yanthan, has informed that the teachers will continue with their sit-in protest on June 11 at the Secretariat. He said that while the group 'understands' the problems of the government, the teachers want a written assurance as they were ready to give time to the government to resolve the issue."

One of most important obligations on the part of any Government is to to ensure that all the employees under its control must be paid accurate, Adequate and on time salaries but it is very unfortunate that the same is not applicable to Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers of Jammu and Kashmir. In this State, more than forty thousand teachers who are working under SSA are very often compelled to protest and agitate against irregularities in their Salaries. It is not first time that conflict between Government and SSA teachers in J&K has come into limelight, infact, more or less it is a routine phenomenon since last many years but successive State Governments have given only empty assurances on the name of finding an everlasting solution of this problem.

It is pertinent to mention that these forty thousand plus SSA teachers who constitutes the bulk of teaching fraternity of School Education Department in J&K have played a very crucial role in reviving and rebuilding educational infrastructure which was badly affected during last two decades due to unrest and tumultuous atmosphere in the state. It is well known to everyone that these SSA teachers, majority among them highly qualified were initially appointed on pattern of Rehbar-e-Taleem who served in the department for first five years merely on a very meager salary of Rs 1500 and Rs 3000 on the assurance of the Government that they will get a handful salary regularly after regularisation of their services but it is again an irony that after completion of five years, situation turned worse due to inconsistent and irregular release of SSA salaries. Now it has become a trend that SSA teachers in our State remain without salaries for months together and only after protests, agitations and lockouts their salaries of merely a month or two are credited into their accounts while for several other months remains liability which creates sense of insecurity among the SSA teachers and it is a fact that feeling of insecurity is always inimical to sense of wellbeing, as it causes anxiety and stress which in return harms physical and mental health of these thousands of SSA teachers.

Irregularities and delay in the salary of SSA teachers is not a matter of concern only for themselves, more importantly it is adversely affecting their status as they find it difficult to even satisfy their day to day domestic and social responsibilities due to unavailability of sufficient financial resources. In the absence of salaries they are finding it hard to fulfill very basic needs of their families. Many old and ailing parents of these SSA teachers helplessly wait for the release of salaries of their offsprings so that they may have access to proper treatment for their ailments. Not only this in this era of high inflation SSA teachers face difficulties in satisfying basic needs of their Children due to dry pockets. There is no wrong in saying that prevailing situation has made thousands of SSA teachers and their family members in Jammu and Kashmir so helpless that they find themselves almost on the verge of starvation.

It is matter of serious concern why thousands of SSA teachers who are performing their duties with full dedication and honesty even in remotest areas are not getting their salaries on time ? Although apart from teaching assignments these SSA Teachers are also performing various other duties of National and State interest every now and then. State Government is also using them for different special duties including election duties, census duties, survey duties and many a time even to make Flagship programs like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan successful and popular but in spite of all these neither State nor union Government has taken cognizance of their genuine grievance related to irregularities in disbursement of their salaries.

It is only due to apathetic approach of the Government that these SSA teachers have to very often protested from streets to Secretariat for getting their hard earned money and in this process many a time these teachers had to face harsh treatments like lathicharge and from police in response to peaceful protests in favour of their salary issue. Although peaceful protests and agitations are part and parcel of a democratic set up but it is duty of Government to timely address the issues raised thereof and solve the same in order to avoid their reoccurrence. But in case of salary issue of SSA teachers in Jammu and Kashmir everytime Government has only tried to pacify the SSA teachers rather than working out a permanent solution of the problem.

Now time has come that Government should alter its approach, amd it is need of the hour to workout a constructive mechanism to abolish irregularities in paying salaries to more than forty thousand SSA Teachers in Jammu and Kashmir. It is very much expected that the State Government will now take appropriate action to solve this long pending but very genuine SSA salary issue once for all and once for ever.

Last but not the least one and only panacea of this whole problem lies in streamlining of SSA teachers salary by de-linking it from Central source of funding and release of the same from State budget. It is firmly believed that once salary of these teachers is credited into their Bank Accounts without any delay. This in return will boost the confidence of teachers and they will work with extra amount of zeal and zest which is beneficial not only for more than forty thousand SSA teachers but also for lacs of students studying in Government schools of Jammu and Kashmir.

The union is anxious as almost all the government primary and middle schools in Mokokchung town and other parts of the state are not functioning properly for many months.

According to the union, a rough survey shows that this academic year for the innocent students studying in government schools has been severely affected. It was stated that the first terminal examination has not been conducted till now.

The MTLT questioned the state government, particularly the department of School Education 'whether their conscious allows them to gamble with the lives and educational careers of the thousands of students studying in the government schools.'

The union pointed out that government schools remain the only hope for education for thousands of students in Nagaland.

With the appointment of 'well-qualified' teachers through the SSA (centrally sponsored scheme), the quality of education had witnessed a steady improvement, under Mokokchung town area, the union stated.

The union said the agitations in the education department are seriously undermining the academic careers of the students.

They said that SSA teachers have not received salary for the past three-four months. ""Government is playing with the future of thousands of SSA teachers who are without any salary for last three months. This delay has badly affected our families"", a protester said.

Several protesters were bundled into police vans near Pratap Park here after they tried to march towards Residency Road, bringing the traffic to grinding halt for nearly half an hour. After stepping out of the park the police, equipped with riot gear, stopped the protestors outside the Press Enclave here, used water cannon and baton-charged the agitators to disperse them. Scenes of teachers being hit with batons and high-velocity water from water cannons were also witnessed.

Participants of the rally, who gathered outside the Pratap Park, alleged police of using force against the protestors. ""We were protesting peacefully but the police used force and did not allow us to hold a peaceful march"", a protester said.

In a decision aimed at streamlining the teaching cadre in Jammu Kashmir, the State Administrative Council (SAC) under the chairmanship of Governor Satya Pal Malik approved the action pan recommended by the committee constituted vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018.

The committee was mandated to devise a comprehensive strategy to review the issues of all school teachers in the School Education department including those funded under the on-going Government of India-sponsored Scheme 'Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan' (SSA) and suggest possible solutions.

Over the years, School Education department has been facing immense difficulties due to multiple cadres of teachers, requirement of additional funds to meet out salary of both SSA and RMSA teaching faculty and a host of other related issues, which were directly or indirectly impacting upon the quality of education in Government-run schools and leading to avoidable chaos and confusion among the teaching fraternity.

To address the issue in its right perspective and humanely, the State government constituted a committee vide G O No 1263-GAD of 2018, Dated 13 August 2018.

The committee submitted its recommendations in the form of an action plan to the government.

The SAC considered the departmental proposal based on the recommendations of the committee and broadly accepted the action plan proposed by the committee.

The SAC approved the creation of a separate cadre of teachers who would get the pay scale of Rs 29200-92300 (L-5) 7th Pay Commission from September 1, 2018 in the School Education department.

These posts shall be filled up 100 percent by selection out of regularized Rehbar-e-Taleem 'Teachers (RReTs) with qualification 'graduate from any recognised university'.

This cadre of teachers is created exclusively for the purpose of adjusting RReTs and would gradually get extinguished or abolished over a period of time.

The School Education department would amend the Jammu Kashmir School Education (Subordinate) Service Recruitment Rules, 2008 as may be required to give effect to this decision.

RReTs will transition into teachers as procedure laid down in the Action Plan.

The action plan envisages formal merger of 526 posts of headmasters and 3132 posts of subject-specific masters created under RMSA with headmasters and masters in the School Education department, conversion, up-gradation of existing 4522 direct quota vacant non-teaching posts in different categories as teachers, creation of 28,363 supernumerary posts of teachers with the stipulation that these supernumerary posts shall subsist till completion of appointment, transition of eligible RReTs as regular teachers, and thereafter shall cease to exist on the adjustment if these supernumerary posts against normally arising vacancies.

The School Education department has been authorised as a one-time exception to fill certain vacant posts of lecturers by promotion of eligible PG teachers and masters in the relevant disciplines to enable utilization of the resultant vacancies of teachers for appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

This initiative is being taken in the larger interest of the teaching community and purely as a welfare measure.

The School Education department has been granted one-time exemption for making regularization, confirmation, and promotion of the officers (backlog and fresh) in respect of each gazetted category without referring the cases to the JKPSC and DPC.

The 4522 posts of non-teaching staff shall be restored to their original position as and when they become available after adjusting and subsuming all the supernumerary posts.

The School Education department would encourage such RReTs as do not possess the requisite qualification to acquire the same within a specific timeframe so as to up-scale them as regular teachers.

Further, all vacancies of lecturers and teachers referred to PSC and SSB where advertisement notices have not been issued or selection process has not been initiated or written test has not been conducted as on 07.12.2018, shall stand withdrawn.

However, this would not apply to the posts for which selection lists have been published or where document verification is in process.

The SAC directed that a Committee of Officers under the Administrative Secretary, School Education department with Director, School Education Kashmir and Jammu, representatives of General Administration and Finance Department not below the rank of Additional Secretary to Government or equivalent level would oversee the entire process of appointment and transition of RReTs as teachers.

The School Education department would nominate a nodal officer to maintain a complete record of the vacancies of the lecturers and teachers or in the non-teaching category to ensure proper accounting of the posts created, converted, reverted, supernumerary posts, their adjustment against regular posts, vacancies arising from time to time.

The action plan also envisages creation of a Human Resource Management (HRM) Branch in the School Education department, civil secretariat to deal with Human Resource Management (HRM).

The Committee of Officers constituted vide Government Order No 1263-GAD of 2018 dated 13 August 2018 will also examine the cases of 7706 under-graduate teachers who do not possess the qualification as 'Graduate' for their appointment and transition as regular teachers.

The committee would submit its report to the government within a period of one month.

The landmark decision will enable streamlining the cadre of RReTs by transitioning them in the regular cadre of teachers and meeting the salary deficit of SSA and RMSA teachers, which is over Rs 1400 crore per annum, out of the State budget.

Thus all teachers will henceforth get regular monthly salary on time consequent to the assimilation of various cadres of teachers into one regular teaching cadre.

This will result in greater accountability, discipline and capacity building of teachers and improve the quality of education in the State.

Meanwhile, to fast track recruitment and bring in more transparency in the overall selection process, the SAC approved the proposal of dispensing with oral test for selection against the newly created posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons.

The recruitment to these posts will now be done on the basis of written tests only.

The SAC in its meeting held on 12 September 2018 had accorded sanction to the creation of 400 posts of Veterinary Assistant Surgeons in the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department for selection through JKPSC in a phased manner.

The SAC had further asked the Animal & Sheep Husbandry Department to examine as to whether the recruitment against these newly created posts can be conducted on the basis of written tests only.

The fast-track and transparent recruitment to these posts will fulfil the long pending demand for regularization of Animal & Sheep Husbandry trial centres besides infusing fresh professional talent in the Department for maintaining health and welfare of animals, thereby, enhancing mutton, milk and poultry production in the State.

The SAC also approved the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Bill- 2018.

The Bill seeks to introduce such provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure, Samvat, 1977 which will help in the disposal of cases in a time-bound manner.

These provisions relate to fixing time-frame for filing a written statement and forfeiture of right of defendant to file written statements after the prescribed period.

Besides provision regarding costs have been attuned and a new provision of case hearing management is being introduced.

These modifications are aimed at speedy disposal of civil cases in courts which tend to linger on unnecessarily. Litigants will save time and costs.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Prohibition of Benami Property Transactions Bill, 2018'.

The Bill is a comprehensive law aimed at tackling Benami transactions in the State. The Bill provides for creation of the requisite administrative structure for enforcement of the law and empowers the Designated Authorities to attach and confiscate any property which is held to be Benami.

Panel provisions incorporated in the Act provide for imprisonment of persons found guilty of offence of Benami transactions which shall not be less than one year extendable to seven years, besides fine equivalent to 25% of the market value of the property can also be imposed.

The SAC also approved the 'Jammu and Kashmir Governor's Special Security Force Bill, 2018''.

The Bill contains provisions related to the constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor, members of his immediate family and matters connected therewith.

The legal framework related to constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Chief Minister, members of his immediate family and other connected matters, is contained in the Jammu and Kashmir Special Security Group Act, 2000. There is no provision contained in the said Act related to matters, for providing proximate security to the Governor of State and his immediate family members. A need has been felt to have an effective mechanism in place for constitution and regulation of a separate security force in the State of Jammu and Kashmir for providing proximate security to the Governor and his family members."

The month long hunger strike at Jammu and Srinagar had awakened a ray of hope when the teacher leadership was called to Rajbhawan by the governor administration and it was officially ordered by the incumbent governor that September Salary would be released as per 7th pay commission recommendations.Nothing substantial happened.SSA teachers have been waiting since then.Almost two months have passed but their fate didn't change.

Today, I won't write about the contribution, merit, genuineness and legitimacy of their case rather would like to highlight the failure of administration to deliver justice in their case.

Is it official callousness or administrative failure? Who shall be held responsible? Whom to blame? According to reliable sources, the incumbent governor administration had tried its level best to deprive the SSA teachers from the benefits of 7th pay commission and other service privileges but the genuineness and legitimacy of the case didn't allow them to succeed in their designs.

Now, when the genuineness and legitimacy is proven, when there is no doubt about the legitimacy of being a part of state establishment but still then, the resolution of the issue seems to be a distant dream though it has been promised by the people at the helm of affairs.

Treacherous approach of authorities has diminished the hopes of teachers which had risen in September 2018.

How can masses and authorities expect the best from these teachers who have been starving? Whose children and parents are craving for different necessities of life?

I wonder, if authorities consider these teachers as human beings! They are not angels. They do have needs like you and other people. Their children feel the pangs of cold in this chilly winter. Their parents too need medicine.They too have to visit their relatives for different purposes like marriages, mournings etc.

The harshest season of the year has already caught us all tightly.Who knows not the necessary extra expenses of winter? Woollen garments, fuel and some other necessary stuff can't be compromised with but these teachers are cursing their fates for being employees. Piled up miseries have put this community of teachers in virtual trauma.

I won't beg before authorities on behalf of these teachers but I would call it an administrative failure to complicate the issue through deceptive means.

World is making big strides in development, progress and prosperity because these advanced nations have developed and advanced educational systems where teacher is at the top of the hierarchy but our case is totally different and contrasting.

Our people at the helm of affairs too wish to change the system rather brag to make exemplary changes in the system, but ironically, always look for cheap and treacherous means to deny teachers their hard-earned salaries.

Appreciation, acknowledgement and perks for our teachers are not in syllabi of our system. If there is anything for them, it is denial and deprivation.

Our teacher is still 'poor master'. Our public and official perception is still outmoded about our teacher, then how can we expect him to be an European or American teacher who is the virtual king of the country.

Our teacher's American and European counterpart is 24 hour teacher with all the comforts under his feet.He spends his time in the library, equipping himself with the latest trends in academics but our teacher is forced to look for a part time job to provide his family mouthful of meals.

Everyone is cursing the teacher for the messy situation in our educational system but no one dares to look into the reasons that have left the system in the dilapidated conditions.

Let people at the helm of affairs change their attitude towards teachers, I promise miraculous changes in the system but you are playing delaying tactics with your teachers which is sure to spoil the system. Trade union leaders have once again decided to switch over to confrontation path.

Will it yield authorities anything? No, not at all.It will only hit the already poor academic standards of the downtrodden children of our society.Is it a conspiracy against our poor children or is it your callousness towards the teachers of our society.

People at the helm of affairs have adopted silence over this burning issue.It can lead us nowhere as a nation.Strikes and sit-in protests will surely halt our academic progress which is sure to leave us crippled and lame as a nation.

Governor and his team was believed to break the ice because they don't need any vote bank politics to score political mileage but this delaying tactic has dejected the teachers to the extent that they are looking for alternate jobs to feed their children and families.

Is it an achievement to celebrate or a blot to be ashamed off.Yes, it is undoubtedly an ugly blot on our collective conscience because the most respectable working class has been left at the mercy of God to starve. Isn't it the violation of labour rights?

A labourer who works sincerely should be paid in time.Even religious scriptures have laid emphasis on it to pay off a laborer before his sweat dries up.

I pity our administrators who can spend hefty amounts on unimportant things but can't pay their servants.

Now, the onus is on the people at the helm of affairs.Given the legitimacy of the issue, it must be resolved once for all so that our teachers can concentrate on their job without resorting to the path of confrontation.Any further delay can turn things uglier.

Administration must care for its own credibility. Governor's word is equal to a thousand orders but our people are probably made up of cheap stuff who neither respect their own promises nor the words of others.

Hope is life and we live in hope, and let us hope the issue is resolved very soon to give this big community of teachers the much needed relief.

Believe me, official insensitivity and delaying policy in the case has put these teachers to enormous humiliation and anxiety.

The Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) has decided not to provide a second set due to shortage of funds.

All these years students used to get two sets of uniforms, one from State Department of Public Instruction and second one from the SSA. Now, due to fund crunch, the SSA has decided not to provide a second set and students will have to manage with only one.

SSA sources said Centre has only released 34% of total funds allocated to the state to run schemes under SSA. Considering this shortage, the officials at SSA have taken a decision to lower the supply of uniforms for the next academic year.

Funds allocated from the Centre under SSA was Rs 1,700 crore for 2018-19, of which it has only received Rs 577 crore. ""Even of this Rs 577 crore, what we got only Rs 370 crore in the first phase. We need Rs 328 crore just to pay the salaries of SSA and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan teachers,"" said a senior official of SSA.

Following the fund crunch, SSA officials have written a letter to the state government requesting additional funds apart from the committed share. ""Of the funds allocated to SSA, 60% comes from Centre and 40% from the state. This time we have requested the state to release additional funds in order to continue programmes,"" explained the official. However, they have not received any communication from the government about their request.

According to the details available, SSA spends Rs 200 per student to provide uniforms, and the total budget needed to supply uniforms is Rs 80 crore. Centre used to provide funds to supply uniforms for girls and students belonging to SC/ST and BPL families from class 1 to 8."

Interestingly, the organisation disclosed that the 'sanctioned salary bill' for three months had been at the directorate of School Education since October 27 2018.

The group issued a press release on Thursday stating that it was 'patiently waiting' for a solution from the government of Nagaland.

The statement read: 'The Nagaland Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Association (NSSATA) 2010 and 2013 batch, as per the agreement made with the government of Nagaland in the presence of the Naga Students' Federation and the Eastern Naga Students' Federation, on the 12th of June 2018 is patiently waiting for a positive and a permanent solution to end the grievances which the teachers have been facing since the time of appointment.'

In spite of all these, the press release stated, the teachers have not been paid for five months i.e., June to October 2018.

'Therefore, the NSSATA appeals to the government of Nagaland to release the five months pending salary at the earliest.

Hardeep Singh Sidhu, ETT union district president, said the ETT teachers cannot be transferred out of the district and hence the last village was chosen. ""Amolak is on regular rolls."" Narinder Singh, district president of government teachers' union, Mansa, was posted in Raipur village of the district. He was earlier in Tarn Taran district.

Villagers also locked schools and staged protest outside them on Tuesday, demanding that the transfers of the four Mansa teachers be revoked.

To avoid departmental action, protesting Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and jalandhar teachers have decided to take an extra hour of classes daily with only four months left for final exams.

Around 8,800 SSA and RMSA teachers have been protesting for the past three weeks across Punjab, with many of them sitting on fast unto death in Patiala.

""We are protesting only after the school timing. But, the government is still alleging that due to our protest, the studies are getting affected,"" said Gurpreet Singh, Jalandhar district president of SSA union, adding, ""To avoid any controversy over this, we have decided to take an extra hour of classes every day after the regular school timing.""

Teachers are protesting at all the places where ministers, Congress MPs, MLAs or leaders go, besides in front of their houses, against their recent regularisation, as per which their initial pay scale will be around Rs 15,000 per month, against their present monthly income of Rs 42,800, along with a three-year probation. It is only after the probation that they will get their full salary.

Government had asked these teachers to either get regularised as per the government salary norms or stay with their previous employer (SSA/ RMSA). Around 1,800 teachers out of 8,800 have opted to become regular teachers with the Punjab government on this condition.

MHRD objected to appointment process 5 yrs ago: Teachers

As the previous SAD-BJP government in Punjab had appointed these teachers by creating SSA/ RMSA societies, the protesters said that they are already teaching in government schools on contract basis, but the latter is not accepting them as their contractual employees. They said that even the central government had advised the state five years back against their appointment through a letter dated March 4, 2013. The letter from Human Resources Development Department (MHRD) said, ""It is found that in Punjab, a separate SSA cadre of contractual teachers has been created, for whom different service arrangements have been spelt out and they are posted only in SSA schools. This is an erroneous phenomenon. All schools receiving SSA funding are schools of the state government, and so are all the teachers. SSA is only a programme providing additional funding to the state for elementary education development and reform."" The letters also say that the state is advised to kindly desist from creating any analogous situation on this account."

Principal Secretary, Finance, Navin K Choudhary on Tuesday chaired a meeting of State Committee set up to address the issues of Sarva Shikhsha Abhiyan (SSA) teachers working in different areas of J&K.

During the meeting, Secretary, School Education, Ajit Sahu made a presentation on the roadmap being worked out by the School Education Department for addressing the issues of the Education Department teachers, including regularization of existing General Line Teachers and SSA teachers, and their promotions.

Sahu briefed the Finance Secretary about the measures taken by the School Education Department, including a proposal for changing recruitment rules, stopping fresh recruitment and promotions of ReTs in a way that it doesn't impact the career prospects of General Line teachers.

Based on the presentation, the resource gap was identified by the Committee in the existing funding for paying the salaries of the SSA teachers and several options were examined to fund the gap.

The Committee recommended that the School Education Department is in a position to pay one-month salary of the SSA teachers which may be approved by the Chief Secretary.

The Finance Secretary said the State Government will take all measures required to fulfill the genuine demands of the SSA teachers while calling for a further discussion on the issue in Jammu after Darbar move.

Among others, Commissioner Secretary, Higher Education, Sarita Chouhan, Director Budget, Imtiyaz Ahmad Wani, State Project Director, Samagra Shiksha, Tufail Mattoo and Director, School Education, G N Itoo, also attended the meeting."

The SSA launched the programme in 2016 with an intention to encourage individuals and old students of government schools to come forward and donate for the development of their alma mater. Till now the SSA has been able to collect only around Rs 70 lakh from donors. Officials say that this nothing compared to Rs 69.6 crore worth of material and other donations they received in kind for development of schools.

There are 45,000 government schools in the State and officials hope greater awareness will fetch more donations. Though the officials are working closely with district coordination teams for creating awareness among public, not many are aware of the initiative.

The officials are actively working on social media platforms to create awareness and seeking donations from non-resident Telugus (NRTs). Speaking to TNIE, G Srinivas, State Project Director of SSA, says, ""It is indeed a great opportunity for the people who are in good position after studying in government schools to develop their alma maters for the future generations. This is the starting point of development, as these schools would be transformed according to the wishes of the donors.

We are conducting various awareness programmes across the State and many people are responding positively. NRTs are also coming forward and offering donations. We are also giving income tax exemption under 80C for a l l donations."" Apart from the donations to the schools, people have been asked to write letters and spread inspirational message among students. As of now, hundreds of letters have been sent to various schools by former students.

Officials and students are also writing to old students urging them to come forward and take part in the initiative. Under the scheme, the donors can specify what the donation is meant for. The names of the persons who has donated the amount or material will be posted on the SSA website. ""The programme is a really good one as it provides a great opportunity for the people who wanted to develop their old school as per their dreams.

Many people might have a dream to establish a school for the poor with best facilities, but they might find it hard in achieving it alone. With this initiative, they can donate to the school and develop them as per their wish. We are expecting good development in the schools with best infrastructure, libraries,"" said N Bhaskar Rao, principal of a government school."

As per an order forwarded to them on WhatsApp by the respective District Programme Officers, every staff will have to contribute a month's salary towards CMDRF.

""It says the salary has to be deposited over 10 months,"" said a cluster resource coordinator (CRC) not wishing to be named. ""How can the government ask those on contract and even daily wage workers to give their one month salary from the pittance they are paid?"" the CRC wondered. Even the period for which they are employed doesn't tally with the time mentioned in the order.

""Questions are also being raised about the validity of the order that has been passed on to the staff by the district programme officers via WhatsApp. The order is not written in a letter format that is countersigned by the respective head,"" said another CRC. The CRCs alleged the officers concerned have threatened them with dire consequences if they do not go along with the diktat.

""The government has asked those not in favour of giving the money to send a letter to the officers concerned. But we are being threatened our contracts might not be renewed or we might be transferred to some other place if we refrain from 'contributing' ,"" the CRC said. ""So, who in their right mind will go against the 'order'?"" the CRC asked.

However, the SSA state programme officer of SSA refuted the allegations. ""I just sent the government order which I received. In no way is any pressure being exerted on the staff,"" he said.

But what about night duty for school teachers? Scores of school teachers - on 'work arrangement' with the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) - are currently undergoing a 'night duty' of sorts. After eight hours of work during the day in schools, these teachers - a majority of them women - have to undergo 'review sessions' which may extend up to midnight.

As part of 'Malayala Thilakkam' project of the SSA, the teachers, now re-christened as Cluster Resource Coordinators (CRCs), are undergoing a six-day residential training programme across the state. The teachers had come under the SSA after they lost their posts in their respective schools due to staff fixation.

What bothers the women teachers more is not the workload, but the lack of security or official monitoring in the accommodation provided to them. Take, for instance, the SSA training programme in Alappuzha and Pathanamthitta districts. The teachers, numbering over 40 from both districts, have been accommodated in a lodge-like facility with no security.

""It's hard to convince our families about the peculiar timing of the training programme,"" a woman teacher told Express. ""We do not have an answer to their query as to why the programme extends to such odd hours. There have been instances where some trainers have misbehaved with the women staff during late hours. Most of us are afraid to complain for fear of disciplinary action,"" she said.

SSA officials maintain a residential programme with daily review meetings is necessary to ensure the success of the 'Malayala Thilakkam' programme which aims to improve proficiency in the mother tongue among students.

""Many of the participants will not be able to report on time or do the necessary follow-up if this is carried out as a regular programme. That's why a residential programme has been insisted,"" said Siddique A, SSA district project officer, Alappuzha.

Teachers' unions are planning to petition the Education Minister on the matter. ""Instead of conducting this day-and-night affair, the training programme can very well be extended over a 10-day period where practical sessions can be followed by review the next day. In such a case, women teachers can avoid staying in unsafe places during odd hours,"" said a teachers' union leader."

The decision comes in the wake of the Centre's delay in releasing the fund for salary of SSA teachers.

Replying to a cut motion jointly moved by Congress members Mayralborn Syiem and Kimfa Marbaniang, Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui said the state government took this bold step due to the chronic financial debacle and prolonged delay in the release of fund, especially for the payment of teachers of both Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) schools.

He said the state government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year and every year, the same financial constraints are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary.

Earlier, replying to a call attention motion moved by P T Sawkmie of the Congress on the problems being faced by SSA teachers, Rymbui said the process was on to disburse Rs 132.28 crore sanctioned by the Centre on September 14.

Rymbui said after the delay in releasing the fund, he and the Chief Minister had written to the Centre.

Sawkmie highlighted the plight of an SSA teacher who did not have money to treat his ailing son.

Rymbui said every year, the Project Approval Board (PAB) of the HRD Ministry approves the budget in February but for 2018-19, the PAB approved the budget only on May 25 resulting in the delay. He also informed that after the Union Budget 2018-19 restructured school education scheme into integrated scheme for School Education and Teacher Education, the new name is known as Samagra Shikhsa Abhiyan - a holistic approach to education from pre-nursery to Class XII.

Rymbui said Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan subsumes three schemes, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan and Teacher Education, which fall under the central support scheme."

Replying in the Assembly here on Tuesday, education minister Lahkmen Rymbui said, ""In order to mitigate this chronic financial debacle, the state government is taking this bold initiative to create a corpus fund of Rs 78.07 crore so as to maintain the uninterrupted flow of fund due to delay in receiving funds from government of India specially with regards to payment of salary to teachers.""

He informed that the department has been implementing the Central sponsored SSA and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan) in the best of its capacity.

""However due to the delay of fund release by the Central government, the State government could not release the salary of teachers from April this year onwards. Similarly every year, the same financial constrains are being repeated leading to recurring liabilities towards teachers' salary,"" Rymbui said.

A total of 2,907 lower primary and 2,232 upper primary schools have been opened under SSA in Meghalaya and the monthly salary for each SSA teacher of lower primary schools is Rs 19,044 and Rs 20,493 for each SSA teacher of upper primary schools.

The state had last week received around Rs 132 crore from the centre under SSA scheme which include various components including salary.

Rymbui said that with the implementation of SSA programmes and RMSA, the state has made steady progress for the benefit of both students and teachers.

The state has undertaken several programmes under RMSA to enhance access to secondary education and improve its quality by providing physical facilities like additional class rooms, laboratories, libraries, toilets, besides extending support in the form of school grant, recruitment of 361 teachers with BEd qualification, training of headmasters among others.

Initiating the discussion on the implementation of SSA and RMSA schemes in the state, Congress MLA from Nongpoh, Mayralborn Syiem urged the state government to implement the schemes properly and should see that it did not deny help to schools with good enrollment.

Pointing out support was also extended to schools with single digit enrolment in the state, Syiem demanded that selection of schools should be based on fulfillment of laid down criterias.

Another Congress MLA from Umroi constituency, George B. Lyngdoh cautioned the government over the creation of corpus fund as according to him, the state would find it difficult to manage its resources from the corpus when there is a delay in releasing fund by the Centre."

Informing that the state government would need an additional amount of over Rs 100 crore since the Centre has decided to cap the salary in the current year, Sangma said the state government has fixed two slabs for SSA teachers' salary.

""The first category of teachers is getting Rs 19,000 a month and the second category Rs 15,000. There are states which are paying Rs 28,000 and even Rs 30,000 to SSA teachers,"" Sangma said.

The Centre has decided to cap the amount at Rs 15,000, ""which means the remaining amount has to be borne by states"" and most of the states ""are not happy with the decision"".

""We need to carry out a lot of exercise with the Finance Department and Revenue generating departments to mobilise the additional fund for payment of the salaries of the teachers,"" he said.

SSA teachers in the state decided to shun celebrations on Wednesday and organise a sit-in demonstration at the Additional Secretariat parking lot.

""In the past four months, the state government has been negotiating and discussing with the Centre for the benefit of the SSA teachers in the State. But we had to finally agreed to few of the terms and conditions that had been laid down by the Government since there were a lot of pressure from teacher to release their salaries,"" the chief minister said and added that there would be ""a huge impact on state budget"".

There are about 13,000 SSA teachers in the state.

A Garo organisation has also written to the chief minister requesting equal pay to SSA 4th teachers for equal work.

""It is learnt that the state government is not giving equal pay, despite the work being same; there is no parity of pay between the assistant teachers (central government sponsored) and the 4th teachers (state sponsored). The assistant teachers draw a sum of Rs 20,493 per month whereas state government sponsored 4th teachers are getting only Rs 12,000,"" said Maxbirth Gabil Momin, general secretary of the A'chik Youth Council.

The protesting SSA teachers who observed the Teacgers day as 'Black Day' tried to march towards SKICC Srinagar but by police swung into action and used batons and coloured water to stop them from marching towards Sheri Kashmir International Convention Centre (SKICC) where Directorate of School Education was celebrating Teachers Day 2018. Police also detained scores of the protesting teachers after they tried to block the Residency Road.

The protesters assembled here in Sher-e-Kashmir Park and started shouting slogans against the government for not fulfilling their demands saying that every time government compels them to hit the streets.

Bashir Ahmad Parray, an SSA teacher at a Government School in Central Kashmir's Budgam district said, ""I also want to celebrate this day with my students but due to this 7th pay commission issue I am suffering from mental trauma.""

Hailing from Ratnipora village of Budgam district, Parray is a teacher at Government Girls Middle School, Kulbugh.

45-year-old Parray said there are many SSA teachers also who are yet to be regularised especially those who have completed a contractual term of five years.

He said there are hundreds of teachers who are not being regularised despite the fact that after completion of five years as Rehbar-e-Taleem, they are as good as general line teachers; and there is a proper order issued by the Government in this regard.

Another protesting teacher said, ""Time bound departmental promotions to the teachers have been also stopped. As per the guidelines, it is the right of a teacher to get such promotion after completing nine years in the education department.""

He further said all this is being done so that the department does not give us 7th pay commission benefits and the irony is that a Class IV employee recruited just 2-3 years ago is getting the pay commission benefits and we are the only ones left out."

""I must tell the SSA teachers who are on strike on the eve of Teachers Day that government is concerned for them regarding their legitimate right and their demand of 7th pay commission deserves the highest consideration and therefore government should review this issue immediately,"" Ganai said.

He said this while addressing teachers and officials of education department here at Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre (SKICC) during a function organized by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) to celebrate Teachers Day.

Congratulating the teachers on teacher's day, Ganai said that the committee constituted has been asked to expedite the report so that the government will take immediate steps.

He also said that he had already appealed to SSA teachers not to take extreme steps and have assured them that government is concerned for them.

""We were getting a specific amount from the central government for the SSA teachers and masters and the funds were financially helping a lot to the state government but since they have reduced the payment by more than 50 percent, a financial crunch has emerged in the state,"" Ganai said.

Speaking on the occasion, Secretary School Education, Rigzin Sampheal referred teachers as the ""custodians and conscious keepers of a nation,"" and said teaching is an art of grooming leaders.

The Secretary stressed the need of nudging the students to dream big. Giving an example of former President of India and a scientist APJ Kalam, Sampheal said APJ Kalam used to reiterate the importance of thinking big.

""APJ Kalam used to say ""thinking small is a sin,"" said Sampheal.

The Secretary expressed his optimism that the future of students is in the bright hands of teachers who are serving the State's education department.

Vice Chancellor (VC) Cluster University Srinagar, Professor Sheikh Javeed said the credit of whatever, he achieved in his life goes to his teacher who always advised him to see the bigger picture in life.

The RMSATA-2016 has been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 after the government announced that the monthly salary of the teachers would be reduced by INR 6315.

""Why we can say with conviction that the OM is by nature irrational, invalid and discriminatory is because of the actual guidelines and official documents from the MHRD where this OM has its basis,"" the press release stated.

The association pointed out that in the original draft document of the new scheme stated that ""henceforth there will not be any separate SSA and RMSA teachers; salary as per the new scheme will thus be based only on the different sections of the school they teach viz. primary teachers-Rs 15,000, Upper Primary Teachers- Rs 20,000 and Secondary Teachers-Rs 25,000. We the RMSA 2016 Teachers fall under the category of secondary teachers with an amount of Rs 25,000.""

According to the statement given in the document, it said that all the SSA teachers who are predominantly engaged in teaching the primary and upper primary sections will be receiving only INR 15,000 and INR 20,000. However, it stated that the OM was not served to them.

""The memorandum of the dept. itself is also self contradictory as it states that they are following the guidelines of the new scheme fixing the salary of the RMSA at Rs 25,000, very ironically this OM is served only to some 2016 appointed RMSA Teachers, the other teachers of RMSA appointed in the year 2013 and on May 2016 are exempted from this OM."" it alleged

The association also pointed out the Project Approval Board minutes of the SSA, MHRD which stated; ""State should meet the balance amount from its own resources including the additional funds devolved under the 14th Finance Commission. As per Section 7(5) of the RTE Act, 2009, the State Government shall after taking into consideration the sum, provided by the Central Government and mandatory matching State share, provide the balance funds necessary to fulfill the estimate for the implementation of the Act.""

It asserted that when the state can meet the additional funds (funds apart from central and state matching share) of SSA and other RMSA teachers, it can in no way take the excuse of fund constrains of the state and discriminate a certain section of its employees who fall under the same scheme.

The Nagaland Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Association (NSSATA) of the 2010 and 2013 batches had claimed that the NSSATA (2010 and 2013 batches) were appointed as regular employees according to the nature of appointment.

The association mentioned the RTI reply to Ponchulo Wanth; ""post creation as being a government of Nagaland undertaking and not of the SSA. ""Hence teachers are appointed on a regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.""

Therefore, the association said unlike other SSA and RMSA contractual and adhoc-fixed teachers, the SSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 batch, along with the RMSA 2013 batch are regular employees as per the advertisement and the nature of appointment.

The RMSA 2013 has also clarified the nature of RMSA teachers' appointment and as to why the 2013 batch along with SSA 2010 and 2013 batch were not brought under the purview of the OM.

Pertinently, in the year 2018, loss of more than 20 academic days was witnessed due to these protests and this year the SSA teachers have protested more than 25 times so far."

Kashmiris are peace loving people: Chaya

Srinagar, Aug 28: As the Annual Amarnath Yatra came to an end on Sunday with nearly three Lakh yatries paying their obeisance at holy cave, all the rumours and propaganda that was broadcasted from various News Channels regarding its possible disruption proved hoax and ""fake"".

The civil Society of Kashmir while expressing happiness over the culmination of Yatra peacefully said that Kashmiris would never harm neither tourists nor yatries.

Speaking to KNS, Senior Civil Society member Shakeel Qalander said that the Amarnath Yatra has been going on since ages and Kashmiris would always lend support and help to the Amarnath pilgrims. Mr. Qalander said that the Kashmiris would spend money from their own pockets to facilitate the pilgrimage of Sadhus and other pilgrims, he however regretted that the yatra has unfortunately now been politicized with an aim to malign Kashmiris. Qalander added the Yatra did not even need the security.

Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Hoteliers Club Mushtaq Ahmad Chaya said that despite negative perception and propaganda the yatra ended peacefully which is testimony to the fact that Kashmiri people are peace loving and have a special ability of hospitality.

Talking to Kashmir News Service (KNS), Chaya said that this is also a message to not only to the people of India but to the entire world that Kashmiris are peace loving and have a great tendency of hospitality. He urged the civil societies across the country to encourage people to prefer Kashmir as their first choice tourist destination and added that people to people contact remove the misconception and always bridge the gaps.

Muzaffar Shah, member of one of civil society said that the panelists and others who participated in the debates and discussions had spread poison through the news channels and portrayed bad image of Kashmir.

He, however said that as the Amarnath Yatra 2018 concluded peacefully, the people of Kashmir through the entire period not only exhibited the brotherhood and communal harmony but sent a clear message to the world that people of Kashmir are peace loving.

He said that those who portrayed wrong image of Kashmir through news channels should open their eyes to see the support, communal harmony and brotherhood of Kashmiris.

The civil Society of Kashmir while congratulating the Kashmiri Muslims for facilitating the smooth Yatra said that this was an eye opener for all those so called ""Nationalist Propagandist TV anchors"" who have been hell bent to create a communal divide in the country and use Kashmir as a tool for their own TRPs. But according to Civil Society members, these channels were doing a huge disservice to their own Nation by bringing the communities at logger heads. They wondered how government allows such propaganda on national TV.

The Civil Society of Kashmir has demanded a ""credibility audit"" of all National news Channels so that fake and baseless propaganda is stopped forthwith."

Rain and floods have left a trail of destruction in their wake in the State. Along with houses and establishments, schools too have not been spared of nature's fury.

In Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, and Idukki districts, schools are full of mud and waste, and reptiles such as snakes and centipedes have likely taken shelter inside buildings.

Wells are polluted, and facilities for cooking the noon-meal is in a shambles. Benches and desks too have been damaged. That is not all. With water entering houses, students' study material too has been damaged or destroyed.

Schools reopening after the Onam holidays to such a picture of destruction does not bode well for students and learning, especially since schools in many districts have not had the requisite number of working days this term.

Against this backdrop, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) in the State is using its vast machinery to put the schools right before classes resume post-Onam.

Officials from the State level to the cluster resource coordinator level are leading efforts to restore the affected schools to their previous state in a week by working in association with parents' committees. SSA officials and other education workers have been deployed for this purpose.

As many as 78 schools in Pathanamthitta, 128 in Ernakulam, 72 in Thrissur, 49 in Kottayam, 51 in Malappuram, 11 in Idukki, and 302 in Alappuzha are estimated to have been affected by the flooding.

As it is likely to take time for water to drain out from schools under the Veliyanad, Mankombu, and Thalavadi block resource centres (BRCs), activities in Alappuzha will be undertaken in two phases. First the SSA people will clean out the classsrooms, and then health workers will clean up wells and school premises.

Awareness sessions will be held for parents on how to help get schools back on their feet and extend support to their wards.

Equipment necessary for cleaning up classrooms should be purchased, while generator and pumps for pumping out water should be taken on rent if needed.

They may also seek local help for procuring various products.

People's representatives, PTAs or school management committees, voluntary organisations and other stakeholders should be involved in the planning process.

Besides schools, SSA district offices and BRCs too will be cleaned.

The severely affected districts will also have help from other districts in the clean-up.

District project officers will lead the clean-ups in the districts."

If it explodes, the cost and the consequences can be very serious and uncontrollable. What oxygen is to lungs, welfare politics is to general public!

Jammu Kashmir lags behind in giving gainful employment to the educated youth because the state lacks a handsome and healthy private sector which could employ the youth and as such play a role as an employment agency.

The state's colleges and universities end up in producing an army of educated youth with degrees in academic subjects.

In the absence of an advanced private sector, the state employs the academic degree holders in majority in its Department of Education. This trend has increased post 1990s and predominantly after 2000 AD.

In keeping with that trend, about sixty thousand teachers were recruited at school level since year 2000 on the pattern of Rehaber-e-Taleem (ReT). These Ret teachers were categorized as Normal Rets (N-ReT) and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Rets (SSA-ReTs). Both the categories of ReTs were recruited through the similar codal norms set by the successive elected governments.

As per the norms, the two categories of ReT teachers were engaged for a monthly honorarium of RS 1500 to 3000 for five years and after the five year period were regularized as General Line Teachers in the then pay scale of school teachers.

For proof, the appointment orders, issued by the Directorates of School Education, can be examined.

Interestingly, the N-ReT category included 80 percent candidates who had passed the matric or the 12th standard and had given up further education. They were doing some other work.

However, the ReT type recruitment drive (done purely at the village/habitation level) made them Ret teachers. In the department, these ReTs went on achieving academic degrees and today they are degree holders. In a way, the Department of Education helped them get these degrees.

Among SSA Rets, seventy percent candidates were having high degrees such as B.Ed/M.ed and post-graduation at the time of their engagement as ReTs. They could have looked for highly paid jobs but the need of a means of livelihood forced them to accept the low paid ReT job. This job promised them job security and a life of happiness and dignity.

After their regularization as General Line Teachers, both the categories of Ret teachers have been given different incentives, allowances, annual increments and their service records have been well maintained like that of the other employees of the state.

However, the irony is that the SSA category of Rets has been excluded from the benefits of the 7th pay commission applied to all state employees, including the N-ReT teachers in April this year.

Neither a formal order has been issued to deny the pay commission benefits to the SSA- ReT teachers nor has an order been issued to give such benefits to them.

Such a situation has forced these 41 thousand SSA teachers to protest. But no response comes from the authorities.

As such, SSA teachers feel discriminated and marginalized. What pains them the most is that their non-SSA colleagues get more salaries than them although all of them work at the same schools for the same students for the same amount of time.

Besides, no 7th pay commission benefits have deprived the SSA-ReTs of the annual increment benefits and will exclude them of the other incentives as well. The pay anomaly will keep on rising with each passing six months.

The situation has created psychological trauma for SSA ReTs. They are state employees and SSA simply is a funding agency to the state. However, their salaries even as per the previous pay scale are not released for three to five months. It seems that these teachers are punished for somebody's political adventurism.

These teachers do not want confrontation with the state for their grave problems if the state gives them the commission benefits and releases their salaries each month.

The state should come clean on the future of SSA category of teachers. Wasting time has served no purpose.

If the state cannot treat them at par with the other employees of the state, then it should give back the crucial years of life to these teachers and compensate for the loss that these teachers had to suffer during their service to the state.

Besides, the state needs to explain the rationale behind keeping these teachers in dark at the time of their recruitment and also explain the present rationale of only depriving them of the service benefits.

Ignoring the plight of these teachers can prove costly. Who knows we may be sitting on a time bomb?"

Some protestors were bundled into Police vans after they tried to march on Residency Road, bringing the traffic to grinding halt for nearly twenty minutes. After stepping out of the Park, Police equipped with riot gear, stopped the protestors near General Post office and used water cannon and baton-charged the agitators to disperse them.

Earlier, under the banner of EJAC, a large number of employees from different districts assembled at Sher-e-Kashmir Park in Srinagar and held demonstration. They were holding placards inscribed with demands for delinking of their salaries from the Central Fund and implementation of 7th Pay Commission.

President EJAC, Qayoom Wani addressed the gathering and said that depriving 40,000 SSA teachers from the benefit of 7th Pay Commission was unjust. He further said that because of delay in de-linking their salary from the Central source of funding, these SSA teachers were not getting regular salary with the result that these employees were facing difficulty even to feed their families and deposit school fees of their wards.

Qayoom Wani threatened to hit roads along with five lack employees under the banner of EJAC, if authorities fail to fulfill their demands.

In Jammu, J&K ReT Teachers' Forum held a strong protest demonstration near Press Club Jammu, under the leadership of State president Vinod Sharma.

Holding placards in their hands and shouting slogans in favour of their demands, the protesting ReTs tried to take out a march towards Governor House but a large number of police personnel deployed there foiled the attempt. In the process, a few ReTs received minor injuries and some of them were even temporarily detained.

ReTs, who were detained, included Nazam Jafri, Sukhdev Singh Sumbria, Gulzabir Daing, Naresh Sharma, Rajesh Jamwal, Sham Sharma, Raj Kumar Dubey, Sukesh Khajuria, Mahesh Kumar, Arvind Sharma, Rinku Sharma, Sajad Malik, Lekh Raj Parihar and others.

Earlier, addressing the gathering, Vinod Sharma flayed the Government for its dilly delaying tactics to resolve the issues of SSA Teachers and Masters. He lamented that families of thousands of these teachers were suffering badly because of irregular salary.

""We have projected these issues from bottom to top and even many peaceful protests have been held in Jammu as well as Kashmir province but still these issues are unresolved, thereby forcing us to come on roads "" he said adding that they had no such attention to leave their schools and come on roads but callous approach of the Government was forcing them for such steps.

A similar but peaceful protest demonstration was held in the premises of Divisional Commissioner Jammu, under the banner of Employees Joint Action Committee, (EJAC) to draw the attention of Governor towards the plights of Regularized ReTs under the flagship schemes of SSA and RMSA.

The speakers highlighted the issues of ReTs and raised slogans in support of their demand for 7th Pay Commission benefits to the SSA teachers and delinking their salary from Central fund.

After the protest demonstration, Ganesh Khajuria, general secretary JKTF, a constituent of EJAS, along with Amrik Singh, N S Jamwal, Jagdish Sharma, Surinder Radotra, Janak Raj Choudhary, Lalit Pandita and Kuldeep Sharma of EJAC submitted a memorandum to the Governor through Divisional Commissioner Jammu urging him to intervene and streamline the salary issue by delinking it from the MHRD budget besides extending the benefits of 7th Pay Commission in their favour."

The issue came up for discussion during a meeting of JKGTF held here under the chairmanship of Amar Nath Thakur. The meeting discussed the issue of non implementation of 7th PC by adopting a discriminatory, unconstitutional approach in favour of SSA and RMSA teachers.

Speaking on the occasion, Amar Nath Thakur, Chairman of JKGTF, said that in SRO there is no mention about the non implementation of the 7th PC to a section of teachers of the State working under RMSA and SSA. Therefore it is obligatory on the part of State Government to implement the 7th PC to all Government employees of J&K.

Addressing the meeting, Parveen Singh, State general secretary of the Forum, stated that no stone would be left unturned in getting the 7th PC implementation in favour of RMSA and SSA teachers. He appealed Governor NN Vohra to clear all the pending liabilities of teachers. He further added that most of the Masters and Head Master working under RMSA and SSA are at the edge of retirement and their pension cases cannot be settled if 7th PC is not implemented in their favour.

All the speakers expressed hope that State administration council under NN Vohra would consider the implementation of 7th PC recommendations in favour of SSA and RMSA teachers."

The District Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has launched a scheme to provide on-site support by a team of trainers to schools.

Usually, one or two trainers from the block resource centres would visit schools to provide them various kinds of support.

To make this initiative more effective, the district SSA has formed entire groups called Team On-Site Support (OSS) to support schools in academic and other activities.

These teams of 10 to 12 members will visit one school in each panchayat and interact with school authorities and students over a couple of days to understand the functioning of the schools so as to make effective interventions, be it in studies, or functioning of class libraries and biodiversity parks. Once the needs are identified, the team will draw up plans on the activities to be taken up and help teachers to implement them. The panchayat education committee will be briefed on the activities taken up in schools, said District SSA Project Officer B. Sreekumaran.

The teams will be led by the block programme officer and comprise trainers and special coordinators.

The teams will later be split into two to cover more panchayats. Starting this month, the District SSA plans to cover one school in each panchayat by the middle of September, before starting the next round to reach out to more schools, he said.

Camps

The District SSA is also conducting camps for differently abled children to identify the equipment they need. Children from Classes 1 to 12 are attending the camps. Children whose equipment has run into trouble are also being covered.

After the camps conclude, a count will be taken of the total equipment needed in the district - be it the number of wheelchairs, or hearing aids, spectacles, or artificial leg. After this, e-tendering will be done to purchase the equipment. The district purchase committee will open the e-tenders and award the work."

Under the banner Jammu and Kashmir Teachers Joint Action committee, hundreds of teachers from different districts protested at Sher-e-Kashmir Park here today. They were holding placards inscribed with demands for the delinking of their salaries from the Central Fund and implementation of 7th Pay Commission.

They said that families of over 40,000 teachers were suffering mental trauma due to non-implementation of 7th Pay Commission, and failure of Government to streamline their salaries.

We can wait two-three months for the delinking of salaries but would not compromise on the implementation of 7th Pay Commission"", president employees Joint Action Committee, Qayoom Wani said, adding government has been indifferent towards the demands of the teachers.

He said from March 2017, the teachers have been protesting for their demands but authorities have failed to act. ""The Governments in the past made three committees to look into the matter but to no avail,"" he said.

Wani said that the issue was also raised with Governor, N N Vohra. ""The Governor forwarded cases to the departments of Finance and Education who failed to do anything,"" he said. ""We want the Governor to personally look into the matter"", they added.

Several protestors were bundled into police vans outside the Sher-e-Kashmir Park. After stepping out of the park the police, equipped with riot gear, stopped and used water cannon to disperse them. Scenes of teachers being hit with batons and thrown by the shooting of high-velocity stream of water from cannons were also witnessed.

They said that there are nearly 50, 000 SSA teachers working with the education department. ""Almost 50% of the staff of primary and middle schools is SSA teachers.

Our Correspondent

Kohima, June 8 (EMN): The Nagaland government has admitted to committing mistakes in appointing teachers, even as the 2010 and 2013 batches of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan teachers are currently on protest. The 2010 and 2013 batch teachers are protesting under the aegis the Nagaland State Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers Association (NASSATA). The sit-in protest entered its third day on Friday in Kohima.

The SSA teachers were recruited for a centrally sponsored scheme, a flagship programme of the union Ministry of Human Resource Development, and are bound by terms and conditions of the programme where their services are to be terminated with the closure of the programme.

During a press conference that was held on Friday afternoon, Chief Secretary Temjen Toy said, ""I must admit that there have been shortcomings on the part of the government, because they were supposed to be appointed against the programme and with the terms and conditions. But then, at that particular point of time, out of oversight or out of whatever reasons the appointments that were given to them were given in the form of any regular appointment. That is one shortcoming we have to admit and call 'spade a spade'. That is the mistake the government made.""

The administrator likened the government's position to being trapped 'between the devil and the deep blue sea.' According to him although the appointments were intended in accordance with the programme's guidelines, the manner in which they were made were not 'proper.'

""So now, we are struggling with that and the Finance department and the School Education department have been struggling to find a solution,"" Toy admitted. He asserted that 'some solution' must have to be arrived at to settle the matter. He said that once the 'initial mess' concerning the appointments is sorted out, 'everything will come into place.'

While acknowledging the problems faced by the SSA teachers, Toy also pointed that on several occasions the government, despite its 'tight resource position,' had 'advanced salaries just to tide over their immediate difficulties.'

On the demand of the association for 7th ROP, Toy reiterated that the government has agreed in principle to revise their salaries. He reminded that the government has to follow certain procedures; clearances have to be obtained and calculations have to be made which is why it is going to take time for implementation. Stating 'full commitment' to finding solutions to whatever problems 'we' are facing in any of the sectors, specifically the SSA, the officer said that the association has to give time to the government to examine the matter.

'Know your place'

All said, Toy bluntly termed the second demand of the association -- transferring their salaries from Plan to Non-Plan -- 'infantile and none of their business to tell the government that our salaries should come from this or that.'

Justifying his use of the language, he said 'Today the term 'Plan and Non-Plan' doesn't exist in government. We don't use those terms anymore. So it is not for any association or group to tell the government that we want our salaries from this and that.'

Toy asserted that 'so far as the government is concerned their salaries come from the flagship programme, but because of the problems in their appointments, some way out has to be found out.'

The SSA teachers have refused to accept their salaries from January-March that have been released already. The association is demanding that it should be released with the 7th ROP entitlement.

Toy maintained that the first demand need to be sorted out. He pointed out that the government was not flush with money. Even if it were so, he said such things take time and requires 'calculated steps to be taken by the government.'

Appeal to call off agitation

The government has appealed to the teachers to end their protest. Pointing out that the future of the children was being held to ransom, Toy expressed regret that 'a group of enlightened and educated persons are behaving in this way.'

""I regret that such demands are being made by the association comprising of qualified education providers, one doesn't expect their maturity to be of this level,"" Toy stated. ""I am sounding harsh but we know our business. We cannot compromise the education of our children.""

The officer maintained that the government will be the first to admit shortcomings on its part and take corrective measures. However, he reminded that just because a section of the government employees would have demands does not mean every demand is justified.

Toy strongly asserted that ""even if they go agitating, the stand of the government is not going to change. We have made our commitment and our commitment stands. It is only a matter a time as there are certain preparations that have to be made and the exercise is going on.""

Reminding the teachers about their responsibilities over students, he assured that the government had been looking into their grievances 'despite the agitation and not because of the agitation.'

Beyond this, he maintained firmly, the government cannot do anything 'agitation or no agitation.' However, he cautioned that if the association still insists on agitating then the government will have to take action according to stipulated procedures and existing laws as the government cannot afford to compromise with the future of the students.

Another officer, Principal Secretary Menukhol John, observed a 'trust deficit' between the government and the association. He has asked the association to give the government time to work on the issue.

Meanwhile, the president of the NASSATA, Penthungo Yanthan, has informed that the teachers will continue with their sit-in protest on June 11 at the Secretariat. He said that while the group 'understands' the problems of the government, the teachers want a written assurance as they were ready to give time to the government to resolve the issue."

It is not first time that conflict between Government and SSA teachers in J&K has come into limelight, infact, more or less it is a routine phenomenon since last many years but successive State Governments have given only empty assurances on the name of finding an everlasting solution of this problem.

It is pertinent to mention that these forty thousand plus SSA teachers who constitutes the bulk of teaching fraternity of School Education Department in J&K have played a very crucial role in reviving and rebuilding educational infrastructure which was badly affected during last two decades due to unrest and tumultuous atmosphere in the state. It is well known to everyone that these SSA teachers, majority among them highly qualified were initially appointed on pattern of Rehbar-e-Taleem who served in the department for first five years merely on a very meager salary of Rs 1500 and Rs 3000 on the assurance of the Government that they will get a handful salary regularly after regularisation of their services but it is again an irony that after completion of five years, situation turned worse due to inconsistent and irregular release of SSA salaries. Now it has become a trend that SSA teachers in our State remain without salaries for months together and only after protests, agitations and lockouts their salaries of merely a month or two are credited into their accounts while for several other months remains liability which creates sense of insecurity among the SSA teachers and it is a fact that feeling of insecurity is always inimical to sense of wellbeing, as it causes anxiety and stress which in return harms physical and mental health of these thousands of SSA teachers.

Irregularities and delay in the salary of SSA teachers is not a matter of concern only for themselves, more importantly it is adversely affecting their status as they find it difficult to even satisfy their day to day domestic and social responsibilities due to unavailability of sufficient financial resources. In the absence of salaries they are finding it hard to fulfill very basic needs of their families. Many old and ailing parents of these SSA teachers helplessly wait for the release of salaries of their offsprings so that they may have access to proper treatment for their ailments. Not only this in this era of high inflation SSA teachers face difficulties in satisfying basic needs of their Children due to dry pockets. There is no wrong in saying that prevailing situation has made thousands of SSA teachers and their family members in Jammu and Kashmir so helpless that they find themselves almost on the verge of starvation.

It is matter of serious concern why thousands of SSA teachers who are performing their duties with full dedication and honesty even in remotest areas are not getting their salaries on time ? Although apart from teaching assignments these SSA Teachers are also performing various other duties of National and State interest every now and then. State Government is also using them for different special duties including election duties, census duties, survey duties and many a time even to make Flagship programs like Swachh Bharat Abhiyan successful and popular but in spite of all these neither State nor union Government has taken cognizance of their genuine grievance related to irregularities in disbursement of their salaries.

It is only due to apathetic approach of the Government that these SSA teachers have to very often protested from streets to Secretariat for getting their hard earned money and in this process many a time these teachers had to face harsh treatments like lathicharge and from police in response to peaceful protests in favour of their salary issue. Although peaceful protests and agitations are part and parcel of a democratic set up but it is duty of Government to timely address the issues raised thereof and solve the same in order to avoid their reoccurrence. But in case of salary issue of SSA teachers in Jammu and Kashmir everytime Government has only tried to pacify the SSA teachers rather than working out a permanent solution of the problem.

Now time has come that Government should alter its approach, amd it is need of the hour to workout a constructive mechanism to abolish irregularities in paying salaries to more than forty thousand SSA Teachers in Jammu and Kashmir. It is very much expected that the State Government will now take appropriate action to solve this long pending but very genuine SSA salary issue once for all and once for ever.

Last but not the least one and only panacea of this whole problem lies in streamlining of SSA teachers salary by de-linking it from Central source of funding and release of the same from State budget. It is firmly believed that once salary of these teachers is credited into their Bank Accounts without any delay. This in return will boost the confidence of teachers and they will work with extra amount of zeal and zest which is beneficial not only for more than forty thousand SSA teachers but also for lacs of students studying in Government schools of Jammu and Kashmir.

According to the union, a rough survey shows that this academic year for the innocent students studying in government schools has been severely affected. It was stated that the first terminal examination has not been conducted till now.

The MTLT questioned the state government, particularly the department of School Education 'whether their conscious allows them to gamble with the lives and educational careers of the thousands of students studying in the government schools.'

The union pointed out that government schools remain the only hope for education for thousands of students in Nagaland.

With the appointment of 'well-qualified' teachers through the SSA (centrally sponsored scheme), the quality of education had witnessed a steady improvement, under Mokokchung town area, the union stated.

The union said the agitations in the education department are seriously undermining the academic careers of the students.

It also questioned whether the DoSE will take the responsibility if the academic session for this year is not completed because of the ongoing agitations.

They said that SSA teachers have not received salary for the past three-four months. ""Government is playing with the future of thousands of SSA teachers who are without any salary for last three months. This delay has badly affected our families"", a protester said.

Several protesters were bundled into police vans near Pratap Park here after they tried to march towards Residency Road, bringing the traffic to grinding halt for nearly half an hour. After stepping out of the park the police, equipped with riot gear, stopped the protestors outside the Press Enclave here, used water cannon and baton-charged the agitators to disperse them. Scenes of teachers being hit with batons and high-velocity water from water cannons were also witnessed.

Participants of the rally, who gathered outside the Pratap Park, alleged police of using force against the protestors. ""We were protesting peacefully but the police used force and did not allow us to hold a peaceful march"", a protester said.

The protesters said that they have been demanding to streamline their salaries for last several years but to no avail.

They said that there were nearly 50, 000 SSA teachers working with the Education Department. ""Almost 50% of the staff of Primary and Middle Schools is working under SSA.
