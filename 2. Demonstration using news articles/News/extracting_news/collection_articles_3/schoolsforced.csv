According to the report, none of the schools had female security guards, many students are yet to receive stationery money. Only 62 schools, of total 344, have CCTV cameras installed in them.

In almost 14 schools, more than 5,000 students are forced to sit on floors, as there are no desks and benches, and around 44 schools do not have Jal Board's water connections.

As per the report, a press statement released by SDMC in June stated that within four months, 4,348 CCTV cameras will be installed in 344 primary schools.

AAP councilor from Sitapur, Praveen Kumar Praveen Kumar, raised questions about the predicament of the schools in the meeting and accused the ruling BJP of making tall promises but failing to execute them.

Nandini Sharma, the South Corporation Education committee chairperson, said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited, and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

She cited lack of funding as the reason for the woes of school and said, ""We received Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as a subsidy for uniforms""."

This has forced schools to depend on their managements which has resulted in appointment of temporary teachers on contract basis, accept donations and increase the tuition fees.

School authorities are facing difficulties in managing on daily basis due to lack of funds. The state funds help schools to pay salaries of the teachers and maintenance of school building, conduct repair, help pay electricity and water bills, stationery, purchase furniture and facilitate administrative work. In addition, in the funds given by the state, schools can conduct extra activities and manage new boards or curriculum.

A principal of a Bandra school said, ""We have been asking our management to give us more finance just to pay basic electricity and maintenance bills. The management in turn gets this money through donations and well-wishers or senior alumnus members. Nobody wants to talk about these issues openly, as ultimately we are government-aided schools and do not want our children to suffer, or be forced to shut down our schools.""

The state recently declared it will fill all vacant posts of teachers in junior colleges, but principals have questioned when does the state plan filling vacant posts in schools and tackling the phenomenon of temporary teachers. Shubhdha Gorge, a teacher of St Thomas High School, said, ""We are being hired on contract basis for a temporary period. The school does not have the ability to hire us as permanent staff, because they do not have sufficient funds to pay our salaries. How long can we work as temporary staff for a minimal salary?""

One fall out of this financial crunch is, school authorities are forced to increase tuition fees. A principal of Andheri School, said, ""We are left with no option but to increase the fees of students to pay the bills and keep our school running. Then we have the Fee Regulation Authority (FRA), which enforces its rules on us and keeps a tab. This leaves us in a fix and we do not know what to do."" Principals of various schools have written to state education department to resolve this issue of lack of funding."

Addressing legislators during the discussion on demand for grants for the education department, Parrikar said that once the neighbourhood school concept was properly implemented, ""no school will shut down and no case of denied admission will be found"".

Parrikar justified his decision by saying that there were sufficient educational institutions in the state to cater to all areas. He claimed that ""Goa is a saturated state with respect to schools"".

""I will not permit new schools to open... So the question of medium of instruction is not a serious problem. Around 2-3 schools have been given permission but those are in Konkani and Marathi and because there were no schools in a 2-3km radius in those locations. Today, one can find schools within 1-2 km,"" he said.

The minister said that schools would have to abide with the neighbourhood school concept as it would be one of the conditions for grant-in-aid from the government.

He said some relaxations would be made for parents who want to admit their children to a school where an elder sibling is already studying. ""If a sibling or if the parent has studied in a particular school, the school will have a quota for such admissions,"" Parrikar said.

He said that norms surrounding the implementation of the concept would be made ""clear before the next academic year starts"". He added, ""We will be forceful. Only for higher secondary, the range will be bigger.""

The education minister also said that the Goa State Infrastructure Development Corporation (GSIDC) was in the process of developing a mobile app that would allow teachers in government schools to inform the government if any school equipment was broken or in need of maintenance."

This is the situation in most government schools of the city. In many schools even basic facilities are not available for the children.

Key amenities and infrastructure are found missing or in a shoddy condition in many government and private schools across the city. Many of the schools have unusable toilets or the facilities are in poor condition, many others have no playgrounds or boundary walls.

Every time we need to use the washroom, we have to go home, says 10-year-old Rekha who studies at a government school in the city. Her school doesn't have a playground, drinking water facilities or a boundary wall.

Many feel there is a direct correlation between sanitation facilities and the retention of girls in schools. Parents don't want their children to go to schools like these.

In 2010, the Centre gave states three years to ensure that basic infrastructure requirements were put in place.

Shortage of infrastructure in schools in the city is a major challenge and there is no drinking water facility in many government and private schools. Several schools have no toilets, even for girl students.

Implementation of Right to Education Act for compulsory and free education to children is also another major challenge."

The numbers have almost halved in the past five years with educational institutions shying away from buying and registering new vehicles to transport students.

Attributing the drop in new buses to a lack of interest from parents, R Vishalakshi, president of the Tamil Nadu Private Matriculation Schools Association, said parents expect school buses to halt at their doorstep. School buses usually take a roundabout route whereas private vehicles pick up and drop students at their doorsteps, she said. ""This is why parents prefer private vehicles though they are expensive. We need to buy small buses to meet this demand but adding new vehicles to the existing fleet is not viable,"" she said.

Usually, schools collect Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000 as transportation fee per annum from students. The amount is no big deal for an institution which collects Rs 70,000 to Rs 1,50,000 as tuition fees. ""Why take the risk for such a small amount?"" said the principal of a city-based CBSE school.

With schools cutting down bus fleets, parents are forced to depend on private modes of transport that are unregulated and often unsafe to send their children school. Recalling an incident when an LKG girl was kidnapped by a private cab driver at R A Puram in 2013, S Arumainathan, state president of the Tamil Nadu Students Parents Welfare Association, said either the police or the transport department should create new rules to regulate vehicles transporting school children.

""The schools have absolved themselves of the responsibility to transport students. But they should note down the name of the private transporter to ensure safety of their students,"" Arumainathan said.

An auto or cab driver earns Rs 3,000 to Rs 8,000 per month by ferrying students every day. But for that he has to overload the vehicle. The traffic police have booked thousands of cases against private vehicles for such offences.

""It is not profitable if we transport three or four school children per trip. Only by accommodating at least eight students we will be able to compensate for the drop in revenue through regular trips because of increased fuel prices and app-based taxis,"" said V Chandran from the auto-drivers union of CITU in Chennai. Chandran said the driver usually resides in the same area from where he picks up and drops the students. He wins the trust of the parents for two reasons -- they know him personally and he gives individual attention to the children. If the classes are delayed, an autodriver waits and brings them back home, said Chandran.

Private schools have often cited strict design norms for buses -- mandated for safety of the students and hence demanded by transport department inspectors -- push up costs. But rejecting such claims, a transport official said schools need not alter buses to meet safety standards as manufacturers have started to produce models which meet the standards.

""Though the rejection rate due to defects in floor boards, doors and steps is high at first round of inspection, almost all vehicles make necessary corrections and start operation in the month of July or August,"" an official said.

Inspection for the forthcoming academic year is due next week."
