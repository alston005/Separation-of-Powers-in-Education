However, Department of Schools Education, Kashmir (DSEK) has given allowance to some private schools for only remedial classes that even on terms and conditions.

A number of parents said that there are several private schools that are giving winter tutorials to the students in the early morning.

Parents while questioning the government order regarding the winter vacations said, ""If the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) has announced the winter vacation in all schools so that the students will evade the biting cold and when it is not being implemented on ground level then what is the fun of announcing such vacations.""

One of the parents wishing anonymity said that there are some private schools that function for winter schooling, where classes start from 10 Am upto 2 PM.

He said, ""This freezing winter has returned after many years and the students are being compelled to attend the winter schooling starting from 10 Am.""

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

Another parent while lamenting on the issue said that her ward felt ill twice due the cold and he is not able to go for winter schooling in the misty morning.

Director Education, Kashmir, Ghulam Nabi Itoo, said that the department had already issued the circular regarding the functioning of the winter schooling in the valley.

He said, ""We have only allowed private schools for only remedial classes and we have asked the concerned authorities to make proper arrangements of heating and seating available."" ""The scheduled timing for the approved private schools and the coaching centres is from 11 AM to 3 PM,"" he said."

(HT File)

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there. They think their kids will only be able to adjust in special schools. More efforts need to be put in to make campuses more inclusive by appointing trained special educators and providing better infrastructure facilities,"" said Dr Satender Singh, disability rights activist."

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards.

As per media reports, several schools are insisting parents to submit their Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admissions.

Speaking about the same with news agency PTI, UIDAI chief Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said that the department is aware about the fact that some private schools are demanding Aadhaar cards for admission of students. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey told the news agency.

The UIDAI has also warned the school administration to make sure that none of the students are denied admission for not providing Aadhaar as admission document. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" Pandey said.

The Supreme Court, in September this year, upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and stated that it would remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN). However, the top court also mentioned that the 12-digital unique identification number will not be mandatory for opening bank accounts, mobile connections and school admissions.

The apex court's directive also stated that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

An endless debate rages in the education sector over whether school education ought to be run solely by the state or allowed to move into private hands.

Though a host of individuals, experts and organisations strongly favour a state-run education system, the fact is that state schools all over the world, including India, have witnessed a steady outflow of children to the private school system. ""Parents are voting with their feet. The private education sector exists for a reason and we have to stop pretending that it doesn't,"" says Aashti Zaidi Hai, director of the ..."

Apparently, the poor didn't know the value of education and used their children as labour.

This debate should have died after the 1991 liberalisation when poor parents woke up and became eager to send their children to English medium schools. Was this treated as good news? Not really, for the elites found something else to complain about.

The poor wanted schools, but couldn't find any. Many primary schools that had supposedly been ""built"" by government in remote villages simply didn't exist: that money had long evaporated through corruption. Where the poor did have a local primary school, it was dilapidated and its appointed teachers didn't even come to the school. And in the few cases where the teachers did come, the parents found the teachers to be hopelessly incompetent. Not a surprise since most of them have bribed their way into the job.

And so, as Gurcharan Das has said, India grows at night. Where the government fails, private enterprise steps in to retrieve the situation and bring in a modicum of development. That's what happened in the school sector. To meet this huge demand, private for-profit low-cost schools sprung up like mushrooms. These were not perfect by any stretch of imagination but they were vastly superior to the non-existent or even the average government ""school"", as Tooley's diligent research has shown.

When this happened, the elites moved their goalpost and started complaining against these private schools. Anurag Behar's recent article in Live Mint is a case in point. No matter the poor do, India's elites will always find something wrong with them.

The elites are now demanding a huge increase in government management and funding in the school sector. Apparently, it was not enough for the government to have failed totally and comprehensively for 70 years. Our only saviour is our government once again, headed by criminals who appoint teachers through bribes and who pocket the taxes allocated for school infrastructure. According to our elites, the private sector is nothing but a pain in the neck and must be sidelined.

In my view there are two explanations for this inexplicable view by people like Mr Behar. Either these elites are grossly ill-informed or they have a hidden agenda. Is it possible that not being capable of delivering better low-cost schools that poor parents will pay for, in the face of cut-throat competition, elite NGOs are bagging their competition in order to grab government subsidies?

But let me take a more charitable perspective, which turns out to be possibly worse in some ways. I suspect the real explanation is that these elites have a strong ideological belief in socialism which has made them blind to the blatant crimes and corruption of government, even where the evidence is right in front of their nose.

In India we pay twice for everything: first we pay the government, and then, after it has failed, we pay a second time, to the private sector, to finally get the job done, with whatever money we still have left in our pocket.

The elites must surely realise that nothing concentrates the mind more than poverty. Even the slightest expenditure the poor make must pass the most stringent tests. That poor parents are choosing to pay twice for their children's education tells that something is seriously wrong with the government system. To suggest that such poor people are stupid and gullible is to discount what they are trying to tell us: Stop looting us and let us free.

We know from Tooley's research (and I have some personal direct evidence that I'll mention some other day in another context) that these parents are actively monitoring the performance of their children. And to ensure that these parents' don't move their child to another school, the school owners are constantly monitoring the performance of the teachers. The incentives align perfectly.

Of course, these schools have poor infrastructure - but that's all the poor can pay for. This, however, is not the pivotal issue. Gandhi rightly told us that it is not school infrastructure but the teacher that matters most. We need teachers who actually come to teach. And second, that these teachers are at least moderately competent.

It is unfortunate that an institution named after one of India's greatest entrepreneurs, Aziz Premji, has such a dim view about perhaps the greatest example of entrepreneurship in the world - the low cost for-profit private schools of India.

Good policy can't be made by assuming a role for government. It must begin by understanding any market failure and doing the best to support the market to overcome any such failure. Today there is a real market in school education in India with very little market failure. All we need is to support these schools through school vouchers for the poorest of the poor. Indeed, that's our party's policy.

One last point. Mr Behar points out that teachers in such schools are paid below the minimum wage. Our party rejects the very concept of minimum wage which is both theoretically and practically proven to harm the poorest of the poor. Our party will abolish minimum wage laws. Instead of seeing this as a problem, I suggest that Mr Behar celebrate the vast employment that these schools have generated and how well they are serving a genuine need to the best of their ability - despite total government antipathy.

It is not that these teachers are underpaid. Instead, teachers in government schools are grossly overpaid. In a private competitive system, teachers would all receive their marginal product. Better teachers would be paid vastly more than any teacher is paid today."

A division bench comprising Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the interim reprieve to private educational institutions, on a plea moved by All India Private Educational Institutions Association assailing the amendment dated January 25.

According to the petitioner, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act and the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act provided exemption from payment of property tax to educational institutions in the state.

The state government brought in certain amendments to these Acts to remove the exemption provided to the institutions and empowering the authorities to levy property tax for the properties owned by the institutions. After the amendment, only government run educational institutions would get the exemption, the petitioner said.

The move was immediately challenged by the association in the high court. The high court dismissed the plea holding that the government has power to cancel exemption granted to educational institutions.

This is in violation with the policy on Karnataka Educational Institutions (Regulation of Certain Fees and Donations) (Amendment) Rules 2018, which has been in force mandating the schools to stick to the calendar of events released by the Department of Public Instruction for admission.

The issue has gone viral on social media platforms, where parents have formed groups alleging that schools are charging up to '1,000 as fee per application form without confirming a seat.

This reporter from The New Indian Express visited some schools on Friday posing as a parent seeking admission and was shocked to learn that some schools have even closed the admission process for the next academic year.

Authorities of one such school located in South Bengaluru, offering both CBSE and ICSE syllabus, said, ""You are too late. We have already finished issuing applications for the next academic year and seats will also be announced soon.""

Another prime school, also located in Bengaluru South, issued the application form, but said they cannot assure a seat as they have already received application forms in excess of the seats available. ""We cannot assure you the seat. We are already flooded with applications. You will have to try your luck. If someone surrenders their seat, you may get a chance,"" said a front office staff member.

So blatant is this malpractice in the background of the sheer lack of regulation or enforcement of rules that some schools have even dared to publish their commencement of admission process for academic year 2019-20 on their official websites without fear of reprisals.

Shilpa Prashanth, a South Bengaluru parent said, ""I was looking for admission of my son at one of the prime schools in our locality, but I was surprised to hear that I was too late. Although I approached them in mid-October, the school had already closed the admission process.""

Another parent said, ""I took applications for my son from three main schools in West Bengaluru, but of the three, one school said they cannot promise a seat, while another demanded full payment of fees up front, now itself. So, I have decided to wait for communication from the third school.""

Moreover, some of the schools which are confirming the seats while collecting advance fees to block the seats, are refraining from giving a receipt to the parents in return for the payment. ""We have to agree at the risk of losing the amount as the schools are not giving receipts. But, as it is hard to get seats in these schools, we are being forced to agree and accept whatever the conditions laid down by the schools,"" said one desperate parent.

Paying heavy price for education

Scared to file plaint

Although the District Education Regulatory Authority (DERA) is active, parents do not dare to file complaints as they are worried that such an act would affect their child's prospects in getting a seat

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

While addressing a press conference here today, they alleged that over the last few weeks there has been a sustained effort to undermine the private education sector in Kashmir, which has created a dangerous situation for the entire society.

The Association while condemning the move said that the certain lobby in administration and few other quarters who in one way or other are trying to destroy the fledgling private education sector in Kashmir.

G N Var, chairman PSAJK said that Legal Metrology Department, Directorate of School Education, Fee Fixation Committee, district administration and everybody who wields some sort of power are swooping down on small private schools to harass them. In the name of selling books, schools are being targeted unnecessarily.

""Today running a private school has become a herculean task. With mudslinging, barrage of allegations and character assassinations, private schools are being labelled as some kind of criminals,"" he said.

War said incidentally, there is no rule which specifically says that schools cannot keep books in their schools for sale. In fact in February this year, High Court in New Delhi had allowed the sale of books, uniforms in schools at the tuck shops set up at affiliated schools across the country, holding that the sale of such items does not amount to ""commercialization"" of education.

""If the Government was sincere about selling of books in private schools, why didn't they take up the issue when the big schools like Missionary Schools sold every book, notebook and stationery items from their schools? Where were they when these schools forced parents to buy everything from their schools? This has been their practice for more than 20 years, yet they were never raided. It was only when the admission time in local private schools came, the Government suddenly wakes up. Two respected private schools like Green Valley and R P School were given harsh punishment even as no hand was laid on Missionary Schools despite later being way too costly,"" he said.

""In an ideal situation, the Government should have emulated the private school model and revolutionized the education sector. They could have provided the best education to the lowest of strata using our model but what they are doing is to destroy the only successful model of education in Kashmir. This shows their intent,"" he said."

CBSE had asked all affiliated schools to upload transfer certificates (TC) issued to students after completion of Std IX or XI, but almost all private schools have continued to ignore the diktat. The 2014 decision was taken so that students seeking admission to Std X or XII do not face delays just because their TC from previous school could not be verified. It was in the same year that CBSE's rule of counter-signature of TCs from school to the other was scrapped.

CBSE wrote to schools a few weeks ago saying that many schools are not following the rule even though it is mandatory. It added that students are facing unnecessary delays in admissions because of this. In the post-2014 scenario, CBSE simplified the Std X and XII admission process by asking the new schools to simply verify the student's TC from his previous school's web site and complete the admission formalities. But with private schools ignoring the rule, the paperwork for student increases and it delays admission in the new school.

Even though this practice is mandatory, none of the Nagpur-based private schools, whose websites were checked by TOI, had uploaded details of the TC. They didn't even give any tab on website mentioning that no TCs were taken. Government controlled Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) have a separate tab on their website which gives details of TCs issued in the current academic year. While KVs have been a step ahead of their private counterparts in implementing the rule, they still have not complied fully with CBSE's diktat, though the details they mention contain all required information.

CBSE's rule is very clear. It says that a scanned copy of the TC has to be uploaded on the school's website.

Advisor to the governor Khurshid Ahmed Ganai has issued directions to the directors of the School Education, Kashmir and Jammu, to immediately examine the complaints about sale of textbooks at exorbitant prices by private schools in the state and recommend measures to regulate the rates, an official spokesman said.

It is now a well-known fact that many schools force parents to buy books and uniforms only from a particular shop. This way they earn some extra money from the sale of the books and uniforms which in turn are sold to parents at an exorbitant cost. A prominent missionary school in Baramulla was recently fined for selling textbooks through a single bookshop only. But the menace is not confined to a single school only. Many elite schools in the Valley themselves sell these books but no action has so far been taken against them. It is thus necessary that the action against schools shouldn't be initiated on a selective basis.

Also, forays into commercial activities isn't only thing that is wrong with the private schools: their arbitrary fee structure and for that matter the quality of their teaching itself is a great cause of concern. What is needed, therefore, is not only the regulation of their commercial activities and the fee structure but a comprehensive look at the whole system of private schooling in the state. The objective should not be more regulation of these schools but to ensure that they deliver quality education for which they charge heavily. Kashmir has witnessed an unprecedented growth of private schools and most of these lack infrastructure and adequately qualified staff. And even with schools which have the infrastructure, the quality of education is pits.

Private schools have tried to act as more disciplined and rigorous academic counterparts of the Government schools: regular class work, less holidays and more extra-curricular activities have been their hallmark. But so far as quality of education is concerned, there is little that sets them apart. They charge heavy fees from the parents and compensate it not by imparting good quality education but by showing off some style: bright uniforms and more extra-curricular activities. Education in these schools is about stage-management: loaded satchels, excessive homework and an endless supply of stationary which in turn is cleverly bound up with the business part of running a school.

The aspect of the school which gets least attention is the education, which in turn boils down to the recruitment of good teachers. The schools hire the disaffected educated youth who are willing to work for a pittance as a prelude to a much sought-after permanent government job. And most of them miserably lack the depth of knowledge to be good teachers. This malaise afflicts our educational system right through - from primary schools to the universities. Surprisingly, some of the franchise schools which have forayed into Valley in recent years are similarly afflicted: a large, imposing infrastructure but little depth in the all-important tuition part of their functioning. Even though, it is equally the job of parents to see that these schools provide the quality education they seek for their wards, government can help by forcing these institutions to pay well to the teachers which in turn will attract better talent."

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Nov. 3 : A legislator has noted reports that are implied to be practices of subtle discrimination in private institutions. Some of these include priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to 'weak' students; or schools asking parents to deposit money, which are not returned unless their wards improve in performance.

The advisor was addressing the 25th anniversary of the All Nagaland Private Schools Association, Dimapur unit (ANSPA) at the Dimapur District Sports Council which was packed with students, teachers, and guests on November 3 to celebrate the silver jubilee.

The advisor for School Education, K Tokugha Sukhalu, attended the occasion as its main guest. He said that the private schools were performing better than the government institutions in terms of discipline, culture and accountability. While Dimapur is comparatively better than the rest of the districts, he said, there is very less space for outdoor activities though. He said learning methods are changing and the ANSPA should be able to manage trained personnel so that children are equipped with proper skills. He appealed to the teachers to ensure that courses are completed in time and ensure children are taught properly.

However, the advisor pointed out some of negative reports that reportedly were doing the rounds with regard to private educational institutions. These reports included alleged priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to weak students; reputed schools asking parents to deposit money and unless the children improve, funds are reportedly not returned.

At these, he asked the teachers to be proud of their students no matter what 'background difference' there may be. One cannot compare students based on their educational backgrounds and ""you never know the brightest students may lose tomorrow,"" he said. Institutions should not be only for profit-making but to ensure that students are nurtured to be the leaders of future, he reminded.

Enrolment in private institutions is increasing whereas enrolment in government institutions is decreasing. So, the responsibility is huge for the ANSPA, Sukhalu remarked. He added that students are the future and urged the children to pledge to be the ""leaders of tomorrow.""

The director of the Central Board of School Education at Guwahati, KK choudhury, also addressed the event. He said that ""Nagaland is a big contributor to the literacy rate of the country with 80.11%.""

In this changing scenario, non-conventional subjects are getting importance and employment opportunities are being widened. Almost 90% of job opportunities are available in the unorganised sector, he said. The official encouraged the gathering to embrace technology and incorporate the knowledge in their field. Further, he said that the Northeast region contributes greatly to the cultural and natural resources of the country."

The list available with the state department of public instructions, provided by the Deputy Directors of Public Instructions (DDPI), indicates that over 50 private schools affiliated to various boards have violated the act and are not introducing Kannada as their first or second language.

Following the recommendations by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), the state government had decided to make Kannada a compulsory subject (first or second language) at all the schools functioning in the state, irrespective of the board they follow, and the same had been implemented from the academic year 2018-19. But, even six months after the commencement of the academic year, some schools have been found violating the rule.

When the state government took this decision, several private schools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE boards had raised an objection. But, later as it became a state policy, the schools were forced to implement it.

Recently, the Kannada Development Authority received complaints against some of the schools alleging that they were not following the said rule. Based on the complaints, KDA chairperson Prof SG Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the state department of primary and secondary education to submit a report.

""Following the letter received from the KDA chairperson, we have instructed our DDPIs to visit the schools across the state and submit a report about the alleged violation. For some of the districts, we have yet to get the report,"" said Basavaraja, director of primary education department.

He said the department would initiate an action against such schools soon by first issuing notices as per the process. ""Once we get the report from all the districts we will issue notices to school managements which are violating the Compulsory Kannada rule,"" Basavaraja said.

The KDA authorities, on their part, have directed the primary and secondary education department to initiate action to disaffiliate such schools. Prof Siddaramaiah said, ""I have written a letter to the education department about the violation of the act by some of the private schools and have asked them to submit action taken report. But till date we have not received a reply from them. The department must take measures immediately to disaffiliate such schools.""

However, the rule framed by the department has no provisions to disaffiliate violating schools. As per the rules, the department can only levy a penalty of '500 on such schools in the first year."

She said her excitement at her daughter getting enrolled in a private school in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar was short-lived as she was forced to then spend money on her books, uniform and stationery. ""My daughter was admitted to Anglo Indian Public School in Class 1, under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, this year.

The woman said she was concerned about paying for her daughter's winter uniform, which would cost at least Rs 3,000.

Officials at Anglo Indian Public School said they had been unable to provide free uniforms and stationery items because they had not yet received any funds from the government. Chander Singh, a spokesperson for the school, said: ""Last year too, we received only Rs 1,125 per student. How can this amount cover books, uniform and stationery items and examination fees?""

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25 % of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and first standard -- are to be reserved for children whose parents earn less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.

At present, the Delhi government is supposed to reimburse Rs 1,100 per student for uniforms and another Rs 2,200 for books, stationery, tuition and exam fees.

HT is in possession of at least 100 complaints, written by families who claim they have been deprived of the free study material and uniforms by private schools.

Debate over funds

In 2013, a group of private schools had moved the Delhi high court claiming that the amount paid by the state government per child was too low to meet all expenses. The court, in 2014, directed private schools to provide books, stationery items and uniforms to students under the EWS/DG categories, and said it was the responsibility of both the government and the schools to ensure free education to these students. The matter is still subjudice. Even as the Delhi high court issued as many as 46 reminders to private schools between April 2014 and September 2018 to provide the required materials, parents claim they have still not received anything.

Most of the private schools this correspondent contacted declined to comment, saying the matter was subjudice.

Kamal Gupta, counsellor, Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools in Delhi, a body representing 450 private schools said half the schools have not received any funds from the government.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's education department -- Directorate of Education (DoE) -- said it already provided funds to the private schools and was requesting the government for ""additional funds"" to meet the revised estimates. The government, this year, increased the reimbursement amount by Rs 600.

""Whatever demand is pending for this year will be fully met by end-November. However, the delayed release of funds cannot be the reason for private schools not giving books and uniforms to the students,"" he said. Goel said the DoE had also issued multiple notices to many schools and warned they would de-recognise them if they did not provide books and uniforms.

Parents bear costs

Another parent, requesting anonymity, said two of his children were not given uniforms by a private school in north Delhi. ""My children got admission in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category this year. The school had given them used books but not uniforms and stationery. I had to buy those myself,"" said the man, who works in a grocery shop and earns Rs 5,000 a month.

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

New Delhi: Amid numerous complaints that private schools charge exorbitant fees and additional expenses, the government is trying to make their functioning more transparent.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been tasked with making sure that private schools charge what they declare -- that there are no hidden costs in their fee structure, and they do not ask parents to buy uniforms, books and other things from the school.

All this is now part of CBSE's revised bylaws, and if schools don't adhere to these rules, they can be disaffiliated.

""Regarding fee, the bylaws clearly state that full fee should be disclosed and there should be no hidden costs,"" a senior CBSE official said.

""The bylaws clearly state that fee is to be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government and fee revision shall be subject to laws.""

There are 20,783 schools affiliated to CBSE in India and other countries, teaching over 1.9 crore students.

The board will also focus on mapping learning outcomes in schools, which means assessing the quality of learning among students.

Teams from CBSE will visit schools for surveys, and also rank them on other parameters. If any school is found lagging on any of the parameters set by the board, it can be disaffiliated for a minimum of six months.

""Inspection of schools will now be outcome-based and more academic and quality-oriented, rather than focussing only on school infrastructure,"" the CBSE official said.

""The inspection will focus on academic excellence and progress of students over time, innovations and quality of pedagogy, capacity of teachers and teacher training, inclusive practices in school, quality of co-scholastic activities, whether curricular load is as per norms, whether there is adequate focus on sports and games etc.

According to records of the Directorate of Education (DoE) , of the 48,122 seats reserved under the so-called economically weaker section or EWS category in private schools at the entry level, only 35,500 seats have been filled. And according to a recent report submitted by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to the DoE, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

The schools have given a variety of reasons for refusing admission: no vacancies; the school being too far from the home of the child seeking admission; or that even general category seats are yet to be filled. The sixth round of admissions is still underway.

In some cases, parents this correspondent interviewed alleged that private schools denied admission to their wards even after their names appeared in the selected lists. DoE's response to this is that many such families do not report for admission even after the names have come up in the draw of lots and the selected names are displayed on the DoE website. DoE, which comes under the state government's education department, releases the list of selected candidates.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said, ""All these seats are vacant in less popular schools. Parents are not interested in getting their kids enrolled there. We have issued multiple notices to the schools after receiving complaints from parents. We have also sent our officials in many schools for inspection and found that parents did not report there.""

One parent says he and his ward reported and were turned away. ""I have been making rounds to Panchsheel Public School in Badarpur since March for the admission of my six-year-old son. His name appeared for admission in Class I in the first list. However, we were told that there was no vacancy and we would be called by the school when all the general seats are filled. How can he be allotted a school where there are no vacancies?"" said Tasneem Ahmed, who works in a grocery shop. He has been applying to enrol his son in a private school under the EWS category for the last three years.

""He will exceed the age limit if he does not get admission this year,"" said Ahmed. Children over the age of six are not eligible for entry-level admission in the EWS category.

Officials at Panchsheel Public School said there are no seats on offer. ""We had only one vacancy for class I this year and we had informed the DoE about it. We do not have any vacant seat,"" said Bharti Mehta, principal of the school.

Similarly, Shiv Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Mehrauli, said his four-year-old son was denied admission in Deep Public School in Vasant Kunj. ""I was not even given a proper reason for the denial. An official said that there was no vacancy,"" he claimed Officials at the school, however, denied the charges saying that all students whose names appeared in the list were given admission.

Still, there are some instances where the children have not reported for admission. This reporter met some families which did not report for admission to the schools. Many said the school was far from home. ""I stay in north Delhi's Samaipur Badli and my four-year-old was assigned three schools in Dwarka, which is at the distance of 20 km from our house. How can we enrol our little one there?"" asked Jyoti Kumari, a homemaker.

As per norms, children must be assigned schools within 3km range of their residence for entry level classes.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of seats are to be reserved for the EWS category in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools. Despite receiving over 100,000 applications every year, thousands of seats go vacant. As per the affidavits submitted by DoE in the Delhi high court, copies of which are with Hindustan Times, of 48,122 available EWS seats in private schools in Delhi, only 20,000 and 19,000 were filled in the last two academic sessions, 2017-18 and 2016-17, respectively.

DoE said it has set the target of filling at least 40,000 seats this year. ""We are yet to complete the final round of admission and hoping to fill over 40,000 seats this year,"" Goel said.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate in the Delhi high court said he has filed as many as 50 individual cases on behalf of the parents denied admission this academic session. ""This is a failure of DoE. Every year seats are going vacant and thousands of children are deprived of education in decent private schools. Strict actions need to taken against these schools rather than issuing circulars and notices.""

Experts working for the cause said that they have also approached to the Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia seeking his intervention. ""We have received innumerable complaints from parents who were denied admission by private schools to the education minister but to no avail. Hundreds of parents are still struggling to get their kids enrolled,"" said Ekramul Haque of NGO Mission Taleem.

Manish Sisodia did not respond to calls and messages despite repeated attempts."

'Fee fixation panel doesn't have adequate manpower to monitor thousands of schools'

Ahead of the new academic session, parents have expressed resentment against excessive tuition and admission fee charged by various private schools.

The parents have also accused Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) of not taking action against some schools despite repeated complaints. The allegations come in the wake of de-recognition of two private schools by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) for charging exorbitant fee.

Parents who have admitted their wards in Iqbal Memorial Institute (IMI) Bemina claimed that they had complained about the extra money charged by the school several times, but the Fee Fixation Committee didn't show any interest to address the issue.

""I admitted my son in the year 2015 and that time they charged me Rs 35,000 as admission fee. Presently the school is charging extra Rs 3900 as annual charges,"" said one of the parents wishing not to be identified.

""Earlier the school was charging Rs 2000 as monthly fee but after the FFC recommended them to charge just Rs 1890, the school adhered to the direction. Now again they are charging Rs 250 extra as computer fee and I am paying Rs 2150 a month including computer charges,"" he added.

Similarly, parents of those students who have admitted their kids in Kashmir Harvard Habak, complained that the school charged Rs 80,000 as admission fee besides charging Rs 3400 as monthly fee including transport charges.

One of the parents said that he admitted his daughter a few weeks late in the school and the authorities charged him extra money, saying that the school has increased the tuition fee.

""I am paying Rs 1500 for the 2nd standard student and more than Rs 1300 for 4th standard,"" he said.

Pertinently, the FFC has recommended Rs 1320 for 2nd standard.

Parents of those students, who have admitted their wards in Presentation Convent School, said they have paid Rs 70,000 as admission fee.

The parents also said that the tuition fee for a year is included in the admission fee.

According to one of the parents, who has admitted her ward in Presentation Convent Srinagar, in summers the school charges Rs 5090 as tuition fee for three months excluding transportation fee which is Rs 1500 per month.

""For winters the school is charging Rs 9120 tuition fee for three months which means we have are paying Rs 3040 per month excluding transportation charges,"" she said.

Similarly, as per sources Burn Hall School Srinagar also charges Rs 80,000 as admission fee.

""The admission fee is merely meant for the admissions; no tuition fee is included in admission fee.""

According to parents, the school charges Rs 2800 as monthly tuition fee in winters and over Rs 2600 in summers.

""In winters we are paying Rs 8,600 as tuition fee for three months excluding transport fee which is Rs 4800 and for the summers we are paying above Rs 8,000 excluding transport fee.""

According to the FFC, the school is supposed to charge Rs 1890 for first standard to 10th standard and Rs 2390 for 11th and 12th standard.

The FFC order (No 262-FFC of 2018 dated 21-02-2018) has clearly mentioned that the school shall not charge any other kind of fee unless a prior permission for the same is obtained.

Parents said Delhi Public School (DPS) Srinagar is charging Rs 1.10 lakh as admission fee.

One of the parents, Tahir Ahmad Dar (name changed) said his ward is studying in UKG and the school authorities are charging Rs 2750 as monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 monthly bus fee.

His two other kids are studying in 8th standard and 5th standard and he is paying Rs 4250 monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 bus fee for both classes.

According to FFC, the Linton Hall School in Rajbagh is supposed to charge Rs 1200 per month for the students of UKG to 10th standard as tuition fee.

However, top officials of FFC said they are they are charging Rs 1350 more as monthly tuition fee.

The FFC official said they have recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee for RP School, ""but they started charging Rs 1900 which also resulted in the suspension of its recognition"".

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora is charging Rs 83,000 as admission fee for the new entrants of nursery class and KG-I.

Sources told Rising Kashmir that the school has different charges for admission as the school is charging Rs 48,000 as admission fee for students getting admitted in 11th standard in which school is taking tuition fee from the admission fee for a year.

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora had been recommended Rs 2520 for KG-I, Rs 2140 for KG-II, Rs 1700 for the Ist class to 8th standard and Rs 1950 for the 9th and 10th standard.

For the 11th standard, the FFC allowed the school to charge Rs 3255 for medical students and Rs 3015 for Arts students and for 12th standard the school had been allowed to charge Rs 3580 for the medical students and Rs 3320 for Arts students.

The FFC official said the school was violating norms and will not reclaim recognition unless they adhere to its guidelines.

The parents of those wards who are studying in Foundation World School said they are being charged Rs 50,000 as admission fee.

Parent of one of the wards said, ""My kid is studying in the nursery class and I am paying Rs 8000 monthly fee including Rs 6000 tuition fee and Rs 2000 transport fee.""

Parents of those wards who are studying in GD Goenka Srinagar said the school charged Rs 1 lakh earlier for new admissions and Rs 7,000 as monthly fee including the bus charges.

Another parent whose two kids are studying in Biscoe School said he is paying Rs 2730 for 4th standard and Rs 2760 for 8th standard.

""Last year the admission fee was Rs 65,000 in which the school was offering one-year tuition fee and uniform charges as well. The school is giving proper receipt of admission fee which other private schools don't. They take fee draft,"" he said.

The Woodlands School Shivpora charges Rs 28,000 as admission fee for new entrants.

""They are charging Rs 3200 fee. The school charges transport fee according to the distance.""

Officials in FFC said they lack manpower and cannot monitor each and every private school.

""There are more than two thousand private schools in the valley and we don't have that much of manpower available with us. This committee was formed a few years back and it will take time to upgrade it,"" he said.

When contacted, the chairperson and officials of FFC did not respond to repeated calls and messages from this reporter.

Director School Education Kashmir, GN Itoo said the complaints against any school received by FFC are being taken seriously and necessary action will be taken immediately.

""Recently FFC has issued a circular in which they have asked all private schools to reveal their current fee structure, admission fee and transportation fee as well and once they will get the details from schools, it will be decided by DSEK as to what should be done with the violators,"" he said.

Itoo further said the FFC has sought help from DSEK also. ""And we have assured them that nodal officers from CEO office will help them at the district level.""

years of 2016-17 and 2017-18, an analysis has shown.

The analysis, commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), was carried out by Indus Action, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) working towards implementation of Section 12(1)(C) of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clause mandates that private, unaided schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats in entry-level classes for EWS/DG category students.

The data for the analysis was obtained from the Directorate of Education (DoE).

According to the report filed by the NGO, 48 private schools did not admit any student under the quota in 2016-17 while seven schools registered no admissions under the category in 2017-18. Additionally, about 19 private schools did not admit a single child in both years.

""One of the things asked by the DCPCR to the NGO was to analyse and list the schools who had not given admission to a single child under the quota despite allotment of the seats with them,"" member of DCPCR Anurag Kundu said.

The commission has asked for the phone number of parents allotted seats under the quota, along with reasons recorded by these schools for not admitting them from the DoE.

""All this has been requested to corroborate the claims, by both parents and the school... and to find what the truth is and then initiate an enquiry accordingly,"" Kundu added.

The DoE was not available for comment when approached by the Sunday Standard.

""Private schools are primarily are not interested in giving admissions to children belonging to the EWS and DG category. The improper monitoring by the education department has further given them

leverage to deny admission,"" said Advocate and social activist Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist which fights for people belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group.

""The purpose of carrying the analysis was to send show cause notice to such private schools. It appeared some of these schools in Delhi outrightly denied.

With passing years, the government taxes are only increasing in the valley. From eateries to earnings to the money people spend, everything comes with a tax. ""For what we have, we can pay the taxes. But for what we already spent, how can they ask for tax?"" asks a parent Tawheed Ahmad who recently got his kin admitted in a reputed private school in Srinagar.

After a baby is born, one looks at its face and thinks about the number of classes he/she has to study. People wait for the baby to start talking so that they can send them to a playschool where they can learn alphabets, rhymes, words, numbers, puzzles, games, colours and how to talk in English. This time is 'crucial' for the child as it will decide whether the child can get admitted in a reputed school or not.

""We tried to teach our child at home but in a play school, they learn discipline and exactly the things that will be asked in their interview,"" says Ahmad.

Ahmad had sent his ward to a playschool at the age of 3. ""He would still be sleeping when we would wake him up. He would cry a lot before leaving for the playschool. He would sleep for hours after coming back. This is the necessity of time,"" he explains adding that he had to pay around Rs. 2000 per month as the fees of the playschool for 2 years.

As soon as the news about the availability of school forms came, Ahmad and his wife like thousands of other parents in Kashmir ran to schools in the middle of the night, lining in a queue to grab a form.

""We went to many schools. I sent my brother to some places, me and my wife went to Tyndale Biscoe School. It was around 3 in the morning. There were already 3-4 parents waiting outside the school. We waited and waited. We had taken Namkeen Chai with us. We had breakfast on the road and finally the gate opened,"" he recalls.

After submitting the form, he says, the family would be after the child, asking him all sorts of questions like, ""What is your name, What is your father's name? What is your mother's name? Etc.""

All's well that ends well. The child gets admitted into the school. But that is not the end of the story. For admission in a government school, at the pre-Nursery level, one has to pay nothing.

School owners and even principals feel this should be a voluntary exercise as almost every student in such schools is already following a proper vaccination schedule through their private paediatrician.

While no one wanted to speak officially, schools felt that this mass vaccination should be optional. ""Parents themselves are vary of having their child take any kind of vaccination without their own doctor's supervision. And this tendency is not just limited to the upper middle or rich class now, because everyone has access to a paediatrician and regularly inoculate their children,"" said a school trustee.

Another trustee, who also owns a college, said that the mass vaccination programme is perfect for students in NMC and zilla parishad schools as 'they may not have access to private health care'. ""I fully support the government's initiative and it must focus on students who are normally deprived of such immunization programmes. I am sure there would even be private unaided schools in city whose students would be in need of this important vaccine, hence the best option would be for government to contact schools and seek parents' consent,"" he said.

Officials who are part of the immunization drive say there is no question of taking consent for this. Dr Mohd. Sajid, who's part of the core team looking after the drive in Nagpur, said, ""It's like chlorination of drinking water, no consent is necessary. Also it does not matter if child has taken two doses in advance, as this is as additional dose. In fact I have discussed this issue with a few schools and told them to inform parents, but there is no mention of parental consent even in the government guideline.""

He added that the drive must be viewed as a 'community level' health intervention. ""If even a single child is left behind then he could be a potential carrier of the virus,"" said Dr Sajid.

But a principal told TOI that getting consent from parents is crucial. ""Parents nowadays are very aware and aggressive when it comes to rights of their children, and we can't fault them for that. Already a handful of parents are approaching teachers and wanting to know if the school will allow the immunization programme. And I am sure by this month's end every single parent will be asking that question,"" she said. In April this year, almost 40 schools in Gurugram too refused to participate in it in the immunization drive, citing lack of consent of parents.

Paediatricians in city are already giving out MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) combo vaccination to children and it is part of the schedule chart too.

The parent had also approached the authorities once by lodging a complaint in Chief Minister's Grievance Cell regarding announcing of winter vacations in accordance with government orders. However, he says, ""Probably, the school has 'influences'. That is how they survive despite opposing the government orders.""

He says that he never received a response from the cell. However, some government official had been to the school after some days which again, ""was of no use.""

""They went there for inspection and still they closed the school after 3 days of the inspection. And guess what! No action was taken against them!"" he exclaims.

""Who are they to decide when to declare a holiday and when not to? My child would have really enjoyed the holiday at home. Now, this Jayanti makes no difference to her,"" he adds.

When asked why they keep opposing the norms, the Administrative In-charge DIS told Free Press Kashmir that the school had been closed on 1st October as a day before it had celebrated its Annual Day.

""We had celebrated our Annual Day a day before. The teachers and students were tired. So, we decided to keep Monday a holiday,"" said Mehnaz, Manager DIS. When told that the school cannot bend the rules as per their convenience, she says, ""This is for the first time that we have kept the school running on a National holiday. Otherwise, we frame out holidays as per the government order. This time, due to the Annual Day celebrations, the students had already missed classes. We needed to recover that as well.""

As far as other schools are concerned, the faculty says that they are called to school even if there is not much to do there.

""There are no students in the school. Still, we have been called to make lesson plans and do some paperwork,"" says a faculty member from Oasis School, on condition of anonymity.

""It's not that we don't want to work or that we only look for excuses to stay home. But, it's our right to stay home when there is a holiday,"" the teacher adds.

TRSMA had given a bandh call protesting against the State government's decision making it mandatory for the schools to obtain No Objection Certificates from fire department, traffic control and the corporation.

While parents criticised the move and called it a ploy by the schools to further pressurise the government from acting against them in their massive profiteering, teachers were unhappy that exam schedule had to be adjusted due to the bandh.

Glendale Academy, Chirec, Future Kids, Kalpa, Brilliant High School, Slate the School and Kennedy High the Global School were among the schools which were shut on Friday, either supporting the bandh call or declared holiday as a precautionary measure.

Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) condemned the bandh call for not just disrupting academic schedule but also involving the students in a fight that's not theirs.HSPA in a statement said that it was ""unbelievable... that a government which is supporting school managements on the gross violation of every single norm related to regulation of schools and fees charged would not be looking into these issues raised by schools.""

Ashish Naredi, a parent, said that schools are projecting that parents and teachers are supporting their demands.""This is false and if schools are so concerned about the welfare then they should they implement GO MS 1 and give 50 per cent of the fee as salaries to teachers and constitute parents teachers association. But all they do is muzzle teachers voices if they protest by sacking them and that of parents by harassing students,"" he said.

Given the mind-boggling scale of the demand, the private sector's participation is definitely a welcome move. India has one of the world's largest higher education systems, but it is still not adequate. Since 2003, India has apparently been adding more than 1,000 private colleges every year. Lacking in quality control, this expansion did not quite contribute to skill development or boost the nation's 'knowledge economy', and the private sector mostly remained the second-rate, fallback option for the desperate. As the number of 'educated' unemployed kept on growing, some of these teaching shops died their natural death.

In recent years, however, some old private brands have been re-inventing themselves, with fresh investments in quality faculty and research, scholarships and so on. The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent philanthropic interventions. More such interventions are needed for paradigm-shifting experimentation towards excellence, which the government often cannot risk as it spends taxpayers' money and is hence bound by safe rules. Students in Indian institutions have traditionally studied subjects in silos, as the system mostly did not allow for the multidisciplinary and int­erdisciplinary approach to learning.

The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent ­philanthropic ­interventions.

Realising much ahead of the herd that real problems need real solutions, the Shiv Nadar University started in 2011 with a multidisciplinary, 'liberal studies' curriculum, offering an excellent mix of science, engineering and social science teaching and research. One can't be a problem-solving engineer, for example, without understanding the social context. Similarly, policy-making on key iss­ues often needs to be science-driven -- a slightly expensive proposition, as cutting-edge science and technology research often needs heavy resources. But there cannot be any short-cuts if we wish to deliver what is needed.

Learning has to be curiosity-driven and enjoyable. The 'liberal studies' app­roach allows learners to experiment and find their passion. With the job market changing fast, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are key skills we need to impart. In the new institutions, curriculum content is dynamic and flexible, and the mode of delivery active or participatory, with students 'learning by doing'. Even undergraduate students are encouraged to grasp the nua­nces of research and innovation, while we stre­ngthen their foundation with a broad multidisciplinary approach and provide a depth of learning in a major subject.

And yet a growing number of fee-paying Indian students go abroad even at the undergraduate level -- the high cost is not a deterrent. While 'reputation management' is a serious issue, to build people's trust in India being a safe and welcoming country, we need to go for ser­ious accreditation and benchmarking of our institutions to make our country a higher-education destination. We need to hold all the institutions accountable in a transparent, fair and progressive manner. Private institutions have strong ­in-built internal accountability. We should bring in healthy competition to the public- and private-funded universities. Global rankings are one way, but their focus on uniformity of parameters may narrow the diversity that universities need for innovation in every sphere -- in strategy, curricula, pedagogy and research. We should find and retain some unique advantages of the Indian higher education system.

The country urgently needs a global and contextual vision plan, and a competent leadership with the necessary res­ources to carry the plan through. The system needs to be rebuilt with strong, equitable and credible partnerships -- national and international, academic and industrial, public and private -- bes­ides intra-institution (interdisciplinary) to inter-institution collaborations for inn­ovation and research excellence, capacity-­building and training the trainers, better teaching tools, enhancing students' employability, and connecting education to issues of livelihood and sustainability of future generations. This is the only way forward.

""We have now received guidelines from the state government and the committee will be set up soon,"" Singh said.

The UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath government on April 3, 2018, and signed by the governor on April 9. And on August 30, the ordinance was replaced with a law that was passed by a voice vote in the state assembly.

According to provisions of the Act, which covers all private CBSE, ICSE and state board-affiliated schools, all private schools that charge more than Rs 20,000 annually will have to revise their fee structure for all classes so as to bring down the financial burden on parents.

Moreover, admission fee can be charged only twice -- when a student joins school and after they complete Class X and seek admission for Class XI, according to the Act.

Schools also can't change uniform for five years. Fees charged by a school during 2015-16 will be the basis for implementing the regulation, the Act states.

Apart from the district magistrate, the committee will have a chartered accountant, a PWD executive engineer-rank official and a senior official from the UP State Finance and Accounts Services. It will also include a representative of parents association, a principal or manager of a self-financed school and the district inspector of schools.

Once the committee is set up in the district, officials said, it will address the complaints by parents regarding arbitrary fee hike and also work on putting a cap of the upper limits of fees that private schools can charge. Schools can be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh on first and second offence, respectively. Following this, it can be de-recognised.

""If private schools have to submit NOCs from fire and traffic departments as well as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation for safety purposes, the same should also be implemented for government schools. They can't mandate something like this in the name of safety only for private schools. Also, these rules were formulated only a few years back, whereas many of these schools were established about 20-30 years ago.

They further said that the state cannot allocate the entire education budget only for students studying in government schools as it is their responsibility to provide free education to each and every student.

The minister's statements put the schools in dilemma, forcing them to remain mum on the subject, even after most of them had informed the students and guardians in the morning about their decision to suspend classes or defer exams.

""Some private schools have decided to stay closed. We have already urged them to keep them open. I am again requesting them to keep the schools open. There is no need to worry.

""We have no other option but to suspend classes because our school buses won't ply. We will postpone the practical examinations of senior school and call off the classes,"" said Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha. La Martiniere for Boys has advanced its dispersal timings.

As soon as the schools decided to postpone exams and suspend classes, Chatterjee issued a diktat to keep their schedule unchanged. The school authorities, however, declined to comment.

Chatterjee pointed out they might might be affiliated to ICSE or CBSE, but the schools had to take NOCs from the state. ""We have never interfered in any unfortunate incident, which had happened in some of the schools. They could have taken suggestions from the school education department. We have issued a circular to keep the schools open.

The Directorate of School Education is planning to implement the Aadhaar based biometric attendance in private and corporate schools. The new system is being planned for both students and teachers on a pilot basis to regulate attendance and weed out fake enrolments.

Officials of the Directorate of School Education are of the view that Aadhaar based biometric attendance would also aid in preparing Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data with ease. According to the statistics available with the directorate, about 11,262 private unaided schools are functioning in the State with 31,19,525 enrolments.

""As per provisions in the GO MS 1, the department has the authority to regulate and inspect private schools. The biometric attendance will be implemented as part of the regulations,"" an official said.

For regulating schemes like midday meals and to improve the attendance of students and teachers, the directorate has commenced installing 12,700 biometric systems in 9,349 government and local body schools in 12 districts in the State on a pilot basis. A biometric machine is being provided to schools with a strength of 100 students and managements have been instructed to record students' attendance before serving the midday meal while for teaching and non-teaching staff it will be done in the mornings and evenings.

The programme is being implemented in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India and State Information Technology Department. The IT Department has developed a software for dashboard to monitor attendance in real time. So far, attendance of more than 10,000 students studying in the government and local body schools is being monitored through the dashboard.

Speaking to Telangana Today, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association president S Sreenivas Reddy said the private schools have already installed biometric machines for recording the attendance of teachers.

""It is not possible to implement biometric attendance for students in private schools as the strength ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 and it will consume a lot of time,"" he said."

The recent gang rape of a girl in a Dehradun school has once again raised questions regarding safety and security of schoolchildren. Known for their quality of education, private schools in Uttarakhand attract students from all over the country. However, there are visible gaps in formation, implementation and monitoring of safety measures in the private schools.

SC Guidelines

As per the Supreme Court guidelines on child safety in schools, a school management should install sufficient CCTV cameras on campus, facing road and and periphery. When a team of Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) inspected the school where the gang rape took place, it did not find CCTV cameras in hostels. The UCPCR team also found that the girls' hostel, housing 22 students, did not have any warden for a month.

The Supreme Court guidelines also state that all areas of the school premises should be regularly monitored and any unauthorised person should be questioned for their presence. School management is also required to appoint some staff as vigilance monitors on rotation to keep an eye on all activities of students. However, these are guidelines. A set of non-negotiable child safety conditions for schools is still awaited.

Accountability

Welham Boys' School principal Guneet Bindra said, ""When parents leave their children in a residential school, school authorities become their pseudo parents. We have to care for each and every child as our own. This includes taking care of their health, hygiene, safety and well-being.""

Bindra said negligence of any kind by a school in the safety of a child is unacceptable. ""Internal security of a school is vital and cannot be compromised.""

Safety in schools

In October last year, the principals' progressive school association (PPSA) issued a safety advisory to all its 176 member schools of Dehradun. These included installing CCTV cameras and their regular monitoring, police verification of all employees, advising parents not to drop off their children to school too early or pick them up too late and an entry system of each student, preferably in the form of biometric. The advisory also stated that no area of the school should be left unattended.

""The members of the association meet annually to discuss issues of safety and security of the children. We also ensure that all the member schools follow the guidelines that we have laid down,"" president of PPSA Prem Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

""However, the school where this unfortunate incident took place is not a member of PPSA and I have never visited the campus as well. So I do not know how they were operating,"" Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

Case of ICSE schools

Jennifer Kumar, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) school association's state president, said: ""ICSE has issued guidelines for safety of students, which we abide by. There are periodic inspections by members of the council to monitor the same."" She said security of a student was of 'paramount importance', irrespective of which examination board the school is affiliated with."

Days after the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) issued a suspension notice against two private schools here the Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) Tuesday said they have received fresh complaints against some more private schools for charging exorbitant fee in violation of its directives.

Chairman of FFC, Justice (Retd) Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain said the committee has received some new complaints against private schools for violating its recommended fee structure.

Hussain said FFC has received complaints from the parents of students enrolled in Minto Circle School, Srinagar who are 'violating' the FFC norms by charging exorbitant fee from them.

Meanwhile another member of FFC wishing anonymity told Rising Kashmir that it has received a complaint from the parents against Linton Hall School, Rajbagh for the same issue.

According to FFC, they have recommended Rs 1200 for Linton Hall School, Rajbagh but in violation of norms the school is charging Rs 1350 per month.

When asked about the recent suspension orders to RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh, Hussain said, ""We had informed both the school authorities to charge only recommended fee, but they did not adhere to that. The complaints of those schools were received by FFC and DSEK.""

The parents of various schools told Rising Kashmir that they want to register complaints against the private schools who violate the norms of FFC but they are unaware of the process to do so. The parents said they want to know whether they can file complaints online.

However, the chairman of FFC blamed the parents for not filing complaints against those schools who are violating FFC guidelines. ""We cannot act against any school till we have a genuine complaint or proof against it. In today's meeting we have told our Chief Education Officers (CEO) to conduct inspection of all schools who are violating the FFC norms,"" FFC chairman said.

Replying to a query he said, ""All the private schools are violating the norms but only those are caught and highlighted against whom the complaints have been filed by the parents. Parents fear reprisal but we assure them their complaints are kept confidential.""

FFC Chairman added that they have regulated the tuition fee structure of various prominent schools which includes DPS Srinagar, Presentation Convent, Mallinson and Tyndale Biscoe School, Burn Hall School and many other schools.

He said the missionary schools like Biscoe and Mallinson charge Rs 35,000 as admission fee and for the whole year they charge Rs 85,000 which includes tuition fee, transport fee and other charges as well.

""RP School or Green Valley cannot be compared with DPS Srinagar because the Supreme Court in its guidelines had mentioned that the school with more facilities can charge accordingly,"" Hussain said.

He further said that for RP School FFC has recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee but they are charging Rs 1900 which is a violation of FFC guidelines.

""Similarly, Green Valley Educational Institute has a good amount of surplus money and that is why we told them that why they are charging more than what FFC has recommended,"" he added."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The department of school education, Kashmir has de-recognised two prominent private schools in downtown Srinagar on September 15.

However, the decision has turned out to be controversial as parents of the schoolchildren claim that it could damage the academic career of their kids. The schools facing the axe are RP School and Green Valley Educational Institute located in Malla Bagh, an area in downtown Srinagar.

Although the reason mentioned by the education department officials behind the de-recognition is the exorbitant fee charged by the school management, a section of the parents allege that the decision by the administration could be a crackdown on schools that are teaching Islamic moral education.

The posts on social media in support of the school administrations have now gone viral. This indicates that the present state administration may be opposed to the idea of teaching Islamic education in valley schools.

Social media users posted pictures of the students offering Namaz (Islamic prayers) and women teachers and students clad in Hijab and Burqa on school premises. They also claimed that the state administration under the garb of exorbitant fees did not want the preaching of Islamic practices among students.

""Fee hikes are a norm in all big schools. But singling out a school where Islamic education in being taught, where zuhr prayer is a must. It is disgraceful. In RP we trust. I am proud I have spent few of my years in RP. My future daughter is going to RP,"" Aafan Hakak tweeted.

A post which lays down fees sturucture of various eminent schools in the state, which includes Christian missionary schools besides others, said that the two schools which faced de-recognition comparatively charged lesser fees.

""These schools which face the suspension charge only half the amount of montly fees compared to the missionary schools and other elite institutions which are run by affluent people. This is a selective decision and there is a greater design to regulate the religious teachings among students,"" a parent, under the condition of anonymity, said.

A medico, Masood Rashid whose children are studying in RP School wrote on Fcaebook, ""I strongly condemn biased and selective action by DSEK against RP School Malabagh...My children are reading in same school...Fee structure is less than other schools or equal...I want to know who are these self-styled parent association...Who has given them consent...Who made them representatives...These self styled association people are actually extortionists and their only aim is to get extrabenifits for their own children...They usually blackmail school authorities...DSEK and pseudo parent representatives are fully responsible for whatever trauma to out-going students and their parents....""

Director School Education has also called for adjusting the enrolled students of these schools in nearby Government schools for ensuing examination. Itoo has also cautioned all the heads of the private institutions not to hike the fee on their own and comply with the instructions and orders from the department, in letter and spirit. Though slammed for being harsh in some quarters, the decision has come as a shot in the arm of the parents who are otherwise largely taken for granted by the management of the private schools and made to pay through their nose. So, the extreme action by the government is certain to lend them some sense of empowerment. And in future they won't find themselves solely at the mercy of the school managements who don't shy away from forcing the parents to pay up the entire fees even in times of disasters like the 2014 deluge. One could hope that the government action reigns in the private schools which have otherwise become a law unto themselves.

Last year, the state government's school fee fixation committee has given a nod to the enhancement of fee structure of private educational institutions by eight percent. The order issued in October last is valid for three years. The decision came after the J&K High Court directed the state government to frame a policy regarding annual fee enhancement. But as the derecognized two schools would have us believe, the government's orders are observed largely in breach. The schools would easily get away with their arbitrary fee hikes, cocking a snook at the government. And parents are in no position to resist this.

But again the people are bound to watch Itoo's order with some scepticism. Will the new action succeed where the previous initiatives have failed? Only time will tell. But the outcome of the past interventions should hardly detract from the significance of the fresh measure. Director School Education has the power to get private schools to fall in line. He is in a position to withdraw the recognition should schools refuse to do his bidding as he has now practically demonstrated.

Ideally, the private schools, especially the elite schools, should have taken the lead and in a spirit of mutual understanding worked with the parents to fix a mutually agreed amount of fees. But this isn't happening. And now the government has taken a note of this arbitrary state of affairs and acted with suspension of the recognition of the two schools. But it needs to follow it up with actions that make a visible difference on the ground. More so, in a situation where private school managements have not been enough socially responsible to act on their own."

He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

On Thursday, the department served notices to 186 private schools of the state affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) in this regard. The state government had taken a decision earlier this year to make books by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) compulsory for all private CBSE schools of the state. This decision was also backed by the high court in April.

Alok Shekhar Tiwari, director general of primary education, said: ""This matter will not be taken lightly. We have issued notices to these schools and have sought their reply.

We will also seek the court's guidelines on further action. If the court so instructs, we will withdraw the NOCs of these schools and will register an FIR against them as well.""

CBSE grants affiliation to a school only if it has an NOC by the state government. Tiwari said the department cannot proceed in the matter independently as it is sub-judice.

In its judgment, the court had said that if a school is prescribing books from private publishers, they should be at par with the NCERT books in terms of quality and cost. Schools cannot prescribe books from private publishers which cost more than NCERT books.

After receiving several complaints from the parents, education minister Arvind Pandey constituted nodal officers in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to survey all the private schools in their respective districts and identify the defaulters.

The officers found 186 out of 226 private schools in violation of the high court order.

""The schools have been trying to defend themselves by saying that the books by private publishers are for their library but it is baseless.

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

He said the government had not considered their inputs before evolving various policies. School managements are willing to implement no bag day once a month, he added. He urged the department to declare second Saturday as holiday for students so that they get time to spend with their family.

As many as 1.42 crore children and adults in the age group of 1 to 19 will be administered Albendazole during the State level drive to prevent intestinal worm infections. A biannual Vitamin A supplementation programme will also be implemented during the period.

As per the ninth annual status of education report 2014, 29 per cent of total enrolments at the national level are in private schools. In Odisha, the percentage of private school admissions is 8.5. The drive will be conducted in 27 districts and aligned with mass drug administration in the rest three lymphatic districts of Cuttack, Khurda and Dhenkanal. Children from one to five years of age will be administered Albendazole suspension and those in the age bracket of six to 19 will be given tablet. Pre-school and school kids are at the risk of parasitic intestinal worm infections - Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH). Worms can cause anaemia and nutritional impairment, thereby affecting mental and physical development.

As estimated by the national centre for disease control, the STH rate in Odisha is 38 per cent. Parasitic infections result from poor sanitation as well as unhygienic conditions and are easily transmitted to children through contact with infected soil. A health official said mass deworming leads to significant improvement in outcomes related to education, career choice, earnings and long-term well being. Since the consequences of chronic worm infection in children are widespread and debilitating and kids with high intensity of STH infection are too sick to concentrate in schools or Anganwadi centres, dewo r ming is an important intervention to combat malnutrition, he said. Sources said the deworming coverage was 92 per cent during the last round in April.

The Health department has chalked out strategies to reach out-of school children and private schools in urban areas to increase the coverage and achieve the census target. Meanwhile, the Project Director of Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority (OPEPA) has sought cooperation of all district education officers, project coordinators of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) and block education officers to make the drive successful.

A group of researchers have recommended this following their study that shows one out of every 10 students of Delhi's private schools suffer from obesity, high blood pressure and increased levels of bad cholesterol.

Together, these risk factors make them vulnerable to develop a host of non-communicable diseases, primarily cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. They are the major cause of adult mortality and illness worldwide.

The students of government schools, who come from lower socio-economic strata, are relatively less vulnerable to get these diseases, the study conducted by researchers from AIIMS, Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Institute of Health Management and Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says. It has been published in Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR).

The research involved screening of 1369, 786 boys and 543 girls -- studying in grades II and XI in 10 randmly selected private schools and nine government schools.

The percentage of overweight and obese students among private schools was 13% and 9% respectively. Among the government school students, only 3% students were found to be overweight and none of them were found to be obese. Number of underweight students in government schools was, however, noted to be three times that of the private school students.

Hypertension and bad cholesterol, risk factors usually associated with increasing age and unhealthy lifestyle, was also found to be affecting the students.

In the study, the prevalence of hypertensive students in private schools was 13% and in government schools it was 4.5%. Monika Arora, the lead author of the study told TOI, this is the first research to report on the distribution of multiple risk factors for NCDs in school students in India, comparing low socio-economic status (government schools) to high socio-economic status (private schools).

""Private school students had 29 times the prevalence of obese students compared to government schools,"" she said. Arora blamed sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating for the increased risk and stressed on the need for comprehensive, school-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyle among them.

Harvard School of Public Health has, in a study on economic losses due to non-communicable diseases, has estimated the economic burden of these ailments for India will be close to $6.2 trillion for 2012-30, a figure that is nearly nine times the total health expenditure during the previous 19 years of $710 billion."

High demand for admissions

Despite there being 35 private schools in the district, parents seem to prefer the Zilla Parishad High School in Bakhalwada colony. Unable to handle the number of applications for admission, this school has put up a ""no admissions"" board at the entrance. In the last few years, admissions get filled within the first week of June in this school. The High School has 796 students studying between classes 6 and 10 who are accommodated in 35 classrooms. There are two sections for Telugu students and three for English in each class. The school has 46 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching staff, a library, science lab and playground apart from other facilities. ""Last three years, we secured 100 per cent pass in Class-X examinations,"" says the school headmaster Banda Venkat Reddy. While the school is 'almost perfect' the headmaster has urged the government to construct a kitchen where midday meals can be cooked.

'Train' them for future!

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders! Every since the boring school became a 'train school' dropout rates have frozen, say authorities. Also, they are seeing a sudden jump in attendance rate. Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train. ""At present, we have 270 students coming from Kancherla, Maddimall and Veernapalli villages. Since the makeover, donations have increased and we used this amount to hire two additional teachers,"" says the school headmaster Bukya Gajan. It's not just students, the school has also become a local tourist attraction with people visiting the spot to take selfies.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

Nizam-era Telugu medium school still going strong

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

Several Private schools in Delhi have decided not to celebrate the Teachers' Day on September 5. A few of those are likely to observe a muted celebrations. The private schools have taken this decision citing ""spate of arrests"" of teachers and principals in the national capital. The school authorities also alleged that they were treated in poor, unfair manner. An association of over 160 senior secondary private schools, The National Progressive Schools' Conference (NPSC), has reportedly issued an advisory to schools.

The Affordable Private Schools' Association has also decided not to celebrate Teachers' Day on September 5. ""We, the educationist fraternity, have to restore the value in our society and respect of the teachers, so that we can bring trust in the system,"" it said in a statement. Earlier on August 21, the Springdales Education Society had sent a note stating it will not be hosting the Teachers' Day dinner this year.

The Springdales Education Society circular said this is ""owing to a series of disturbing events in schools, in and outside Delhi, where principals and teachers have been held accountable for situations that in many instances have not been the responsibility of schools and their management"". ""Teachers are being targeted on unproven allegations of a lack of safety of school children. The relationship between the school and parents, too, is merely transactional and not what we desire it to be or what it used to be,"" it said.

Two teachers and the principal of a school were arrested after a Class IX student allegedly committed suicide. Parents had accused teacher and the school of harassing the student.

Earlier in April, the National Coalition for School Education (NCSE) had demanded reforms in education, including amendment to the Right to Education Act. Speaking to reporters, NCSE chairman Kulbhushan Sharma said, ""While the state of education calls for urgent reform, the government seems to be working only for appeasement and quick fix.""

A survey that assessed students across 20 states revealed that 9 in 10 children in urban private schools cannot read in English.

The report, 'Where India reads 2017-18', covered 19,765 children of classes IV, V and VI in 106 private schools in cities, across 20 states, including Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir among others.

The survey conducted by Stones2Milestones, an organisation that aims to address the reading and learning levels of school going students. This was reviewed by Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER).

The report suggests that problem lies within our households. ""English is a second or even third language, in several Indian households and children speak in their mother tongue which is either Hindi or a regional language. However, at school they are expected to learn a language which is foreign to them, in a formal setting.""

Nikhil Saraf, co-founder, Stones2Milestones, said, ""The test was conducted online to check comprehension, vocabulary and reading habits of students under their teachers' supervision. Some students answered a few test items in an unreasonably short time. Since it is unlikely for a small child to read and respond in snap of a finger, we did not count for scoring.""

""This also points to several behavioural peculiarities, which could include reading fatigue, non-seriousness and bad monitoring practices.""

The schools were provided with a list of suggestions and actions needed to improve reading levels based on the assessment report.

""The focus should be to make reading to the core as a learning focus rather than just restrict it to a namesake library period,"" said Kavish Gadia, co-founder and CEO, Stones2Milestones.

Christel R Devadaswon, head, Department of English, University of Delhi, said, ""A policy is required to improve the literacy rate and stakeholders should look at the perspective of children and their socioeconomic situations.""

Venita Kaul, ex-senior education specialist and chairperson of the Advisory Committee of Center for Early Childhood Education and Development (CECED), said, ""I hope this report will initiate a discussion on challenges many Indian children face due to multi-lingual environment at home. It will sensitise parents, teachers and other stakeholders regarding the need to revisit classroom pedagogy for teaching reading to children. This is an urgent need in primary schools since children learn best in ways more developmentally and contextually appropriate for them. Once that is done, future assessments of children's reading skills will undoubtedly present a more favourable picture of their reading levels."""

These are some of the facts that were presented by two development researchers in a presentation titled ""How do Households Finance Private School Education?"" in an international conference on public policy and management organised by IIM, Bengaluru in New Delhi recently.

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there.

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative.

Speaking about the same with news agency PTI, UIDAI chief Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said that the department is aware about the fact that some private schools are demanding Aadhaar cards for admission of students. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey told the news agency.

The UIDAI has also warned the school administration to make sure that none of the students are denied admission for not providing Aadhaar as admission document. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" Pandey said.

The Supreme Court, in September this year, upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and stated that it would remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN). However, the top court also mentioned that the 12-digital unique identification number will not be mandatory for opening bank accounts, mobile connections and school admissions.

The apex court's directive also stated that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

Also read: Private schools will lose affiliation if they charge extra fees or sell uniforms: CBSE

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

An endless debate rages in the education sector over whether school education ought to be run solely by the state or allowed to move into private hands.

Though a host of individuals, experts and organisations strongly favour a state-run education system, the fact is that state schools all over the world, including India, have witnessed a steady outflow of children to the private school system. ""Parents are voting with their feet. The private education sector exists for a reason and we have to stop pretending that it doesn't,"" says Aashti Zaidi Hai, director of the ..."

Apparently, the poor didn't know the value of education and used their children as labour.

This debate should have died after the 1991 liberalisation when poor parents woke up and became eager to send their children to English medium schools. Was this treated as good news? Not really, for the elites found something else to complain about.

The poor wanted schools, but couldn't find any. Many primary schools that had supposedly been ""built"" by government in remote villages simply didn't exist: that money had long evaporated through corruption. Where the poor did have a local primary school, it was dilapidated and its appointed teachers didn't even come to the school. And in the few cases where the teachers did come, the parents found the teachers to be hopelessly incompetent. Not a surprise since most of them have bribed their way into the job.

And so, as Gurcharan Das has said, India grows at night. Where the government fails, private enterprise steps in to retrieve the situation and bring in a modicum of development. That's what happened in the school sector. To meet this huge demand, private for-profit low-cost schools sprung up like mushrooms. These were not perfect by any stretch of imagination but they were vastly superior to the non-existent or even the average government ""school"", as Tooley's diligent research has shown.

When this happened, the elites moved their goalpost and started complaining against these private schools. Anurag Behar's recent article in Live Mint is a case in point. No matter the poor do, India's elites will always find something wrong with them.

The elites are now demanding a huge increase in government management and funding in the school sector. Apparently, it was not enough for the government to have failed totally and comprehensively for 70 years. Our only saviour is our government once again, headed by criminals who appoint teachers through bribes and who pocket the taxes allocated for school infrastructure. According to our elites, the private sector is nothing but a pain in the neck and must be sidelined.

In my view there are two explanations for this inexplicable view by people like Mr Behar. Either these elites are grossly ill-informed or they have a hidden agenda. Is it possible that not being capable of delivering better low-cost schools that poor parents will pay for, in the face of cut-throat competition, elite NGOs are bagging their competition in order to grab government subsidies?

But let me take a more charitable perspective, which turns out to be possibly worse in some ways. I suspect the real explanation is that these elites have a strong ideological belief in socialism which has made them blind to the blatant crimes and corruption of government, even where the evidence is right in front of their nose.

In India we pay twice for everything: first we pay the government, and then, after it has failed, we pay a second time, to the private sector, to finally get the job done, with whatever money we still have left in our pocket.

The elites must surely realise that nothing concentrates the mind more than poverty. Even the slightest expenditure the poor make must pass the most stringent tests. That poor parents are choosing to pay twice for their children's education tells that something is seriously wrong with the government system. To suggest that such poor people are stupid and gullible is to discount what they are trying to tell us: Stop looting us and let us free.

We know from Tooley's research (and I have some personal direct evidence that I'll mention some other day in another context) that these parents are actively monitoring the performance of their children. And to ensure that these parents' don't move their child to another school, the school owners are constantly monitoring the performance of the teachers. The incentives align perfectly.

Of course, these schools have poor infrastructure - but that's all the poor can pay for. This, however, is not the pivotal issue. Gandhi rightly told us that it is not school infrastructure but the teacher that matters most. We need teachers who actually come to teach. And second, that these teachers are at least moderately competent.

It is unfortunate that an institution named after one of India's greatest entrepreneurs, Aziz Premji, has such a dim view about perhaps the greatest example of entrepreneurship in the world - the low cost for-profit private schools of India.

Good policy can't be made by assuming a role for government. It must begin by understanding any market failure and doing the best to support the market to overcome any such failure. Today there is a real market in school education in India with very little market failure. All we need is to support these schools through school vouchers for the poorest of the poor. Indeed, that's our party's policy.

One last point. Mr Behar points out that teachers in such schools are paid below the minimum wage. Our party rejects the very concept of minimum wage which is both theoretically and practically proven to harm the poorest of the poor. Our party will abolish minimum wage laws. Instead of seeing this as a problem, I suggest that Mr Behar celebrate the vast employment that these schools have generated and how well they are serving a genuine need to the best of their ability - despite total government antipathy.

It is not that these teachers are underpaid. Instead, teachers in government schools are grossly overpaid. In a private competitive system, teachers would all receive their marginal product. Better teachers would be paid vastly more than any teacher is paid today."

A division bench comprising Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the interim reprieve to private educational institutions, on a plea moved by All India Private Educational Institutions Association assailing the amendment dated January 25.

According to the petitioner, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act and the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act provided exemption from payment of property tax to educational institutions in the state.

The state government brought in certain amendments to these Acts to remove the exemption provided to the institutions and empowering the authorities to levy property tax for the properties owned by the institutions. After the amendment, only government run educational institutions would get the exemption, the petitioner said.

This is in violation with the policy on Karnataka Educational Institutions (Regulation of Certain Fees and Donations) (Amendment) Rules 2018, which has been in force mandating the schools to stick to the calendar of events released by the Department of Public Instruction for admission.

The issue has gone viral on social media platforms, where parents have formed groups alleging that schools are charging up to '1,000 as fee per application form without confirming a seat.

This reporter from The New Indian Express visited some schools on Friday posing as a parent seeking admission and was shocked to learn that some schools have even closed the admission process for the next academic year.

Authorities of one such school located in South Bengaluru, offering both CBSE and ICSE syllabus, said, ""You are too late. We have already finished issuing applications for the next academic year and seats will also be announced soon.""

Another prime school, also located in Bengaluru South, issued the application form, but said they cannot assure a seat as they have already received application forms in excess of the seats available. ""We cannot assure you the seat. We are already flooded with applications. You will have to try your luck. If someone surrenders their seat, you may get a chance,"" said a front office staff member.

So blatant is this malpractice in the background of the sheer lack of regulation or enforcement of rules that some schools have even dared to publish their commencement of admission process for academic year 2019-20 on their official websites without fear of reprisals.

Shilpa Prashanth, a South Bengaluru parent said, ""I was looking for admission of my son at one of the prime schools in our locality, but I was surprised to hear that I was too late. Although I approached them in mid-October, the school had already closed the admission process.""

Another parent said, ""I took applications for my son from three main schools in West Bengaluru, but of the three, one school said they cannot promise a seat, while another demanded full payment of fees up front, now itself. So, I have decided to wait for communication from the third school.""

Moreover, some of the schools which are confirming the seats while collecting advance fees to block the seats, are refraining from giving a receipt to the parents in return for the payment. ""We have to agree at the risk of losing the amount as the schools are not giving receipts. But, as it is hard to get seats in these schools, we are being forced to agree and accept whatever the conditions laid down by the schools,"" said one desperate parent.

Paying heavy price for education

Scared to file plaint

Although the District Education Regulatory Authority (DERA) is active, parents do not dare to file complaints as they are worried that such an act would affect their child's prospects in getting a seat

WHAT THE RULE SAYS

According to the Karnataka Education Act, the schools established in the state are not allowed to start admissions for the next academic year until the state department of public instructions releases the calendar of events

Normally, the calendar is released in the end of April or first week of May

It can be recalled that when Tanveer Sait was the primary and secondary education minister, he had directed his department officials to quash all such ""early admissions"" and declare them illegal"

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

The Association while condemning the move said that the certain lobby in administration and few other quarters who in one way or other are trying to destroy the fledgling private education sector in Kashmir.

G N Var, chairman PSAJK said that Legal Metrology Department, Directorate of School Education, Fee Fixation Committee, district administration and everybody who wields some sort of power are swooping down on small private schools to harass them. In the name of selling books, schools are being targeted unnecessarily.

""Today running a private school has become a herculean task. With mudslinging, barrage of allegations and character assassinations, private schools are being labelled as some kind of criminals,"" he said.

War said incidentally, there is no rule which specifically says that schools cannot keep books in their schools for sale.

It was in the same year that CBSE's rule of counter-signature of TCs from school to the other was scrapped.

CBSE wrote to schools a few weeks ago saying that many schools are not following the rule even though it is mandatory. It added that students are facing unnecessary delays in admissions because of this. In the post-2014 scenario, CBSE simplified the Std X and XII admission process by asking the new schools to simply verify the student's TC from his previous school's web site and complete the admission formalities. But with private schools ignoring the rule, the paperwork for student increases and it delays admission in the new school.

Even though this practice is mandatory, none of the Nagpur-based private schools, whose websites were checked by TOI, had uploaded details of the TC. They didn't even give any tab on website mentioning that no TCs were taken. Government controlled Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) have a separate tab on their website which gives details of TCs issued in the current academic year. While KVs have been a step ahead of their private counterparts in implementing the rule, they still have not complied fully with CBSE's diktat, though the details they mention contain all required information.

CBSE's rule is very clear. It says that a scanned copy of the TC has to be uploaded on the school's website. While KV's website have not uploaded a scanned copy, they have mentioned clearly every relevant detail of the TC. This includes the student's name, father's name, TC number, issuing date, class etc."

The Jammu and Kashmir government Thursday said it will issue guidelines to regulate prices of textbooks and uniforms of private schools in the state.

The decision comes after questions were raised about sale of textbooks and uniforms at exorbitant rates by private schools.

Advisor to the governor Khurshid Ahmed Ganai has issued directions to the directors of the School Education, Kashmir and Jammu, to immediately examine the complaints about sale of textbooks at exorbitant prices by private schools in the state and recommend measures to regulate the rates, an official spokesman said.

Taking cognisance of the reports published by a section of media, Ganai, who also holds the charge of the Education Department, said the government will issue guidelines to regulate prices of textbooks and uniforms of private schools in the state on the analogy of regulation of fee structure of these schools.

He assured of strict action against those who resort to ""extortion and illegal profiteering"" by selling textbooks at exorbitant rates."

It is now a well-known fact that many schools force parents to buy books and uniforms only from a particular shop. This way they earn some extra money from the sale of the books and uniforms which in turn are sold to parents at an exorbitant cost. A prominent missionary school in Baramulla was recently fined for selling textbooks through a single bookshop only. But the menace is not confined to a single school only. Many elite schools in the Valley themselves sell these books but no action has so far been taken against them. It is thus necessary that the action against schools shouldn't be initiated on a selective basis.

Also, forays into commercial activities isn't only thing that is wrong with the private schools: their arbitrary fee structure and for that matter the quality of their teaching itself is a great cause of concern. What is needed, therefore, is not only the regulation of their commercial activities and the fee structure but a comprehensive look at the whole system of private schooling in the state. The objective should not be more regulation of these schools but to ensure that they deliver quality education for which they charge heavily. Kashmir has witnessed an unprecedented growth of private schools and most of these lack infrastructure and adequately qualified staff. And even with schools which have the infrastructure, the quality of education is pits.

Private schools have tried to act as more disciplined and rigorous academic counterparts of the Government schools: regular class work, less holidays and more extra-curricular activities have been their hallmark. But so far as quality of education is concerned, there is little that sets them apart. They charge heavy fees from the parents and compensate it not by imparting good quality education but by showing off some style: bright uniforms and more extra-curricular activities. Education in these schools is about stage-management: loaded satchels, excessive homework and an endless supply of stationary which in turn is cleverly bound up with the business part of running a school.

The aspect of the school which gets least attention is the education, which in turn boils down to the recruitment of good teachers. The schools hire the disaffected educated youth who are willing to work for a pittance as a prelude to a much sought-after permanent government job. And most of them miserably lack the depth of knowledge to be good teachers. This malaise afflicts our educational system right through - from primary schools to the universities. Surprisingly, some of the franchise schools which have forayed into Valley in recent years are similarly afflicted: a large, imposing infrastructure but little depth in the all-important tuition part of their functioning. Even though, it is equally the job of parents to see that these schools provide the quality education they seek for their wards, government can help by forcing these institutions to pay well to the teachers which in turn will attract better talent."

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Nov. 3 : A legislator has noted reports that are implied to be practices of subtle discrimination in private institutions. Some of these include priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to 'weak' students; or schools asking parents to deposit money, which are not returned unless their wards improve in performance.

The advisor was addressing the 25th anniversary of the All Nagaland Private Schools Association, Dimapur unit (ANSPA) at the Dimapur District Sports Council which was packed with students, teachers, and guests on November 3 to celebrate the silver jubilee.

The advisor for School Education, K Tokugha Sukhalu, attended the occasion as its main guest. He said that the private schools were performing better than the government institutions in terms of discipline, culture and accountability. While Dimapur is comparatively better than the rest of the districts, he said, there is very less space for outdoor activities though. He said learning methods are changing and the ANSPA should be able to manage trained personnel so that children are equipped with proper skills. He appealed to the teachers to ensure that courses are completed in time and ensure children are taught properly.

However, the advisor pointed out some of negative reports that reportedly were doing the rounds with regard to private educational institutions. These reports included alleged priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to weak students; reputed schools asking parents to deposit money and unless the children improve, funds are reportedly not returned.

At these, he asked the teachers to be proud of their students no matter what 'background difference' there may be. One cannot compare students based on their educational backgrounds and ""you never know the brightest students may lose tomorrow,"" he said. Institutions should not be only for profit-making but to ensure that students are nurtured to be the leaders of future, he reminded.

Enrolment in private institutions is increasing whereas enrolment in government institutions is decreasing. So, the responsibility is huge for the ANSPA, Sukhalu remarked. He added that students are the future and urged the children to pledge to be the ""leaders of tomorrow.""

The director of the Central Board of School Education at Guwahati, KK choudhury, also addressed the event. He said that ""Nagaland is a big contributor to the literacy rate of the country with 80.11%.""

In this changing scenario, non-conventional subjects are getting importance and employment opportunities are being widened. Almost 90% of job opportunities are available in the unorganised sector, he said. The official encouraged the gathering to embrace technology and incorporate the knowledge in their field. Further, he said that the Northeast region contributes greatly to the cultural and natural resources of the country."

The list available with the state department of public instructions, provided by the Deputy Directors of Public Instructions (DDPI), indicates that over 50 private schools affiliated to various boards have violated the act and are not introducing Kannada as their first or second language.

Following the recommendations by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), the state government had decided to make Kannada a compulsory subject (first or second language) at all the schools functioning in the state, irrespective of the board they follow, and the same had been implemented from the academic year 2018-19. But, even six months after the commencement of the academic year, some schools have been found violating the rule.

When the state government took this decision, several private schools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE boards had raised an objection. But, later as it became a state policy, the schools were forced to implement it.

Recently, the Kannada Development Authority received complaints against some of the schools alleging that they were not following the said rule. Based on the complaints, KDA chairperson Prof SG Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the state department of primary and secondary education to submit a report.

""Following the letter received from the KDA chairperson, we have instructed our DDPIs to visit the schools across the state and submit a report about the alleged violation. For some of the districts, we have yet to get the report,"" said Basavaraja, director of primary education department.

He said the department would initiate an action against such schools soon by first issuing notices as per the process. ""Once we get the report from all the districts we will issue notices to school managements which are violating the Compulsory Kannada rule,"" Basavaraja said.

The KDA authorities, on their part, have directed the primary and secondary education department to initiate action to disaffiliate such schools. Prof Siddaramaiah said, ""I have written a letter to the education department about the violation of the act by some of the private schools and have asked them to submit action taken report. But till date we have not received a reply from them. The department must take measures immediately to disaffiliate such schools.""

However, the rule framed by the department has no provisions to disaffiliate violating schools. As per the rules, the department can only levy a penalty of '500 on such schools in the first year."

She said her excitement at her daughter getting enrolled in a private school in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar was short-lived as she was forced to then spend money on her books, uniform and stationery. ""My daughter was admitted to Anglo Indian Public School in Class 1, under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, this year.

The woman said she was concerned about paying for her daughter's winter uniform, which would cost at least Rs 3,000.

Officials at Anglo Indian Public School said they had been unable to provide free uniforms and stationery items because they had not yet received any funds from the government. Chander Singh, a spokesperson for the school, said: ""Last year too, we received only Rs 1,125 per student. How can this amount cover books, uniform and stationery items and examination fees?""

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25 % of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and first standard -- are to be reserved for children whose parents earn less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.

At present, the Delhi government is supposed to reimburse Rs 1,100 per student for uniforms and another Rs 2,200 for books, stationery, tuition and exam fees.

HT is in possession of at least 100 complaints, written by families who claim they have been deprived of the free study material and uniforms by private schools.

Debate over funds

In 2013, a group of private schools had moved the Delhi high court claiming that the amount paid by the state government per child was too low to meet all expenses. The court, in 2014, directed private schools to provide books, stationery items and uniforms to students under the EWS/DG categories, and said it was the responsibility of both the government and the schools to ensure free education to these students. The matter is still subjudice. Even as the Delhi high court issued as many as 46 reminders to private schools between April 2014 and September 2018 to provide the required materials, parents claim they have still not received anything.

Most of the private schools this correspondent contacted declined to comment, saying the matter was subjudice.

Kamal Gupta, counsellor, Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools in Delhi, a body representing 450 private schools said half the schools have not received any funds from the government.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's education department -- Directorate of Education (DoE) -- said it already provided funds to the private schools and was requesting the government for ""additional funds"" to meet the revised estimates. The government, this year, increased the reimbursement amount by Rs 600.

""Whatever demand is pending for this year will be fully met by end-November. However, the delayed release of funds cannot be the reason for private schools not giving books and uniforms to the students,"" he said. Goel said the DoE had also issued multiple notices to many schools and warned they would de-recognise them if they did not provide books and uniforms.

Parents bear costs

Another parent, requesting anonymity, said two of his children were not given uniforms by a private school in north Delhi. ""My children got admission in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category this year. The school had given them used books but not uniforms and stationery. I had to buy those myself,"" said the man, who works in a grocery shop and earns Rs 5,000 a month.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate representing families in Delhi high court, said, ""There is no provision under which the parents can claim reimbursements once they spend the money on these things. They can only be issued a fresh set of uniforms or books once the schools get the money.""

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

According to records of the Directorate of Education (DoE) , of the 48,122 seats reserved under the so-called economically weaker section or EWS category in private schools at the entry level, only 35,500 seats have been filled. And according to a recent report submitted by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to the DoE, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

The schools have given a variety of reasons for refusing admission: no vacancies; the school being too far from the home of the child seeking admission; or that even general category seats are yet to be filled. The sixth round of admissions is still underway.

In some cases, parents this correspondent interviewed alleged that private schools denied admission to their wards even after their names appeared in the selected lists. DoE's response to this is that many such families do not report for admission even after the names have come up in the draw of lots and the selected names are displayed on the DoE website. DoE, which comes under the state government's education department, releases the list of selected candidates.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said, ""All these seats are vacant in less popular schools. Parents are not interested in getting their kids enrolled there. We have issued multiple notices to the schools after receiving complaints from parents. We have also sent our officials in many schools for inspection and found that parents did not report there.""

One parent says he and his ward reported and were turned away. ""I have been making rounds to Panchsheel Public School in Badarpur since March for the admission of my six-year-old son. His name appeared for admission in Class I in the first list. However, we were told that there was no vacancy and we would be called by the school when all the general seats are filled. How can he be allotted a school where there are no vacancies?"" said Tasneem Ahmed, who works in a grocery shop. He has been applying to enrol his son in a private school under the EWS category for the last three years.

""He will exceed the age limit if he does not get admission this year,"" said Ahmed. Children over the age of six are not eligible for entry-level admission in the EWS category.

Officials at Panchsheel Public School said there are no seats on offer. ""We had only one vacancy for class I this year and we had informed the DoE about it. We do not have any vacant seat,"" said Bharti Mehta, principal of the school.

Similarly, Shiv Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Mehrauli, said his four-year-old son was denied admission in Deep Public School in Vasant Kunj. ""I was not even given a proper reason for the denial. An official said that there was no vacancy,"" he claimed Officials at the school, however, denied the charges saying that all students whose names appeared in the list were given admission.

Still, there are some instances where the children have not reported for admission. This reporter met some families which did not report for admission to the schools. Many said the school was far from home. ""I stay in north Delhi's Samaipur Badli and my four-year-old was assigned three schools in Dwarka, which is at the distance of 20 km from our house. How can we enrol our little one there?"" asked Jyoti Kumari, a homemaker.

As per norms, children must be assigned schools within 3km range of their residence for entry level classes.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of seats are to be reserved for the EWS category in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools. Despite receiving over 100,000 applications every year, thousands of seats go vacant. As per the affidavits submitted by DoE in the Delhi high court, copies of which are with Hindustan Times, of 48,122 available EWS seats in private schools in Delhi, only 20,000 and 19,000 were filled in the last two academic sessions, 2017-18 and 2016-17, respectively.

DoE said it has set the target of filling at least 40,000 seats this year. ""We are yet to complete the final round of admission and hoping to fill over 40,000 seats this year,"" Goel said.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate in the Delhi high court said he has filed as many as 50 individual cases on behalf of the parents denied admission this academic session. ""This is a failure of DoE. Every year seats are going vacant and thousands of children are deprived of education in decent private schools. Strict actions need to taken against these schools rather than issuing circulars and notices.""

Experts working for the cause said that they have also approached to the Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia seeking his intervention. ""We have received innumerable complaints from parents who were denied admission by private schools to the education minister but to no avail. Hundreds of parents are still struggling to get their kids enrolled,"" said Ekramul Haque of NGO Mission Taleem.

Manish Sisodia did not respond to calls and messages despite repeated attempts."

'Fee fixation panel doesn't have adequate manpower to monitor thousands of schools'

Ahead of the new academic session, parents have expressed resentment against excessive tuition and admission fee charged by various private schools.

The parents have also accused Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) of not taking action against some schools despite repeated complaints. The allegations come in the wake of de-recognition of two private schools by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) for charging exorbitant fee.

Parents who have admitted their wards in Iqbal Memorial Institute (IMI) Bemina claimed that they had complained about the extra money charged by the school several times, but the Fee Fixation Committee didn't show any interest to address the issue.

""I admitted my son in the year 2015 and that time they charged me Rs 35,000 as admission fee. Presently the school is charging extra Rs 3900 as annual charges,"" said one of the parents wishing not to be identified.

""Earlier the school was charging Rs 2000 as monthly fee but after the FFC recommended them to charge just Rs 1890, the school adhered to the direction. Now again they are charging Rs 250 extra as computer fee and I am paying Rs 2150 a month including computer charges,"" he added.

Similarly, parents of those students who have admitted their kids in Kashmir Harvard Habak, complained that the school charged Rs 80,000 as admission fee besides charging Rs 3400 as monthly fee including transport charges.

One of the parents said that he admitted his daughter a few weeks late in the school and the authorities charged him extra money, saying that the school has increased the tuition fee.

""I am paying Rs 1500 for the 2nd standard student and more than Rs 1300 for 4th standard,"" he said.

Pertinently, the FFC has recommended Rs 1320 for 2nd standard.

Parents of those students, who have admitted their wards in Presentation Convent School, said they have paid Rs 70,000 as admission fee.

The parents also said that the tuition fee for a year is included in the admission fee.

According to one of the parents, who has admitted her ward in Presentation Convent Srinagar, in summers the school charges Rs 5090 as tuition fee for three months excluding transportation fee which is Rs 1500 per month.

""For winters the school is charging Rs 9120 tuition fee for three months which means we have are paying Rs 3040 per month excluding transportation charges,"" she said.

Similarly, as per sources Burn Hall School Srinagar also charges Rs 80,000 as admission fee.

""The admission fee is merely meant for the admissions; no tuition fee is included in admission fee.""

According to parents, the school charges Rs 2800 as monthly tuition fee in winters and over Rs 2600 in summers.

""In winters we are paying Rs 8,600 as tuition fee for three months excluding transport fee which is Rs 4800 and for the summers we are paying above Rs 8,000 excluding transport fee.""

According to the FFC, the school is supposed to charge Rs 1890 for first standard to 10th standard and Rs 2390 for 11th and 12th standard.

The FFC order (No 262-FFC of 2018 dated 21-02-2018) has clearly mentioned that the school shall not charge any other kind of fee unless a prior permission for the same is obtained.

Parents said Delhi Public School (DPS) Srinagar is charging Rs 1.10 lakh as admission fee.

One of the parents, Tahir Ahmad Dar (name changed) said his ward is studying in UKG and the school authorities are charging Rs 2750 as monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 monthly bus fee.

His two other kids are studying in 8th standard and 5th standard and he is paying Rs 4250 monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 bus fee for both classes.

According to FFC, the Linton Hall School in Rajbagh is supposed to charge Rs 1200 per month for the students of UKG to 10th standard as tuition fee.

However, top officials of FFC said they are they are charging Rs 1350 more as monthly tuition fee.

The FFC official said they have recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee for RP School, ""but they started charging Rs 1900 which also resulted in the suspension of its recognition"".

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora is charging Rs 83,000 as admission fee for the new entrants of nursery class and KG-I.

Sources told Rising Kashmir that the school has different charges for admission as the school is charging Rs 48,000 as admission fee for students getting admitted in 11th standard in which school is taking tuition fee from the admission fee for a year.

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora had been recommended Rs 2520 for KG-I, Rs 2140 for KG-II, Rs 1700 for the Ist class to 8th standard and Rs 1950 for the 9th and 10th standard.

For the 11th standard, the FFC allowed the school to charge Rs 3255 for medical students and Rs 3015 for Arts students and for 12th standard the school had been allowed to charge Rs 3580 for the medical students and Rs 3320 for Arts students.

The FFC official said the school was violating norms and will not reclaim recognition unless they adhere to its guidelines.

The parents of those wards who are studying in Foundation World School said they are being charged Rs 50,000 as admission fee.

Parent of one of the wards said, ""My kid is studying in the nursery class and I am paying Rs 8000 monthly fee including Rs 6000 tuition fee and Rs 2000 transport fee.""

Parents of those wards who are studying in GD Goenka Srinagar said the school charged Rs 1 lakh earlier for new admissions and Rs 7,000 as monthly fee including the bus charges.

Another parent whose two kids are studying in Biscoe School said he is paying Rs 2730 for 4th standard and Rs 2760 for 8th standard.

""Last year the admission fee was Rs 65,000 in which the school was offering one-year tuition fee and uniform charges as well. The school is giving proper receipt of admission fee which other private schools don't. They take fee draft,"" he said.

The Woodlands School Shivpora charges Rs 28,000 as admission fee for new entrants.

""They are charging Rs 3200 fee. The school charges transport fee according to the distance.""

Officials in FFC said they lack manpower and cannot monitor each and every private school.

""There are more than two thousand private schools in the valley and we don't have that much of manpower available with us. This committee was formed a few years back and it will take time to upgrade it,"" he said.

When contacted, the chairperson and officials of FFC did not respond to repeated calls and messages from this reporter.

Director School Education Kashmir, GN Itoo said the complaints against any school received by FFC are being taken seriously and necessary action will be taken immediately.

""Recently FFC has issued a circular in which they have asked all private schools to reveal their current fee structure, admission fee and transportation fee as well and once they will get the details from schools, it will be decided by DSEK as to what should be done with the violators,"" he said.

Itoo further said the FFC has sought help from DSEK also. ""And we have assured them that nodal officers from CEO office will help them at the district level.""

years of 2016-17 and 2017-18, an analysis has shown.

The analysis, commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), was carried out by Indus Action, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) working towards implementation of Section 12(1)(C) of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clause mandates that private, unaided schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats in entry-level classes for EWS/DG category students.

The data for the analysis was obtained from the Directorate of Education (DoE).

According to the report filed by the NGO, 48 private schools did not admit any student under the quota in 2016-17 while seven schools registered no admissions under the category in 2017-18. Additionally, about 19 private schools did not admit a single child in both years.

""One of the things asked by the DCPCR to the NGO was to analyse and list the schools who had not given admission to a single child under the quota despite allotment of the seats with them,"" member of DCPCR Anurag Kundu said.

The commission has asked for the phone number of parents allotted seats under the quota, along with reasons recorded by these schools for not admitting them from the DoE.

""All this has been requested to corroborate the claims, by both parents and the school... and to find what the truth is and then initiate an enquiry accordingly,"" Kundu added.

The DoE was not available for comment when approached by the Sunday Standard.

""Private schools are primarily are not interested in giving admissions to children belonging to the EWS and DG category. The improper monitoring by the education department has further given them

leverage to deny admission,"" said Advocate and social activist Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist which fights for people belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group.

""The purpose of carrying the analysis was to send show cause notice to such private schools. It appeared some of these schools in Delhi outrightly denied. Some cited 1:3 rule and others cited invalidity of income or caste certificates as reasons for not admitting children under the reservation,"" Tushar Bhadwar of Indus

Action said."

Apart from the backbreaking process of admissions, the money deposited as 'admission fee' is not even tax-free.

With passing years, the government taxes are only increasing in the valley. From eateries to earnings to the money people spend, everything comes with a tax. ""For what we have, we can pay the taxes. But for what we already spent, how can they ask for tax?"" asks a parent Tawheed Ahmad who recently got his kin admitted in a reputed private school in Srinagar.

After a baby is born, one looks at its face and thinks about the number of classes he/she has to study. People wait for the baby to start talking so that they can send them to a playschool where they can learn alphabets, rhymes, words, numbers, puzzles, games, colours and how to talk in English. This time is 'crucial' for the child as it will decide whether the child can get admitted in a reputed school or not.

""We tried to teach our child at home but in a play school, they learn discipline and exactly the things that will be asked in their interview,"" says Ahmad.

Ahmad had sent his ward to a playschool at the age of 3. ""He would still be sleeping when we would wake him up. He would cry a lot before leaving for the playschool. He would sleep for hours after coming back. This is the necessity of time,"" he explains adding that he had to pay around Rs. 2000 per month as the fees of the playschool for 2 years.

As soon as the news about the availability of school forms came, Ahmad and his wife like thousands of other parents in Kashmir ran to schools in the middle of the night, lining in a queue to grab a form.

""We went to many schools. I sent my brother to some places, me and my wife went to Tyndale Biscoe School. It was around 3 in the morning. There were already 3-4 parents waiting outside the school. We waited and waited. We had taken Namkeen Chai with us. We had breakfast on the road and finally the gate opened,"" he recalls.

After submitting the form, he says, the family would be after the child, asking him all sorts of questions like, ""What is your name, What is your father's name? What is your mother's name? Etc.""

All's well that ends well. The child gets admitted into the school. But that is not the end of the story. For admission in a government school, at the pre-Nursery level, one has to pay nothing.

""We had started saving even before he was born. But, even that is somehow not enough as we have to pay taxes for the amount of money we pay as admission fees. While paying the taxes on our earnings, we can only show the receipt of the tuition fees,"" says Tawheed.

""It has been going on for years. This is exploitation. First, the schools suck our blood and then the government,"" he adds.

A Chartered Accountant from the valley says, ""We as CA's do not go into the reasoning part of the laws. It is the forte of the lawmakers who draft these laws. I think only the tuition fee is considered as the admission fees is usually hefty. If they, exempt the admission fees, their tax revenue will go down.

School owners and even principals feel this should be a voluntary exercise as almost every student in such schools is already following a proper vaccination schedule through their private paediatrician.

While no one wanted to speak officially, schools felt that this mass vaccination should be optional. ""Parents themselves are vary of having their child take any kind of vaccination without their own doctor's supervision. And this tendency is not just limited to the upper middle or rich class now, because everyone has access to a paediatrician and regularly inoculate their children,"" said a school trustee.

Another trustee, who also owns a college, said that the mass vaccination programme is perfect for students in NMC and zilla parishad schools as 'they may not have access to private health care'. ""I fully support the government's initiative and it must focus on students who are normally deprived of such immunization programmes. I am sure there would even be private unaided schools in city whose students would be in need of this important vaccine, hence the best option would be for government to contact schools and seek parents' consent,"" he said.

Officials who are part of the immunization drive say there is no question of taking consent for this. Dr Mohd. Sajid, who's part of the core team looking after the drive in Nagpur, said, ""It's like chlorination of drinking water, no consent is necessary. Also it does not matter if child has taken two doses in advance, as this is as additional dose. In fact I have discussed this issue with a few schools and told them to inform parents, but there is no mention of parental consent even in the government guideline.""

He added that the drive must be viewed as a 'community level' health intervention. ""If even a single child is left behind then he could be a potential carrier of the virus,"" said Dr Sajid.

But a principal told TOI that getting consent from parents is crucial. ""Parents nowadays are very aware and aggressive when it comes to rights of their children, and we can't fault them for that. Already a handful of parents are approaching teachers and wanting to know if the school will allow the immunization programme. And I am sure by this month's end every single parent will be asking that question,"" she said. In April this year, almost 40 schools in Gurugram too refused to participate in it in the immunization drive, citing lack of consent of parents.

Paediatricians in city are already giving out MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) combo vaccination to children and it is part of the schedule chart too. A school principal said, ""Since private doctors are already giving the vaccine, I feel parents in top schools will keep their kids away from the mass vaccination drive."""

Gandhi Jayanti, India's National Holiday is one such holiday for students of some private educational institutions in Kashmir. There is no alternative for them and the authorities despite knowing fail to address the issue.

While the government offices, educational institutions and banks stay closed today to celebrate Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's birthday, also celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence, some private educational institutions including Doon International (DIS), Presentation Convent (PCS), New Convent and Oasis School continue to work today. While students were called to DIS and PCS, in some other schools the teachers were called up to do the 'paperwork'.

When the government declares summer or winter holidays, they make sure to stretch the working days by 10 to 15 days. Gandhi Jayanti is a National Holiday!

The parent had also approached the authorities once by lodging a complaint in Chief Minister's Grievance Cell regarding announcing of winter vacations in accordance with government orders. However, he says, ""Probably, the school has 'influences'. That is how they survive despite opposing the government orders.""

""Who are they to decide when to declare a holiday and when not to? My child would have really enjoyed the holiday at home. Now, this Jayanti makes no difference to her,"" he adds.

When asked why they keep opposing the norms, the Administrative In-charge DIS told Free Press Kashmir that the school had been closed on 1st October as a day before it had celebrated its Annual Day.

""We had celebrated our Annual Day a day before. The teachers and students were tired. So, we decided to keep Monday a holiday,"" said Mehnaz, Manager DIS. When told that the school cannot bend the rules as per their convenience, she says, ""This is for the first time that we have kept the school running on a National holiday. Otherwise, we frame out holidays as per the government order. This time, due to the Annual Day celebrations, the students had already missed classes. We needed to recover that as well.""

As far as other schools are concerned, the faculty says that they are called to school even if there is not much to do there.

""There are no students in the school. Still, we have been called to make lesson plans and do some paperwork,"" says a faculty member from Oasis School, on condition of anonymity.

""It's not that we don't want to work or that we only look for excuses to stay home. But, it's our right to stay home when there is a holiday,"" the teacher adds.

TRSMA had given a bandh call protesting against the State government's decision making it mandatory for the schools to obtain No Objection Certificates from fire department, traffic control and the corporation.

While parents criticised the move and called it a ploy by the schools to further pressurise the government from acting against them in their massive profiteering, teachers were unhappy that exam schedule had to be adjusted due to the bandh.

Glendale Academy, Chirec, Future Kids, Kalpa, Brilliant High School, Slate the School and Kennedy High the Global School were among the schools which were shut on Friday, either supporting the bandh call or declared holiday as a precautionary measure.

Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) condemned the bandh call for not just disrupting academic schedule but also involving the students in a fight that's not theirs.HSPA in a statement said that it was ""unbelievable... that a government which is supporting school managements on the gross violation of every single norm related to regulation of schools and fees charged would not be looking into these issues raised by schools.""

India has one of the world's largest higher education systems, but it is still not adequate. Since 2003, India has apparently been adding more than 1,000 private colleges every year. Lacking in quality control, this expansion did not quite contribute to skill development or boost the nation's 'knowledge economy', and the private sector mostly remained the second-rate, fallback option for the desperate. As the number of 'educated' unemployed kept on growing, some of these teaching shops died their natural death.

In recent years, however, some old private brands have been re-inventing themselves, with fresh investments in quality faculty and research, scholarships and so on. The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent philanthropic interventions. More such interventions are needed for paradigm-shifting experimentation towards excellence, which the government often cannot risk as it spends taxpayers' money and is hence bound by safe rules. Students in Indian institutions have traditionally studied subjects in silos, as the system mostly did not allow for the multidisciplinary and int­erdisciplinary approach to learning.

The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent ­philanthropic ­interventions.

Realising much ahead of the herd that real problems need real solutions, the Shiv Nadar University started in 2011 with a multidisciplinary, 'liberal studies' curriculum, offering an excellent mix of science, engineering and social science teaching and research. One can't be a problem-solving engineer, for example, without understanding the social context. Similarly, policy-making on key iss­ues often needs to be science-driven -- a slightly expensive proposition, as cutting-edge science and technology research often needs heavy resources. But there cannot be any short-cuts if we wish to deliver what is needed.

Learning has to be curiosity-driven and enjoyable. The 'liberal studies' app­roach allows learners to experiment and find their passion. With the job market changing fast, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are key skills we need to impart. In the new institutions, curriculum content is dynamic and flexible, and the mode of delivery active or participatory, with students 'learning by doing'. Even undergraduate students are encouraged to grasp the nua­nces of research and innovation, while we stre­ngthen their foundation with a broad multidisciplinary approach and provide a depth of learning in a major subject.

And yet a growing number of fee-paying Indian students go abroad even at the undergraduate level -- the high cost is not a deterrent. While 'reputation management' is a serious issue, to build people's trust in India being a safe and welcoming country, we need to go for ser­ious accreditation and benchmarking of our institutions to make our country a higher-education destination. We need to hold all the institutions accountable in a transparent, fair and progressive manner. Private institutions have strong ­in-built internal accountability. We should bring in healthy competition to the public- and private-funded universities. Global rankings are one way, but their focus on uniformity of parameters may narrow the diversity that universities need for innovation in every sphere -- in strategy, curricula, pedagogy and research. We should find and retain some unique advantages of the Indian higher education system.

The country urgently needs a global and contextual vision plan, and a competent leadership with the necessary res­ources to carry the plan through. The system needs to be rebuilt with strong, equitable and credible partnerships -- national and international, academic and industrial, public and private -- bes­ides intra-institution (interdisciplinary) to inter-institution collaborations for inn­ovation and research excellence, capacity-­building and training the trainers, better teaching tools, enhancing students' employability, and connecting education to issues of livelihood and sustainability of future generations. This is the only way forward.

According to a TOI report, the management has alleged that private schools are being discriminated against with such rules which are not applicable to government schools, thus demanding for equal treatment.

The management of private schools said that such demands of the state will lead to nearly 600 schools in the state to remain closed every year, which in turn will have serious repercussions for the economically backward sections of the society and their access to quality education.

District magistrate B N Singh told TOI on Thursday that the committee will be work under his direct supervision to regulate the fee structure of all private schools in Gautam Budh Nagar, almost a month after the UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) Act, 2018, came into effect. ""We have now received guidelines from the state government and the committee will be set up soon,"" Singh said.

The UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath government on April 3, 2018, and signed by the governor on April 9. And on August 30, the ordinance was replaced with a law that was passed by a voice vote in the state assembly.

According to provisions of the Act, which covers all private CBSE, ICSE and state board-affiliated schools, all private schools that charge more than Rs 20,000 annually will have to revise their fee structure for all classes so as to bring down the financial burden on parents.

Moreover, admission fee can be charged only twice -- when a student joins school and after they complete Class X and seek admission for Class XI, according to the Act.

Schools also can't change uniform for five years. Fees charged by a school during 2015-16 will be the basis for implementing the regulation, the Act states.

Apart from the district magistrate, the committee will have a chartered accountant, a PWD executive engineer-rank official and a senior official from the UP State Finance and Accounts Services. It will also include a representative of parents association, a principal or manager of a self-financed school and the district inspector of schools.

Once the committee is set up in the district, officials said, it will address the complaints by parents regarding arbitrary fee hike and also work on putting a cap of the upper limits of fees that private schools can charge. Schools can be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh on first and second offence, respectively. Following this, it can be de-recognised.

""If private schools have to submit NOCs from fire and traffic departments as well as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation for safety purposes, the same should also be implemented for government schools. They can't mandate something like this in the name of safety only for private schools.

The minister's statements put the schools in dilemma, forcing them to remain mum on the subject, even after most of them had informed the students and guardians in the morning about their decision to suspend classes or defer exams.

""Some private schools have decided to stay closed. We have already urged them to keep them open. I am again requesting them to keep the schools open. There is no need to worry.

While DPS Ruby Park called off classes for the primary section, Mahadevi Birla World Academy has suspended all the classes. ""We have no other option but to suspend classes because our school buses won't ply. We will postpone the practical examinations of senior school and call off the classes,"" said Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha. La Martiniere for Boys has advanced its dispersal timings.

As soon as the schools decided to postpone exams and suspend classes, Chatterjee issued a diktat to keep their schedule unchanged. The school authorities, however, declined to comment.

Chatterjee pointed out they might might be affiliated to ICSE or CBSE, but the schools had to take NOCs from the state. ""We have never interfered in any unfortunate incident, which had happened in some of the schools. They could have taken suggestions from the school education department. We have issued a circular to keep the schools open. Despite our requests, if some schools decide to defy our orders, we shall probe the activities of private schools affiliated to other boards, which we have not done till now,"" the minister said.

Officials of the Directorate of School Education are of the view that Aadhaar based biometric attendance would also aid in preparing Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data with ease. According to the statistics available with the directorate, about 11,262 private unaided schools are functioning in the State with 31,19,525 enrolments.

The recent gang rape of a girl in a Dehradun school has once again raised questions regarding safety and security of schoolchildren. Known for their quality of education, private schools in Uttarakhand attract students from all over the country. However, there are visible gaps in formation, implementation and monitoring of safety measures in the private schools.

SC Guidelines

As per the Supreme Court guidelines on child safety in schools, a school management should install sufficient CCTV cameras on campus, facing road and and periphery. When a team of Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) inspected the school where the gang rape took place, it did not find CCTV cameras in hostels. The UCPCR team also found that the girls' hostel, housing 22 students, did not have any warden for a month.

The Supreme Court guidelines also state that all areas of the school premises should be regularly monitored and any unauthorised person should be questioned for their presence. School management is also required to appoint some staff as vigilance monitors on rotation to keep an eye on all activities of students. However, these are guidelines. A set of non-negotiable child safety conditions for schools is still awaited.

Accountability

Welham Boys' School principal Guneet Bindra said, ""When parents leave their children in a residential school, school authorities become their pseudo parents. We have to care for each and every child as our own. This includes taking care of their health, hygiene, safety and well-being.""

Bindra said negligence of any kind by a school in the safety of a child is unacceptable. ""Internal security of a school is vital and cannot be compromised.""

Safety in schools

In October last year, the principals' progressive school association (PPSA) issued a safety advisory to all its 176 member schools of Dehradun. These included installing CCTV cameras and their regular monitoring, police verification of all employees, advising parents not to drop off their children to school too early or pick them up too late and an entry system of each student, preferably in the form of biometric. The advisory also stated that no area of the school should be left unattended.

""The members of the association meet annually to discuss issues of safety and security of the children. We also ensure that all the member schools follow the guidelines that we have laid down,"" president of PPSA Prem Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

Days after the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) issued a suspension notice against two private schools here the Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) Tuesday said they have received fresh complaints against some more private schools for charging exorbitant fee in violation of its directives.

Chairman of FFC, Justice (Retd) Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain said the committee has received some new complaints against private schools for violating its recommended fee structure.

Hussain said FFC has received complaints from the parents of students enrolled in Minto Circle School, Srinagar who are 'violating' the FFC norms by charging exorbitant fee from them.

Meanwhile another member of FFC wishing anonymity told Rising Kashmir that it has received a complaint from the parents against Linton Hall School, Rajbagh for the same issue.

According to FFC, they have recommended Rs 1200 for Linton Hall School, Rajbagh but in violation of norms the school is charging Rs 1350 per month.

When asked about the recent suspension orders to RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh, Hussain said, ""We had informed both the school authorities to charge only recommended fee, but they did not adhere to that. The complaints of those schools were received by FFC and DSEK.""

The parents of various schools told Rising Kashmir that they want to register complaints against the private schools who violate the norms of FFC but they are unaware of the process to do so. The parents said they want to know whether they can file complaints online.

However, the chairman of FFC blamed the parents for not filing complaints against those schools who are violating FFC guidelines. ""We cannot act against any school till we have a genuine complaint or proof against it. In today's meeting we have told our Chief Education Officers (CEO) to conduct inspection of all schools who are violating the FFC norms,"" FFC chairman said.

Replying to a query he said, ""All the private schools are violating the norms but only those are caught and highlighted against whom the complaints have been filed by the parents. Parents fear reprisal but we assure them their complaints are kept confidential.""

FFC Chairman added that they have regulated the tuition fee structure of various prominent schools which includes DPS Srinagar, Presentation Convent, Mallinson and Tyndale Biscoe School, Burn Hall School and many other schools.

He said the missionary schools like Biscoe and Mallinson charge Rs 35,000 as admission fee and for the whole year they charge Rs 85,000 which includes tuition fee, transport fee and other charges as well.

""RP School or Green Valley cannot be compared with DPS Srinagar because the Supreme Court in its guidelines had mentioned that the school with more facilities can charge accordingly,"" Hussain said.

He further said that for RP School FFC has recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee but they are charging Rs 1900 which is a violation of FFC guidelines.

""Similarly, Green Valley Educational Institute has a good amount of surplus money and that is why we told them that why they are charging more than what FFC has recommended,"" he added."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The department of school education, Kashmir has de-recognised two prominent private schools in downtown Srinagar on September 15.

However, the decision has turned out to be controversial as parents of the schoolchildren claim that it could damage the academic career of their kids. The schools facing the axe are RP School and Green Valley Educational Institute located in Malla Bagh, an area in downtown Srinagar.

Although the reason mentioned by the education department officials behind the de-recognition is the exorbitant fee charged by the school management, a section of the parents allege that the decision by the administration could be a crackdown on schools that are teaching Islamic moral education.

The posts on social media in support of the school administrations have now gone viral. This indicates that the present state administration may be opposed to the idea of teaching Islamic education in valley schools.

Social media users posted pictures of the students offering Namaz (Islamic prayers) and women teachers and students clad in Hijab and Burqa on school premises. They also claimed that the state administration under the garb of exorbitant fees did not want the preaching of Islamic practices among students.

""Fee hikes are a norm in all big schools. But singling out a school where Islamic education in being taught, where zuhr prayer is a must. It is disgraceful. In RP we trust. I am proud I have spent few of my years in RP. My future daughter is going to RP,"" Aafan Hakak tweeted.

A post which lays down fees sturucture of various eminent schools in the state, which includes Christian missionary schools besides others, said that the two schools which faced de-recognition comparatively charged lesser fees.

""These schools which face the suspension charge only half the amount of montly fees compared to the missionary schools and other elite institutions which are run by affluent people. This is a selective decision and there is a greater design to regulate the religious teachings among students,"" a parent, under the condition of anonymity, said.

A medico, Masood Rashid whose children are studying in RP School wrote on Fcaebook, ""I strongly condemn biased and selective action by DSEK against RP School Malabagh...My children are reading in same school...Fee structure is less than other schools or equal...I want to know who are these self-styled parent association...Who has given them consent...Who made them representatives...These self styled association people are actually extortionists and their only aim is to get extrabenifits for their own children...They usually blackmail school authorities...DSEK and pseudo parent representatives are fully responsible for whatever trauma to out-going students and their parents....""

Director School Education has also called for adjusting the enrolled students of these schools in nearby Government schools for ensuing examination. Itoo has also cautioned all the heads of the private institutions not to hike the fee on their own and comply with the instructions and orders from the department, in letter and spirit. Though slammed for being harsh in some quarters, the decision has come as a shot in the arm of the parents who are otherwise largely taken for granted by the management of the private schools and made to pay through their nose. So, the extreme action by the government is certain to lend them some sense of empowerment. And in future they won't find themselves solely at the mercy of the school managements who don't shy away from forcing the parents to pay up the entire fees even in times of disasters like the 2014 deluge. One could hope that the government action reigns in the private schools which have otherwise become a law unto themselves.

Last year, the state government's school fee fixation committee has given a nod to the enhancement of fee structure of private educational institutions by eight percent. The order issued in October last is valid for three years. The decision came after the J&K High Court directed the state government to frame a policy regarding annual fee enhancement. But as the derecognized two schools would have us believe, the government's orders are observed largely in breach. The schools would easily get away with their arbitrary fee hikes, cocking a snook at the government. And parents are in no position to resist this.

But again the people are bound to watch Itoo's order with some scepticism. Will the new action succeed where the previous initiatives have failed? Only time will tell. But the outcome of the past interventions should hardly detract from the significance of the fresh measure. Director School Education has the power to get private schools to fall in line. He is in a position to withdraw the recognition should schools refuse to do his bidding as he has now practically demonstrated.

Ideally, the private schools, especially the elite schools, should have taken the lead and in a spirit of mutual understanding worked with the parents to fix a mutually agreed amount of fees. But this isn't happening. And now the government has taken a note of this arbitrary state of affairs and acted with suspension of the recognition of the two schools. But it needs to follow it up with actions that make a visible difference on the ground. More so, in a situation where private school managements have not been enough socially responsible to act on their own."

On Saturday, School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan, announced that separate mark sheets each for 600 marks will be issued for Classes 11 and 12. He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

Warning strict action against private schools in Uttarakhand prescribing non-NCERT books, the director general of primary education department has said it may even lead to cancellation of their no-objection certificates (NOCs).

On Thursday, the department served notices to 186 private schools of the state affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) in this regard. The state government had taken a decision earlier this year to make books by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) compulsory for all private CBSE schools of the state. This decision was also backed by the high court in April.

Alok Shekhar Tiwari, director general of primary education, said: ""This matter will not be taken lightly. We have issued notices to these schools and have sought their reply. The schools have acted against the high court verdict, which is contempt of court and we will bring this to the court's notice.

We will also seek the court's guidelines on further action. If the court so instructs, we will withdraw the NOCs of these schools and will register an FIR against them as well.""

CBSE grants affiliation to a school only if it has an NOC by the state government. Tiwari said the department cannot proceed in the matter independently as it is sub-judice.

In its judgment, the court had said that if a school is prescribing books from private publishers, they should be at par with the NCERT books in terms of quality and cost. Schools cannot prescribe books from private publishers which cost more than NCERT books.

After receiving several complaints from the parents, education minister Arvind Pandey constituted nodal officers in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to survey all the private schools in their respective districts and identify the defaulters.

The officers found 186 out of 226 private schools in violation of the high court order.

""The schools have been trying to defend themselves by saying that the books by private publishers are for their library but it is baseless. If these books are for the library, then why have the parents been made to buy them in addition to the NCERT books? This has led to extra financial burden on the parents,"" Tiwari said.

Deputy director, primary education, Jitendra Saxena, said: ""We have served notices to these schools on the basis of nine points. The schools are supposed to display the rates of the books on their websites but most of them have not done so. Many don't even have a website."""

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint.

Homework

B.R. Supreeth, office-bearer of the Management of Independent CBSE Schools, said schools had evolved homework to ensure it was only a recap of the things learnt in the classroom. ""Teachers do not ask students to write impositions like how they used to do earlier. We give meaningful homework that supplements classroom learning.

Mr. Shashi Kumar said it was not practical for all schools to have a locker facility for students. ""The department can recommend that schools have lockers so that students can keep their belongings. But this cannot be imposed on budget private schools,"" he said.

He said the government had not considered their inputs before evolving various policies. School managements are willing to implement no bag day once a month, he added. He urged the department to declare second Saturday as holiday for students so that they get time to spend with their family.

CM's intervention sought

Private school managements sought the Chief Minister's intervention, claiming that Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh was not available to listen to their grievances.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We are all now complying with the fee structure and all our member schools will display it from December.""

He said the move aims to bring in accountability and transparency. This has been the long-standing demand of parents. Schools that do not comply with the fee structure can be penalised up to ₹10 lakh.

For several years, school managements have been violating the fee structure policy, terming it ""archaic"".

The students of government schools, who come from lower socio-economic strata, are relatively less vulnerable to get these diseases, the study conducted by researchers from AIIMS, Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Institute of Health Management and Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says. It has been published in Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR).

The research involved screening of 1369, 786 boys and 543 girls -- studying in grades II and XI in 10 randmly selected private schools and nine government schools.

The percentage of overweight and obese students among private schools was 13% and 9% respectively. Among the government school students, only 3% students were found to be overweight and none of them were found to be obese. Number of underweight students in government schools was, however, noted to be three times that of the private school students.

Hypertension and bad cholesterol, risk factors usually associated with increasing age and unhealthy lifestyle, was also found to be affecting the students.

In the study, the prevalence of hypertensive students in private schools was 13% and in government schools it was 4.5%. Monika Arora, the lead author of the study told TOI, this is the first research to report on the distribution of multiple risk factors for NCDs in school students in India, comparing low socio-economic status (government schools) to high socio-economic status (private schools).

""Private school students had 29 times the prevalence of obese students compared to government schools,"" she said. Arora blamed sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating for the increased risk and stressed on the need for comprehensive, school-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyle among them.

Harvard School of Public Health has, in a study on economic losses due to non-communicable diseases, has estimated the economic burden of these ailments for India will be close to $6.2 trillion for 2012-30, a figure that is nearly nine times the total health expenditure during the previous 19 years of $710 billion."

High demand for admissions

Despite there being 35 private schools in the district, parents seem to prefer the Zilla Parishad High School in Bakhalwada colony. Unable to handle the number of applications for admission, this school has put up a ""no admissions"" board at the entrance. In the last few years, admissions get filled within the first week of June in this school. The High School has 796 students studying between classes 6 and 10 who are accommodated in 35 classrooms. There are two sections for Telugu students and three for English in each class. The school has 46 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching staff, a library, science lab and playground apart from other facilities. ""Last three years, we secured 100 per cent pass in Class-X examinations,"" says the school headmaster Banda Venkat Reddy. While the school is 'almost perfect' the headmaster has urged the government to construct a kitchen where midday meals can be cooked.

'Train' them for future!

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders! Every since the boring school became a 'train school' dropout rates have frozen, say authorities. Also, they are seeing a sudden jump in attendance rate. Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train. ""At present, we have 270 students coming from Kancherla, Maddimall and Veernapalli villages. Since the makeover, donations have increased and we used this amount to hire two additional teachers,"" says the school headmaster Bukya Gajan. It's not just students, the school has also become a local tourist attraction with people visiting the spot to take selfies.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

Nizam-era Telugu medium school still going strong

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

Several Private schools in Delhi have decided not to celebrate the Teachers' Day on September 5. A few of those are likely to observe a muted celebrations. The private schools have taken this decision citing ""spate of arrests"" of teachers and principals in the national capital. The school authorities also alleged that they were treated in poor, unfair manner. An association of over 160 senior secondary private schools, The National Progressive Schools' Conference (NPSC), has reportedly issued an advisory to schools.

The Affordable Private Schools' Association has also decided not to celebrate Teachers' Day on September 5. ""We, the educationist fraternity, have to restore the value in our society and respect of the teachers, so that we can bring trust in the system,"" it said in a statement. Earlier on August 21, the Springdales Education Society had sent a note stating it will not be hosting the Teachers' Day dinner this year.

The Springdales Education Society circular said this is ""owing to a series of disturbing events in schools, in and outside Delhi, where principals and teachers have been held accountable for situations that in many instances have not been the responsibility of schools and their management"". ""Teachers are being targeted on unproven allegations of a lack of safety of school children. The relationship between the school and parents, too, is merely transactional and not what we desire it to be or what it used to be,"" it said.

Two teachers and the principal of a school were arrested after a Class IX student allegedly committed suicide. Parents had accused teacher and the school of harassing the student.

Earlier in April, the National Coalition for School Education (NCSE) had demanded reforms in education, including amendment to the Right to Education Act. Speaking to reporters, NCSE chairman Kulbhushan Sharma said, ""While the state of education calls for urgent reform, the government seems to be working only for appeasement and quick fix."" ""Amendments needs to be made to RTE legislation for learning outcome-based school recognition system instead of mere infrastructure-based norms, which have led thousands of schools to close down,"" Sharma said."

A survey that assessed students across 20 states revealed that 9 in 10 children in urban private schools cannot read in English.

The report, 'Where India reads 2017-18', covered 19,765 children of classes IV, V and VI in 106 private schools in cities, across 20 states, including Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir among others.

The survey conducted by Stones2Milestones, an organisation that aims to address the reading and learning levels of school going students. This was reviewed by Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER).

The report suggests that problem lies within our households. ""English is a second or even third language, in several Indian households and children speak in their mother tongue which is either Hindi or a regional language. However, at school they are expected to learn a language which is foreign to them, in a formal setting.""

Nikhil Saraf, co-founder, Stones2Milestones, said, ""The test was conducted online to check comprehension, vocabulary and reading habits of students under their teachers' supervision. Some students answered a few test items in an unreasonably short time. Since it is unlikely for a small child to read and respond in snap of a finger, we did not count for scoring.""

""This also points to several behavioural peculiarities, which could include reading fatigue, non-seriousness and bad monitoring practices.""

The schools were provided with a list of suggestions and actions needed to improve reading levels based on the assessment report.

""The focus should be to make reading to the core as a learning focus rather than just restrict it to a namesake library period,"" said Kavish Gadia, co-founder and CEO, Stones2Milestones.

Christel R Devadaswon, head, Department of English, University of Delhi, said, ""A policy is required to improve the literacy rate and stakeholders should look at the perspective of children and their socioeconomic situations.""

Venita Kaul, ex-senior education specialist and chairperson of the Advisory Committee of Center for Early Childhood Education and Development (CECED), said, ""I hope this report will initiate a discussion on challenges many Indian children face due to multi-lingual environment at home. It will sensitise parents, teachers and other stakeholders regarding the need to revisit classroom pedagogy for teaching reading to children. This is an urgent need in primary schools since children learn best in ways more developmentally and contextually appropriate for them. Once that is done, future assessments of children's reading skills will undoubtedly present a more favourable picture of their reading levels."""

These are some of the facts that were presented by two development researchers in a presentation titled ""How do Households Finance Private School Education?"" in an international conference on public policy and management organised by IIM, Bengaluru in New Delhi recently.

""We set out to analyse the financing patterns of private education by families because it's a common experience that even urban poor and low-income families in rural areas now prefer private schools over government schools,"" said Nishant Chadha of India Development Foundation, a researcher.

""And the findings so far, I would say, have been startling as families cut their other expenses significantly to ensure things like tuition, uniforms and recurrent fee that private schooling demands.""

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees.

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food.

A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards. Experts who are a part of the initiative have come up with a great curriculum,"" said Tawde."

The announcement from the Aadhaar issuing body came in the backdrop of the start of admission process in Nursery and entry-level classes in over 1,500 private schools in the national capital. As per media reports, several schools are insisting parents to submit their Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admissions.

Speaking about the same with news agency PTI, UIDAI chief Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said that the department is aware about the fact that some private schools are demanding Aadhaar cards for admission of students. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey told the news agency.

The UIDAI has also warned the school administration to make sure that none of the students are denied admission for not providing Aadhaar as admission document. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" Pandey said.

The Supreme Court, in September this year, upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and stated that it would remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN). However, the top court also mentioned that the 12-digital unique identification number will not be mandatory for opening bank accounts, mobile connections and school admissions.

The apex court's directive also stated that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

""A grievance cell will be made functional where parents can lodge complaints against schools denying admissions or violating the RTE Act.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

An endless debate rages in the education sector over whether school education ought to be run solely by the state or allowed to move into private hands.

Though a host of individuals, experts and organisations strongly favour a state-run education system, the fact is that state schools all over the world, including India, have witnessed a steady outflow of children to the private school system.

Apparently, the poor didn't know the value of education and used their children as labour.

This debate should have died after the 1991 liberalisation when poor parents woke up and became eager to send their children to English medium schools. Was this treated as good news? Not really, for the elites found something else to complain about.

The poor wanted schools, but couldn't find any. Many primary schools that had supposedly been ""built"" by government in remote villages simply didn't exist: that money had long evaporated through corruption. Where the poor did have a local primary school, it was dilapidated and its appointed teachers didn't even come to the school. And in the few cases where the teachers did come, the parents found the teachers to be hopelessly incompetent. Not a surprise since most of them have bribed their way into the job.

And so, as Gurcharan Das has said, India grows at night. Where the government fails, private enterprise steps in to retrieve the situation and bring in a modicum of development. That's what happened in the school sector. To meet this huge demand, private for-profit low-cost schools sprung up like mushrooms. These were not perfect by any stretch of imagination but they were vastly superior to the non-existent or even the average government ""school"", as Tooley's diligent research has shown.

When this happened, the elites moved their goalpost and started complaining against these private schools. Anurag Behar's recent article in Live Mint is a case in point. No matter the poor do, India's elites will always find something wrong with them.

The elites are now demanding a huge increase in government management and funding in the school sector. Apparently, it was not enough for the government to have failed totally and comprehensively for 70 years. Our only saviour is our government once again, headed by criminals who appoint teachers through bribes and who pocket the taxes allocated for school infrastructure. According to our elites, the private sector is nothing but a pain in the neck and must be sidelined.

In my view there are two explanations for this inexplicable view by people like Mr Behar. Either these elites are grossly ill-informed or they have a hidden agenda. Is it possible that not being capable of delivering better low-cost schools that poor parents will pay for, in the face of cut-throat competition, elite NGOs are bagging their competition in order to grab government subsidies?

But let me take a more charitable perspective, which turns out to be possibly worse in some ways. I suspect the real explanation is that these elites have a strong ideological belief in socialism which has made them blind to the blatant crimes and corruption of government, even where the evidence is right in front of their nose.

In India we pay twice for everything: first we pay the government, and then, after it has failed, we pay a second time, to the private sector, to finally get the job done, with whatever money we still have left in our pocket.

The elites must surely realise that nothing concentrates the mind more than poverty. Even the slightest expenditure the poor make must pass the most stringent tests. That poor parents are choosing to pay twice for their children's education tells that something is seriously wrong with the government system. To suggest that such poor people are stupid and gullible is to discount what they are trying to tell us: Stop looting us and let us free.

We know from Tooley's research (and I have some personal direct evidence that I'll mention some other day in another context) that these parents are actively monitoring the performance of their children. And to ensure that these parents' don't move their child to another school, the school owners are constantly monitoring the performance of the teachers. The incentives align perfectly.

Of course, these schools have poor infrastructure - but that's all the poor can pay for. This, however, is not the pivotal issue. Gandhi rightly told us that it is not school infrastructure but the teacher that matters most. We need teachers who actually come to teach. And second, that these teachers are at least moderately competent.

It is unfortunate that an institution named after one of India's greatest entrepreneurs, Aziz Premji, has such a dim view about perhaps the greatest example of entrepreneurship in the world - the low cost for-profit private schools of India.

Good policy can't be made by assuming a role for government. It must begin by understanding any market failure and doing the best to support the market to overcome any such failure. Today there is a real market in school education in India with very little market failure. All we need is to support these schools through school vouchers for the poorest of the poor. Indeed, that's our party's policy.

One last point. Mr Behar points out that teachers in such schools are paid below the minimum wage. Our party rejects the very concept of minimum wage which is both theoretically and practically proven to harm the poorest of the poor. Our party will abolish minimum wage laws. Instead of seeing this as a problem, I suggest that Mr Behar celebrate the vast employment that these schools have generated and how well they are serving a genuine need to the best of their ability - despite total government antipathy.

It is not that these teachers are underpaid. Instead, teachers in government schools are grossly overpaid. In a private competitive system, teachers would all receive their marginal product. Better teachers would be paid vastly more than any teacher is paid today."

This is in violation with the policy on Karnataka Educational Institutions (Regulation of Certain Fees and Donations) (Amendment) Rules 2018, which has been in force mandating the schools to stick to the calendar of events released by the Department of Public Instruction for admission.

The issue has gone viral on social media platforms, where parents have formed groups alleging that schools are charging up to '1,000 as fee per application form without confirming a seat.

This reporter from The New Indian Express visited some schools on Friday posing as a parent seeking admission and was shocked to learn that some schools have even closed the admission process for the next academic year.

Authorities of one such school located in South Bengaluru, offering both CBSE and ICSE syllabus, said, ""You are too late. We have already finished issuing applications for the next academic year and seats will also be announced soon.""

Another prime school, also located in Bengaluru South, issued the application form, but said they cannot assure a seat as they have already received application forms in excess of the seats available. ""We cannot assure you the seat. We are already flooded with applications. You will have to try your luck. If someone surrenders their seat, you may get a chance,"" said a front office staff member.

So blatant is this malpractice in the background of the sheer lack of regulation or enforcement of rules that some schools have even dared to publish their commencement of admission process for academic year 2019-20 on their official websites without fear of reprisals.

Shilpa Prashanth, a South Bengaluru parent said, ""I was looking for admission of my son at one of the prime schools in our locality, but I was surprised to hear that I was too late. Although I approached them in mid-October, the school had already closed the admission process.""

Another parent said, ""I took applications for my son from three main schools in West Bengaluru, but of the three, one school said they cannot promise a seat, while another demanded full payment of fees up front, now itself. So, I have decided to wait for communication from the third school.""

Moreover, some of the schools which are confirming the seats while collecting advance fees to block the seats, are refraining from giving a receipt to the parents in return for the payment. ""We have to agree at the risk of losing the amount as the schools are not giving receipts. But, as it is hard to get seats in these schools, we are being forced to agree and accept whatever the conditions laid down by the schools,"" said one desperate parent.

Paying heavy price for education

Scared to file plaint

Although the District Education Regulatory Authority (DERA) is active, parents do not dare to file complaints as they are worried that such an act would affect their child's prospects in getting a seat

According to the Karnataka Education Act, the schools established in the state are not allowed to start admissions for the next academic year until the state department of public instructions releases the calendar of events

Normally, the calendar is released in the end of April or first week of May

It can be recalled that when Tanveer Sait was the primary and secondary education minister, he had directed his department officials to quash all such ""early admissions"" and declare them illegal"

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

The Association while condemning the move said that the certain lobby in administration and few other quarters who in one way or other are trying to destroy the fledgling private education sector in Kashmir.

G N Var, chairman PSAJK said that Legal Metrology Department, Directorate of School Education, Fee Fixation Committee, district administration and everybody who wields some sort of power are swooping down on small private schools to harass them.

""Today running a private school has become a herculean task. With mudslinging, barrage of allegations and character assassinations, private schools are being labelled as some kind of criminals,"" he said.

War said incidentally, there is no rule which specifically says that schools cannot keep books in their schools for sale.

CBSE had asked all affiliated schools to upload transfer certificates (TC) issued to students after completion of Std IX or XI, but almost all private schools have continued to ignore the diktat. The 2014 decision was taken so that students seeking admission to Std X or XII do not face delays just because their TC from previous school could not be verified. It was in the same year that CBSE's rule of counter-signature of TCs from school to the other was scrapped.

CBSE wrote to schools a few weeks ago saying that many schools are not following the rule even though it is mandatory.

In the post-2014 scenario, CBSE simplified the Std X and XII admission process by asking the new schools to simply verify the student's TC from his previous school's web site and complete the admission formalities.

It is now a well-known fact that many schools force parents to buy books and uniforms only from a particular shop. This way they earn some extra money from the sale of the books and uniforms which in turn are sold to parents at an exorbitant cost. A prominent missionary school in Baramulla was recently fined for selling textbooks through a single bookshop only. But the menace is not confined to a single school only. Many elite schools in the Valley themselves sell these books but no action has so far been taken against them. It is thus necessary that the action against schools shouldn't be initiated on a selective basis.

Also, forays into commercial activities isn't only thing that is wrong with the private schools: their arbitrary fee structure and for that matter the quality of their teaching itself is a great cause of concern. What is needed, therefore, is not only the regulation of their commercial activities and the fee structure but a comprehensive look at the whole system of private schooling in the state. The objective should not be more regulation of these schools but to ensure that they deliver quality education for which they charge heavily. Kashmir has witnessed an unprecedented growth of private schools and most of these lack infrastructure and adequately qualified staff. And even with schools which have the infrastructure, the quality of education is pits.

Private schools have tried to act as more disciplined and rigorous academic counterparts of the Government schools: regular class work, less holidays and more extra-curricular activities have been their hallmark. But so far as quality of education is concerned, there is little that sets them apart. They charge heavy fees from the parents and compensate it not by imparting good quality education but by showing off some style: bright uniforms and more extra-curricular activities. Education in these schools is about stage-management: loaded satchels, excessive homework and an endless supply of stationary which in turn is cleverly bound up with the business part of running a school.

The aspect of the school which gets least attention is the education, which in turn boils down to the recruitment of good teachers. The schools hire the disaffected educated youth who are willing to work for a pittance as a prelude to a much sought-after permanent government job. And most of them miserably lack the depth of knowledge to be good teachers. This malaise afflicts our educational system right through - from primary schools to the universities. Surprisingly, some of the franchise schools which have forayed into Valley in recent years are similarly afflicted: a large, imposing infrastructure but little depth in the all-important tuition part of their functioning. Even though, it is equally the job of parents to see that these schools provide the quality education they seek for their wards, government can help by forcing these institutions to pay well to the teachers which in turn will attract better talent."

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Nov. 3 : A legislator has noted reports that are implied to be practices of subtle discrimination in private institutions. Some of these include priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to 'weak' students; or schools asking parents to deposit money, which are not returned unless their wards improve in performance.

The advisor was addressing the 25th anniversary of the All Nagaland Private Schools Association, Dimapur unit (ANSPA) at the Dimapur District Sports Council which was packed with students, teachers, and guests on November 3 to celebrate the silver jubilee.

The advisor for School Education, K Tokugha Sukhalu, attended the occasion as its main guest. He said that the private schools were performing better than the government institutions in terms of discipline, culture and accountability. While Dimapur is comparatively better than the rest of the districts, he said, there is very less space for outdoor activities though. He said learning methods are changing and the ANSPA should be able to manage trained personnel so that children are equipped with proper skills. He appealed to the teachers to ensure that courses are completed in time and ensure children are taught properly.

However, the advisor pointed out some of negative reports that reportedly were doing the rounds with regard to private educational institutions. These reports included alleged priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to weak students; reputed schools asking parents to deposit money and unless the children improve, funds are reportedly not returned.

At these, he asked the teachers to be proud of their students no matter what 'background difference' there may be. One cannot compare students based on their educational backgrounds and ""you never know the brightest students may lose tomorrow,"" he said. Institutions should not be only for profit-making but to ensure that students are nurtured to be the leaders of future, he reminded.

Enrolment in private institutions is increasing whereas enrolment in government institutions is decreasing. So, the responsibility is huge for the ANSPA, Sukhalu remarked. He added that students are the future and urged the children to pledge to be the ""leaders of tomorrow.""

The director of the Central Board of School Education at Guwahati, KK choudhury, also addressed the event. He said that ""Nagaland is a big contributor to the literacy rate of the country with 80.11%.""

In this changing scenario, non-conventional subjects are getting importance and employment opportunities are being widened. Almost 90% of job opportunities are available in the unorganised sector, he said. The official encouraged the gathering to embrace technology and incorporate the knowledge in their field. Further, he said that the Northeast region contributes greatly to the cultural and natural resources of the country."

The list available with the state department of public instructions, provided by the Deputy Directors of Public Instructions (DDPI), indicates that over 50 private schools affiliated to various boards have violated the act and are not introducing Kannada as their first or second language.

Following the recommendations by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), the state government had decided to make Kannada a compulsory subject (first or second language) at all the schools functioning in the state, irrespective of the board they follow, and the same had been implemented from the academic year 2018-19. But, even six months after the commencement of the academic year, some schools have been found violating the rule.

When the state government took this decision, several private schools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE boards had raised an objection. But, later as it became a state policy, the schools were forced to implement it.

Recently, the Kannada Development Authority received complaints against some of the schools alleging that they were not following the said rule. Based on the complaints, KDA chairperson Prof SG Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the state department of primary and secondary education to submit a report.

""Following the letter received from the KDA chairperson, we have instructed our DDPIs to visit the schools across the state and submit a report about the alleged violation. For some of the districts, we have yet to get the report,"" said Basavaraja, director of primary education department.

He said the department would initiate an action against such schools soon by first issuing notices as per the process. ""Once we get the report from all the districts we will issue notices to school managements which are violating the Compulsory Kannada rule,"" Basavaraja said.

The KDA authorities, on their part, have directed the primary and secondary education department to initiate action to disaffiliate such schools. Prof Siddaramaiah said, ""I have written a letter to the education department about the violation of the act by some of the private schools and have asked them to submit action taken report. But till date we have not received a reply from them. The department must take measures immediately to disaffiliate such schools.""

However, the rule framed by the department has no provisions to disaffiliate violating schools. As per the rules, the department can only levy a penalty of '500 on such schools in the first year."

Take the case of a 40-year-old single mother, who earns no more than Rs 4,000 a month. She said her excitement at her daughter getting enrolled in a private school in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar was short-lived as she was forced to then spend money on her books, uniform and stationery. ""My daughter was admitted to Anglo Indian Public School in Class 1, under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, this year. We were told we would get everything for free, as per the RTE (Act). But so far, nothing has been provided. I have spent nearly Rs 8,000 on her books, stationery, and uniform,"" the woman said, requesting anonymity. She said she had the bills for items worth Rs 7,900.

The woman said she was concerned about paying for her daughter's winter uniform, which would cost at least Rs 3,000.

Officials at Anglo Indian Public School said they had been unable to provide free uniforms and stationery items because they had not yet received any funds from the government. Chander Singh, a spokesperson for the school, said: ""Last year too, we received only Rs 1,125 per student. How can this amount cover books, uniform and stationery items and examination fees?""

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25 % of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and first standard -- are to be reserved for children whose parents earn less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.

At present, the Delhi government is supposed to reimburse Rs 1,100 per student for uniforms and another Rs 2,200 for books, stationery, tuition and exam fees.

HT is in possession of at least 100 complaints, written by families who claim they have been deprived of the free study material and uniforms by private schools.

""We have received hundreds of complaints from parents whose children are not provided anything by private schools. We had forwarded all the complaints to the education minister's office but to no avail,"" Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working for EWS children in Delhi, said.

Debate over funds

In 2013, a group of private schools had moved the Delhi high court claiming that the amount paid by the state government per child was too low to meet all expenses. The court, in 2014, directed private schools to provide books, stationery items and uniforms to students under the EWS/DG categories, and said it was the responsibility of both the government and the schools to ensure free education to these students. The matter is still subjudice. Even as the Delhi high court issued as many as 46 reminders to private schools between April 2014 and September 2018 to provide the required materials, parents claim they have still not received anything.

Most of the private schools this correspondent contacted declined to comment, saying the matter was subjudice.

Kamal Gupta, counsellor, Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools in Delhi, a body representing 450 private schools said half the schools have not received any funds from the government.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's education department -- Directorate of Education (DoE) -- said it already provided funds to the private schools and was requesting the government for ""additional funds"" to meet the revised estimates. The government, this year, increased the reimbursement amount by Rs 600.

""Whatever demand is pending for this year will be fully met by end-November. However, the delayed release of funds cannot be the reason for private schools not giving books and uniforms to the students,"" he said. Goel said the DoE had also issued multiple notices to many schools and warned they would de-recognise them if they did not provide books and uniforms.

Parents bear costs

Another parent, requesting anonymity, said two of his children were not given uniforms by a private school in north Delhi. ""My children got admission in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category this year. The school had given them used books but not uniforms and stationery. I had to buy those myself,"" said the man, who works in a grocery shop and earns Rs 5,000 a month.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate representing families in Delhi high court, said, ""There is no provision under which the parents can claim reimbursements once they spend the money on these things. They can only be issued a fresh set of uniforms or books once the schools get the money.""

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

According to records of the Directorate of Education (DoE) , of the 48,122 seats reserved under the so-called economically weaker section or EWS category in private schools at the entry level, only 35,500 seats have been filled. And according to a recent report submitted by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to the DoE, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

The schools have given a variety of reasons for refusing admission: no vacancies; the school being too far from the home of the child seeking admission; or that even general category seats are yet to be filled. The sixth round of admissions is still underway.

In some cases, parents this correspondent interviewed alleged that private schools denied admission to their wards even after their names appeared in the selected lists. DoE's response to this is that many such families do not report for admission even after the names have come up in the draw of lots and the selected names are displayed on the DoE website. DoE, which comes under the state government's education department, releases the list of selected candidates.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said, ""All these seats are vacant in less popular schools. Parents are not interested in getting their kids enrolled there. We have issued multiple notices to the schools after receiving complaints from parents. We have also sent our officials in many schools for inspection and found that parents did not report there.""

One parent says he and his ward reported and were turned away. ""I have been making rounds to Panchsheel Public School in Badarpur since March for the admission of my six-year-old son. His name appeared for admission in Class I in the first list. However, we were told that there was no vacancy and we would be called by the school when all the general seats are filled.

He has been applying to enrol his son in a private school under the EWS category for the last three years.

""He will exceed the age limit if he does not get admission this year,"" said Ahmed. Children over the age of six are not eligible for entry-level admission in the EWS category.

Officials at Panchsheel Public School said there are no seats on offer. ""We had only one vacancy for class I this year and we had informed the DoE about it. We do not have any vacant seat,"" said Bharti Mehta, principal of the school.

Similarly, Shiv Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Mehrauli, said his four-year-old son was denied admission in Deep Public School in Vasant Kunj. ""I was not even given a proper reason for the denial. An official said that there was no vacancy,"" he claimed Officials at the school, however, denied the charges saying that all students whose names appeared in the list were given admission.

Still, there are some instances where the children have not reported for admission. This reporter met some families which did not report for admission to the schools. Many said the school was far from home. ""I stay in north Delhi's Samaipur Badli and my four-year-old was assigned three schools in Dwarka, which is at the distance of 20 km from our house. How can we enrol our little one there?"" asked Jyoti Kumari, a homemaker.

As per norms, children must be assigned schools within 3km range of their residence for entry level classes.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of seats are to be reserved for the EWS category in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools. Despite receiving over 100,000 applications every year, thousands of seats go vacant. As per the affidavits submitted by DoE in the Delhi high court, copies of which are with Hindustan Times, of 48,122 available EWS seats in private schools in Delhi, only 20,000 and 19,000 were filled in the last two academic sessions, 2017-18 and 2016-17, respectively.

DoE said it has set the target of filling at least 40,000 seats this year. ""We are yet to complete the final round of admission and hoping to fill over 40,000 seats this year,"" Goel said.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate in the Delhi high court said he has filed as many as 50 individual cases on behalf of the parents denied admission this academic session. ""This is a failure of DoE.

Ahead of the new academic session, parents have expressed resentment against excessive tuition and admission fee charged by various private schools.

The parents have also accused Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) of not taking action against some schools despite repeated complaints. The allegations come in the wake of de-recognition of two private schools by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) for charging exorbitant fee.

Parents who have admitted their wards in Iqbal Memorial Institute (IMI) Bemina claimed that they had complained about the extra money charged by the school several times, but the Fee Fixation Committee didn't show any interest to address the issue.

""I admitted my son in the year 2015 and that time they charged me Rs 35,000 as admission fee. Presently the school is charging extra Rs 3900 as annual charges,"" said one of the parents wishing not to be identified.

""Earlier the school was charging Rs 2000 as monthly fee but after the FFC recommended them to charge just Rs 1890, the school adhered to the direction. Now again they are charging Rs 250 extra as computer fee and I am paying Rs 2150 a month including computer charges,"" he added.

Similarly, parents of those students who have admitted their kids in Kashmir Harvard Habak, complained that the school charged Rs 80,000 as admission fee besides charging Rs 3400 as monthly fee including transport charges.

One of the parents said that he admitted his daughter a few weeks late in the school and the authorities charged him extra money, saying that the school has increased the tuition fee.

""I am paying Rs 1500 for the 2nd standard student and more than Rs 1300 for 4th standard,"" he said.

Pertinently, the FFC has recommended Rs 1320 for 2nd standard.

Parents of those students, who have admitted their wards in Presentation Convent School, said they have paid Rs 70,000 as admission fee.

The parents also said that the tuition fee for a year is included in the admission fee.

According to one of the parents, who has admitted her ward in Presentation Convent Srinagar, in summers the school charges Rs 5090 as tuition fee for three months excluding transportation fee which is Rs 1500 per month.

""For winters the school is charging Rs 9120 tuition fee for three months which means we have are paying Rs 3040 per month excluding transportation charges,"" she said.

Similarly, as per sources Burn Hall School Srinagar also charges Rs 80,000 as admission fee.

""The admission fee is merely meant for the admissions; no tuition fee is included in admission fee.""

According to parents, the school charges Rs 2800 as monthly tuition fee in winters and over Rs 2600 in summers.

""In winters we are paying Rs 8,600 as tuition fee for three months excluding transport fee which is Rs 4800 and for the summers we are paying above Rs 8,000 excluding transport fee.""

According to the FFC, the school is supposed to charge Rs 1890 for first standard to 10th standard and Rs 2390 for 11th and 12th standard.

The FFC order (No 262-FFC of 2018 dated 21-02-2018) has clearly mentioned that the school shall not charge any other kind of fee unless a prior permission for the same is obtained.

Parents said Delhi Public School (DPS) Srinagar is charging Rs 1.10 lakh as admission fee.

One of the parents, Tahir Ahmad Dar (name changed) said his ward is studying in UKG and the school authorities are charging Rs 2750 as monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 monthly bus fee.

His two other kids are studying in 8th standard and 5th standard and he is paying Rs 4250 monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 bus fee for both classes.

According to FFC, the Linton Hall School in Rajbagh is supposed to charge Rs 1200 per month for the students of UKG to 10th standard as tuition fee.

However, top officials of FFC said they are they are charging Rs 1350 more as monthly tuition fee.

The FFC official said they have recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee for RP School, ""but they started charging Rs 1900 which also resulted in the suspension of its recognition"".

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora is charging Rs 83,000 as admission fee for the new entrants of nursery class and KG-I.

Sources told Rising Kashmir that the school has different charges for admission as the school is charging Rs 48,000 as admission fee for students getting admitted in 11th standard in which school is taking tuition fee from the admission fee for a year.

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora had been recommended Rs 2520 for KG-I, Rs 2140 for KG-II, Rs 1700 for the Ist class to 8th standard and Rs 1950 for the 9th and 10th standard.

For the 11th standard, the FFC allowed the school to charge Rs 3255 for medical students and Rs 3015 for Arts students and for 12th standard the school had been allowed to charge Rs 3580 for the medical students and Rs 3320 for Arts students.

The FFC official said the school was violating norms and will not reclaim recognition unless they adhere to its guidelines.

The parents of those wards who are studying in Foundation World School said they are being charged Rs 50,000 as admission fee.

Parent of one of the wards said, ""My kid is studying in the nursery class and I am paying Rs 8000 monthly fee including Rs 6000 tuition fee and Rs 2000 transport fee.""

Parents of those wards who are studying in GD Goenka Srinagar said the school charged Rs 1 lakh earlier for new admissions and Rs 7,000 as monthly fee including the bus charges.

Another parent whose two kids are studying in Biscoe School said he is paying Rs 2730 for 4th standard and Rs 2760 for 8th standard.

""Last year the admission fee was Rs 65,000 in which the school was offering one-year tuition fee and uniform charges as well. The school is giving proper receipt of admission fee which other private schools don't. They take fee draft,"" he said.

The Woodlands School Shivpora charges Rs 28,000 as admission fee for new entrants.

""They are charging Rs 3200 fee. The school charges transport fee according to the distance.""

Officials in FFC said they lack manpower and cannot monitor each and every private school.

""There are more than two thousand private schools in the valley and we don't have that much of manpower available with us. This committee was formed a few years back and it will take time to upgrade it,"" he said.

When contacted, the chairperson and officials of FFC did not respond to repeated calls and messages from this reporter.

Director School Education Kashmir, GN Itoo said the complaints against any school received by FFC are being taken seriously and necessary action will be taken immediately.

""Recently FFC has issued a circular in which they have asked all private schools to reveal their current fee structure, admission fee and transportation fee as well and once they will get the details from schools, it will be decided by DSEK as to what should be done with the violators,"" he said.

Itoo further said the FFC has sought help from DSEK also. ""And we have assured them that nodal officers from CEO office will help them at the district level.""

years of 2016-17 and 2017-18, an analysis has shown.

The analysis, commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), was carried out by Indus Action, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) working towards implementation of Section 12(1)(C) of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clause mandates that private, unaided schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats in entry-level classes for EWS/DG category students.

The data for the analysis was obtained from the Directorate of Education (DoE).

According to the report filed by the NGO, 48 private schools did not admit any student under the quota in 2016-17 while seven schools registered no admissions under the category in 2017-18. Additionally, about 19 private schools did not admit a single child in both years.

""One of the things asked by the DCPCR to the NGO was to analyse and list the schools who had not given admission to a single child under the quota despite allotment of the seats with them,"" member of DCPCR Anurag Kundu said.

The commission has asked for the phone number of parents allotted seats under the quota, along with reasons recorded by these schools for not admitting them from the DoE.

""All this has been requested to corroborate the claims, by both parents and the school... and to find what the truth is and then initiate an enquiry accordingly,"" Kundu added.

The DoE was not available for comment when approached by the Sunday Standard.

""Private schools are primarily are not interested in giving admissions to children belonging to the EWS and DG category. The improper monitoring by the education department has further given them

leverage to deny admission,"" said Advocate and social activist Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist which fights for people belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group.

""The purpose of carrying the analysis was to send show cause notice to such private schools. It appeared some of these schools in Delhi outrightly denied. Some cited 1:3 rule and others cited invalidity of income or caste certificates as reasons for not admitting children under the reservation,"" Tushar Bhadwar of Indus

Action said."

Apart from the backbreaking process of admissions, the money deposited as 'admission fee' is not even tax-free.

With passing years, the government taxes are only increasing in the valley. From eateries to earnings to the money people spend, everything comes with a tax. ""For what we have, we can pay the taxes. But for what we already spent, how can they ask for tax?"" asks a parent Tawheed Ahmad who recently got his kin admitted in a reputed private school in Srinagar.

After a baby is born, one looks at its face and thinks about the number of classes he/she has to study. People wait for the baby to start talking so that they can send them to a playschool where they can learn alphabets, rhymes, words, numbers, puzzles, games, colours and how to talk in English. This time is 'crucial' for the child as it will decide whether the child can get admitted in a reputed school or not.

""We tried to teach our child at home but in a play school, they learn discipline and exactly the things that will be asked in their interview,"" says Ahmad.

Ahmad had sent his ward to a playschool at the age of 3. ""He would still be sleeping when we would wake him up. He would cry a lot before leaving for the playschool. He would sleep for hours after coming back. This is the necessity of time,"" he explains adding that he had to pay around Rs. 2000 per month as the fees of the playschool for 2 years.

As soon as the news about the availability of school forms came, Ahmad and his wife like thousands of other parents in Kashmir ran to schools in the middle of the night, lining in a queue to grab a form.

""We went to many schools. I sent my brother to some places, me and my wife went to Tyndale Biscoe School. It was around 3 in the morning. There were already 3-4 parents waiting outside the school. We waited and waited. We had taken Namkeen Chai with us. We had breakfast on the road and finally the gate opened,"" he recalls.

After submitting the form, he says, the family would be after the child, asking him all sorts of questions like, ""What is your name, What is your father's name? What is your mother's name? Etc.""

All's well that ends well. The child gets admitted into the school. But that is not the end of the story. For admission in a government school, at the pre-Nursery level, one has to pay nothing.

""We had started saving even before he was born. But, even that is somehow not enough as we have to pay taxes for the amount of money we pay as admission fees. While paying the taxes on our earnings, we can only show the receipt of the tuition fees,"" says Tawheed.

""It has been going on for years. This is exploitation. First, the schools suck our blood and then the government,"" he adds.

A Chartered Accountant from the valley says, ""We as CA's do not go into the reasoning part of the laws. It is the forte of the lawmakers who draft these laws. I think only the tuition fee is considered as the admission fees is usually hefty. If they, exempt the admission fees, their tax revenue will go down. Also, they frame the policies considering who can and cannot pay taxes.""

School owners and even principals feel this should be a voluntary exercise as almost every student in such schools is already following a proper vaccination schedule through their private paediatrician.

While no one wanted to speak officially, schools felt that this mass vaccination should be optional. ""Parents themselves are vary of having their child take any kind of vaccination without their own doctor's supervision. And this tendency is not just limited to the upper middle or rich class now, because everyone has access to a paediatrician and regularly inoculate their children,"" said a school trustee.

Another trustee, who also owns a college, said that the mass vaccination programme is perfect for students in NMC and zilla parishad schools as 'they may not have access to private health care'. ""I fully support the government's initiative and it must focus on students who are normally deprived of such immunization programmes. I am sure there would even be private unaided schools in city whose students would be in need of this important vaccine, hence the best option would be for government to contact schools and seek parents' consent,"" he said.

Officials who are part of the immunization drive say there is no question of taking consent for this. Dr Mohd. Sajid, who's part of the core team looking after the drive in Nagpur, said, ""It's like chlorination of drinking water, no consent is necessary. Also it does not matter if child has taken two doses in advance, as this is as additional dose. In fact I have discussed this issue with a few schools and told them to inform parents, but there is no mention of parental consent even in the government guideline.""

He added that the drive must be viewed as a 'community level' health intervention. ""If even a single child is left behind then he could be a potential carrier of the virus,"" said Dr Sajid.

But a principal told TOI that getting consent from parents is crucial. ""Parents nowadays are very aware and aggressive when it comes to rights of their children, and we can't fault them for that. Already a handful of parents are approaching teachers and wanting to know if the school will allow the immunization programme. And I am sure by this month's end every single parent will be asking that question,"" she said. In April this year, almost 40 schools in Gurugram too refused to participate in it in the immunization drive, citing lack of consent of parents.

Paediatricians in city are already giving out MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) combo vaccination to children and it is part of the schedule chart too. A school principal said, ""Since private doctors are already giving the vaccine, I feel parents in top schools will keep their kids away from the mass vaccination drive."""

It's a turn off on a different level altogether when there is a national holiday and they are still supposed to attend classes.

Gandhi Jayanti, India's National Holiday is one such holiday for students of some private educational institutions in Kashmir. There is no alternative for them and the authorities despite knowing fail to address the issue.

While the government offices, educational institutions and banks stay closed today to celebrate Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's birthday, also celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence, some private educational institutions including Doon International (DIS), Presentation Convent (PCS), New Convent and Oasis School continue to work today. While students were called to DIS and PCS, in some other schools the teachers were called up to do the 'paperwork'.

""We received a message from the school yesterday informing that the school will remain closed on 1st October and that 2nd October will be a regular working day,"" says a parent who ward studies in DIS.

Adding, he asks, ""This is not the only time when they have opposed the government order. When the government declares summer or winter holidays, they make sure to stretch the working days by 10 to 15 days. Gandhi Jayanti is a National Holiday! If we are following all rules that Delhi frames, why not holidays?""

The parent had also approached the authorities once by lodging a complaint in Chief Minister's Grievance Cell regarding announcing of winter vacations in accordance with government orders. However, he says, ""Probably, the school has 'influences'. That is how they survive despite opposing the government orders.""

""They went there for inspection and still they closed the school after 3 days of the inspection. And guess what! No action was taken against them!"" he exclaims.

""Who are they to decide when to declare a holiday and when not to? My child would have really enjoyed the holiday at home. Now, this Jayanti makes no difference to her,"" he adds.

When asked why they keep opposing the norms, the Administrative In-charge DIS told Free Press Kashmir that the school had been closed on 1st October as a day before it had celebrated its Annual Day.

""We had celebrated our Annual Day a day before. The teachers and students were tired. So, we decided to keep Monday a holiday,"" said Mehnaz, Manager DIS. When told that the school cannot bend the rules as per their convenience, she says, ""This is for the first time that we have kept the school running on a National holiday. Otherwise, we frame out holidays as per the government order. This time, due to the Annual Day celebrations, the students had already missed classes. We needed to recover that as well.""

As far as other schools are concerned, the faculty says that they are called to school even if there is not much to do there.

""There are no students in the school. Still, we have been called to make lesson plans and do some paperwork,"" says a faculty member from Oasis School, on condition of anonymity.

""It's not that we don't want to work or that we only look for excuses to stay home. But, it's our right to stay home when there is a holiday,"" the teacher adds.

TRSMA had given a bandh call protesting against the State government's decision making it mandatory for the schools to obtain No Objection Certificates from fire department, traffic control and the corporation.

While parents criticised the move and called it a ploy by the schools to further pressurise the government from acting against them in their massive profiteering, teachers were unhappy that exam schedule had to be adjusted due to the bandh.

Glendale Academy, Chirec, Future Kids, Kalpa, Brilliant High School, Slate the School and Kennedy High the Global School were among the schools which were shut on Friday, either supporting the bandh call or declared holiday as a precautionary measure.

Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) condemned the bandh call for not just disrupting academic schedule but also involving the students in a fight that's not theirs.HSPA in a statement said that it was ""unbelievable... that a government which is supporting school managements on the gross violation of every single norm related to regulation of schools and fees charged would not be looking into these issues raised by schools.""

Given the mind-boggling scale of the demand, the private sector's participation is definitely a welcome move. India has one of the world's largest higher education systems, but it is still not adequate. Since 2003, India has apparently been adding more than 1,000 private colleges every year. Lacking in quality control, this expansion did not quite contribute to skill development or boost the nation's 'knowledge economy', and the private sector mostly remained the second-rate, fallback option for the desperate. As the number of 'educated' unemployed kept on growing, some of these teaching shops died their natural death.

In recent years, however, some old private brands have been re-inventing themselves, with fresh investments in quality faculty and research, scholarships and so on. The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent philanthropic interventions. More such interventions are needed for paradigm-shifting experimentation towards excellence, which the government often cannot risk as it spends taxpayers' money and is hence bound by safe rules. Students in Indian institutions have traditionally studied subjects in silos, as the system mostly did not allow for the multidisciplinary and int­erdisciplinary approach to learning.

The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent ­philanthropic ­interventions.

Realising much ahead of the herd that real problems need real solutions, the Shiv Nadar University started in 2011 with a multidisciplinary, 'liberal studies' curriculum, offering an excellent mix of science, engineering and social science teaching and research. One can't be a problem-solving engineer, for example, without understanding the social context. Similarly, policy-making on key iss­ues often needs to be science-driven -- a slightly expensive proposition, as cutting-edge science and technology research often needs heavy resources. But there cannot be any short-cuts if we wish to deliver what is needed.

Learning has to be curiosity-driven and enjoyable. The 'liberal studies' app­roach allows learners to experiment and find their passion. With the job market changing fast, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are key skills we need to impart. In the new institutions, curriculum content is dynamic and flexible, and the mode of delivery active or participatory, with students 'learning by doing'. Even undergraduate students are encouraged to grasp the nua­nces of research and innovation, while we stre­ngthen their foundation with a broad multidisciplinary approach and provide a depth of learning in a major subject.

And yet a growing number of fee-paying Indian students go abroad even at the undergraduate level -- the high cost is not a deterrent. While 'reputation management' is a serious issue, to build people's trust in India being a safe and welcoming country, we need to go for ser­ious accreditation and benchmarking of our institutions to make our country a higher-education destination. We need to hold all the institutions accountable in a transparent, fair and progressive manner. Private institutions have strong ­in-built internal accountability. We should bring in healthy competition to the public- and private-funded universities. Global rankings are one way, but their focus on uniformity of parameters may narrow the diversity that universities need for innovation in every sphere -- in strategy, curricula, pedagogy and research. We should find and retain some unique advantages of the Indian higher education system.

The country urgently needs a global and contextual vision plan, and a competent leadership with the necessary res­ources to carry the plan through. The system needs to be rebuilt with strong, equitable and credible partnerships -- national and international, academic and industrial, public and private -- bes­ides intra-institution (interdisciplinary) to inter-institution collaborations for inn­ovation and research excellence, capacity-­building and training the trainers, better teaching tools, enhancing students' employability, and connecting education to issues of livelihood and sustainability of future generations. This is the only way forward.

The UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath government on April 3, 2018, and signed by the governor on April 9. And on August 30, the ordinance was replaced with a law that was passed by a voice vote in the state assembly.

According to provisions of the Act, which covers all private CBSE, ICSE and state board-affiliated schools, all private schools that charge more than Rs 20,000 annually will have to revise their fee structure for all classes so as to bring down the financial burden on parents.

Moreover, admission fee can be charged only twice -- when a student joins school and after they complete Class X and seek admission for Class XI, according to the Act.

Schools also can't change uniform for five years. Fees charged by a school during 2015-16 will be the basis for implementing the regulation, the Act states.

Apart from the district magistrate, the committee will have a chartered accountant, a PWD executive engineer-rank official and a senior official from the UP State Finance and Accounts Services. It will also include a representative of parents association, a principal or manager of a self-financed school and the district inspector of schools.

Once the committee is set up in the district, officials said, it will address the complaints by parents regarding arbitrary fee hike and also work on putting a cap of the upper limits of fees that private schools can charge. Schools can be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh on first and second offence, respectively. Following this, it can be de-recognised.

""We have already written to the district magistrate to set up the district-level committee for Gautam Budh Nagar. Once the committee is formed, necessary action would be routed through it,"" district inspector of schools (DIOS) PK Upadhyaya said."

The private school managements, who have been asking the state to stop demanding fire, traffic and other NOCs (no objection certificates) for issuing ETR's (extension of temporary registrations), said the state cannot have different rules for private and government schools.

""If private schools have to submit NOCs from fire and traffic departments as well as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation for safety purposes, the same should also be implemented for government schools. They can't mandate something like this in the name of safety only for private schools. Also, these rules were formulated only a few years back, whereas many of these schools were established about 20-30 years ago. It is not fair to ask these schools to follow rules that are practically impossible to implement,"" said S Madhusudhan Reddy, president, TRSMA, Hyderabad, adding that all the 10,000 private schools in the state will participate in the bandh.

The managements of private schools said if the state wants schools to get these NOCs, every year about 600 schools will be forced to remain closed, which in turn will deprive economically backward students of the opportunity of a quality education.

They further said that the state cannot allocate the entire education budget only for students studying in government schools as it is their responsibility to provide free education to each and every student. ""When 55% of students are studying in private schools, it doesn't make any sense to allocate the entire budget only for students studying in government schools. Instead, they should give Rs 30,000 to each student through direct beneficiary transfer (DBT) and let the students and their parents opt for a school of their choice,"" said K Uma Maheswar Rao, general secretary, TRSMA.

The TRSMA members further demanded that state issue health cards to teachers of private schools and make them beneficiaries of 2BHK scheme of the government so that they have some basic security. They said if the state failed to meet their demands, they would intensify their protest and would announce their future course of action in the next few days."

The minister's statements put the schools in dilemma, forcing them to remain mum on the subject, even after most of them had informed the students and guardians in the morning about their decision to suspend classes or defer exams.

""Some private schools have decided to stay closed. We have already urged them to keep them open. I am again requesting them to keep the schools open. There is no need to worry.

Despite our requests, if they close their schools, we will not take any responsibility in any incident that may occur in their school.""

DPS Ruby Park and Ashok Hall Group of Schools have postponed their exams slated for Wednesday. While DPS Ruby Park called off classes for the primary section, Mahadevi Birla World Academy has suspended all the classes. ""We have no other option but to suspend classes because our school buses won't ply. We will postpone the practical examinations of senior school and call off the classes,"" said Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha. La Martiniere for Boys has advanced its dispersal timings.

As soon as the schools decided to postpone exams and suspend classes, Chatterjee issued a diktat to keep their schedule unchanged. The school authorities, however, declined to comment.

Chatterjee pointed out they might might be affiliated to ICSE or CBSE, but the schools had to take NOCs from the state. ""We have never interfered in any unfortunate incident, which had happened in some of the schools. They could have taken suggestions from the school education department. We have issued a circular to keep the schools open. Despite our requests, if some schools decide to defy our orders, we shall probe the activities of private schools affiliated to other boards, which we have not done till now,"" the minister said.

Further, the notice issued to the schools has directed them to submit the reply within a stipulated time period, or face action.

The HSVP had, on June 21, also issued directions that as per the allotment policy, the urban authority officials would be included in the management committee of the school to oversee the EWS admission process. It had nominated executive engineers Bhoop Singh and Rameshwar Das for schools falling under Estate Office 1, whereas executive engineers Shweta Sharma and Anil Kumar were appointed for those under Estate Office 2. Officials, however, have confirmed that none of the schools has included them in their committees. It is because of this reason that the HSVP has issued notices to 34 schools.

Earlier, the urban authority had taken similar action against three major private hospitals in the city asking them to furnish details of EWS patients treated by them as per the policy.

The recent gang rape of a girl in a Dehradun school has once again raised questions regarding safety and security of schoolchildren. Known for their quality of education, private schools in Uttarakhand attract students from all over the country. However, there are visible gaps in formation, implementation and monitoring of safety measures in the private schools.

SC Guidelines

As per the Supreme Court guidelines on child safety in schools, a school management should install sufficient CCTV cameras on campus, facing road and and periphery. When a team of Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) inspected the school where the gang rape took place, it did not find CCTV cameras in hostels. The UCPCR team also found that the girls' hostel, housing 22 students, did not have any warden for a month.

The Supreme Court guidelines also state that all areas of the school premises should be regularly monitored and any unauthorised person should be questioned for their presence. School management is also required to appoint some staff as vigilance monitors on rotation to keep an eye on all activities of students. However, these are guidelines. A set of non-negotiable child safety conditions for schools is still awaited.

Accountability

Welham Boys' School principal Guneet Bindra said, ""When parents leave their children in a residential school, school authorities become their pseudo parents. We have to care for each and every child as our own. This includes taking care of their health, hygiene, safety and well-being.""

Bindra said negligence of any kind by a school in the safety of a child is unacceptable. ""Internal security of a school is vital and cannot be compromised.""

Safety in schools

In October last year, the principals' progressive school association (PPSA) issued a safety advisory to all its 176 member schools of Dehradun. These included installing CCTV cameras and their regular monitoring, police verification of all employees, advising parents not to drop off their children to school too early or pick them up too late and an entry system of each student, preferably in the form of biometric. The advisory also stated that no area of the school should be left unattended.

""The members of the association meet annually to discuss issues of safety and security of the children. We also ensure that all the member schools follow the guidelines that we have laid down,"" president of PPSA Prem Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

""However, the school where this unfortunate incident took place is not a member of PPSA and I have never visited the campus as well. So I do not know how they were operating,"" Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

Jennifer Kumar, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) school association's state president, said: ""ICSE has issued guidelines for safety of students, which we abide by. There are periodic inspections by members of the council to monitor the same."" She said security of a student was of 'paramount importance', irrespective of which examination board the school is affiliated with."

Days after the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) issued a suspension notice against two private schools here the Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) Tuesday said they have received fresh complaints against some more private schools for charging exorbitant fee in violation of its directives.

Chairman of FFC, Justice (Retd) Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain said the committee has received some new complaints against private schools for violating its recommended fee structure.

Hussain said FFC has received complaints from the parents of students enrolled in Minto Circle School, Srinagar who are 'violating' the FFC norms by charging exorbitant fee from them.

Meanwhile another member of FFC wishing anonymity told Rising Kashmir that it has received a complaint from the parents against Linton Hall School, Rajbagh for the same issue.

According to FFC, they have recommended Rs 1200 for Linton Hall School, Rajbagh but in violation of norms the school is charging Rs 1350 per month.

When asked about the recent suspension orders to RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh, Hussain said, ""We had informed both the school authorities to charge only recommended fee, but they did not adhere to that. The complaints of those schools were received by FFC and DSEK.""

The parents of various schools told Rising Kashmir that they want to register complaints against the private schools who violate the norms of FFC but they are unaware of the process to do so. The parents said they want to know whether they can file complaints online.

However, the chairman of FFC blamed the parents for not filing complaints against those schools who are violating FFC guidelines. ""We cannot act against any school till we have a genuine complaint or proof against it. In today's meeting we have told our Chief Education Officers (CEO) to conduct inspection of all schools who are violating the FFC norms,"" FFC chairman said.

Replying to a query he said, ""All the private schools are violating the norms but only those are caught and highlighted against whom the complaints have been filed by the parents. Parents fear reprisal but we assure them their complaints are kept confidential.""

FFC Chairman added that they have regulated the tuition fee structure of various prominent schools which includes DPS Srinagar, Presentation Convent, Mallinson and Tyndale Biscoe School, Burn Hall School and many other schools.

He said the missionary schools like Biscoe and Mallinson charge Rs 35,000 as admission fee and for the whole year they charge Rs 85,000 which includes tuition fee, transport fee and other charges as well.

""RP School or Green Valley cannot be compared with DPS Srinagar because the Supreme Court in its guidelines had mentioned that the school with more facilities can charge accordingly,"" Hussain said.

He further said that for RP School FFC has recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee but they are charging Rs 1900 which is a violation of FFC guidelines.

""Similarly, Green Valley Educational Institute has a good amount of surplus money and that is why we told them that why they are charging more than what FFC has recommended,"" he added."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The department of school education, Kashmir has de-recognised two prominent private schools in downtown Srinagar on September 15.

However, the decision has turned out to be controversial as parents of the schoolchildren claim that it could damage the academic career of their kids. The schools facing the axe are RP School and Green Valley Educational Institute located in Malla Bagh, an area in downtown Srinagar.

Although the reason mentioned by the education department officials behind the de-recognition is the exorbitant fee charged by the school management, a section of the parents allege that the decision by the administration could be a crackdown on schools that are teaching Islamic moral education.

The posts on social media in support of the school administrations have now gone viral. This indicates that the present state administration may be opposed to the idea of teaching Islamic education in valley schools.

Social media users posted pictures of the students offering Namaz (Islamic prayers) and women teachers and students clad in Hijab and Burqa on school premises. They also claimed that the state administration under the garb of exorbitant fees did not want the preaching of Islamic practices among students.

""Fee hikes are a norm in all big schools. But singling out a school where Islamic education in being taught, where zuhr prayer is a must. It is disgraceful. In RP we trust. I am proud I have spent few of my years in RP. My future daughter is going to RP,"" Aafan Hakak tweeted.

A post which lays down fees sturucture of various eminent schools in the state, which includes Christian missionary schools besides others, said that the two schools which faced de-recognition comparatively charged lesser fees.

""These schools which face the suspension charge only half the amount of montly fees compared to the missionary schools and other elite institutions which are run by affluent people. This is a selective decision and there is a greater design to regulate the religious teachings among students,"" a parent, under the condition of anonymity, said.

A medico, Masood Rashid whose children are studying in RP School wrote on Fcaebook, ""I strongly condemn biased and selective action by DSEK against RP School Malabagh...My children are reading in same school...Fee structure is less than other schools or equal...I want to know who are these self-styled parent association...Who has given them consent...Who made them representatives...These self styled association people are actually extortionists and their only aim is to get extrabenifits for their own children...They usually blackmail school authorities...DSEK and pseudo parent representatives are fully responsible for whatever trauma to out-going students and their parents....""

The Department of school education, Kashmir, has however said in an official statement that the decision is only an initial step in the process of streamlining the private education sector in Kashmir and has appealed to the citizens to bring to the notice of authorities any arbitrary hike in fees by private schools."

Director School Education has also called for adjusting the enrolled students of these schools in nearby Government schools for ensuing examination. Itoo has also cautioned all the heads of the private institutions not to hike the fee on their own and comply with the instructions and orders from the department, in letter and spirit. Though slammed for being harsh in some quarters, the decision has come as a shot in the arm of the parents who are otherwise largely taken for granted by the management of the private schools and made to pay through their nose. So, the extreme action by the government is certain to lend them some sense of empowerment. And in future they won't find themselves solely at the mercy of the school managements who don't shy away from forcing the parents to pay up the entire fees even in times of disasters like the 2014 deluge. One could hope that the government action reigns in the private schools which have otherwise become a law unto themselves.

Last year, the state government's school fee fixation committee has given a nod to the enhancement of fee structure of private educational institutions by eight percent. The order issued in October last is valid for three years. The decision came after the J&K High Court directed the state government to frame a policy regarding annual fee enhancement. But as the derecognized two schools would have us believe, the government's orders are observed largely in breach. The schools would easily get away with their arbitrary fee hikes, cocking a snook at the government. And parents are in no position to resist this.

But again the people are bound to watch Itoo's order with some scepticism. Will the new action succeed where the previous initiatives have failed? Only time will tell. But the outcome of the past interventions should hardly detract from the significance of the fresh measure. Director School Education has the power to get private schools to fall in line. He is in a position to withdraw the recognition should schools refuse to do his bidding as he has now practically demonstrated.

Ideally, the private schools, especially the elite schools, should have taken the lead and in a spirit of mutual understanding worked with the parents to fix a mutually agreed amount of fees. But this isn't happening. And now the government has taken a note of this arbitrary state of affairs and acted with suspension of the recognition of the two schools. But it needs to follow it up with actions that make a visible difference on the ground. More so, in a situation where private school managements have not been enough socially responsible to act on their own."

On Saturday, School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan, announced that separate mark sheets each for 600 marks will be issued for Classes 11 and 12. He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12.

Warning strict action against private schools in Uttarakhand prescribing non-NCERT books, the director general of primary education department has said it may even lead to cancellation of their no-objection certificates (NOCs).

On Thursday, the department served notices to 186 private schools of the state affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) in this regard. The state government had taken a decision earlier this year to make books by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) compulsory for all private CBSE schools of the state. This decision was also backed by the high court in April.

Alok Shekhar Tiwari, director general of primary education, said: ""This matter will not be taken lightly. We have issued notices to these schools and have sought their reply. The schools have acted against the high court verdict, which is contempt of court and we will bring this to the court's notice.

We will also seek the court's guidelines on further action. If the court so instructs, we will withdraw the NOCs of these schools and will register an FIR against them as well.""

CBSE grants affiliation to a school only if it has an NOC by the state government. Tiwari said the department cannot proceed in the matter independently as it is sub-judice.

In its judgment, the court had said that if a school is prescribing books from private publishers, they should be at par with the NCERT books in terms of quality and cost. Schools cannot prescribe books from private publishers which cost more than NCERT books.

After receiving several complaints from the parents, education minister Arvind Pandey constituted nodal officers in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to survey all the private schools in their respective districts and identify the defaulters.

The officers found 186 out of 226 private schools in violation of the high court order.

""The schools have been trying to defend themselves by saying that the books by private publishers are for their library but it is baseless. If these books are for the library, then why have the parents been made to buy them in addition to the NCERT books? This has led to extra financial burden on the parents,"" Tiwari said.

Deputy director, primary education, Jitendra Saxena, said: ""We have served notices to these schools on the basis of nine points. The schools are supposed to display the rates of the books on their websites but most of them have not done so. Many don't even have a website."""

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), said many of these initiatives were ""unscientific and not practical"".

Other members of the All Boards Association, which includes State board as well as CBSE schools, too were of the same opinion.

Homework

B.R. Supreeth, office-bearer of the Management of Independent CBSE Schools, said schools had evolved homework to ensure it was only a recap of the things learnt in the classroom. ""Teachers do not ask students to write impositions like how they used to do earlier. We give meaningful homework that supplements classroom learning. The State government should not ban homework,"" he said.

Mr. Shashi Kumar said it was not practical for all schools to have a locker facility for students. ""The department can recommend that schools have lockers so that students can keep their belongings. But this cannot be imposed on budget private schools,"" he said.

He said the government had not considered their inputs before evolving various policies. School managements are willing to implement no bag day once a month, he added. He urged the department to declare second Saturday as holiday for students so that they get time to spend with their family.

CM's intervention sought

Private school managements sought the Chief Minister's intervention, claiming that Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh was not available to listen to their grievances.

""There are several issues pertaining to reimbursement of RTE quota admissions and supply of textbooks that need to be addressed. We have tried contacting the Minister at least 25 times, and he has refused to give us time to discuss our concerns,"" Mr. Shashi Kumar said."

Private school managements and the State government were at loggerheads over the fee structure, as it had not been revised for 18 years.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We are all now complying with the fee structure and all our member schools will display it from December.""

He said the move aims to bring in accountability and transparency. This has been the long-standing demand of parents. Schools that do not comply with the fee structure can be penalised up to ₹10 lakh.

For several years, school managements have been violating the fee structure policy, terming it ""archaic"".

According to the new fee structure, besides recurring costs, school managements can charge an additional fee that differs based on the location -- ranging from 70% of the recurring fee in gram panchayat and town panchayat limits to about 100% in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike areas. The special development fee has been raised to ₹2,500 from ₹600. Schools also are not allowed to hike the fees by more than 15% from the previous academic year.

Together, these risk factors make them vulnerable to develop a host of non-communicable diseases, primarily cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. They are the major cause of adult mortality and illness worldwide.

The students of government schools, who come from lower socio-economic strata, are relatively less vulnerable to get these diseases, the study conducted by researchers from AIIMS, Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Institute of Health Management and Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says.

The research involved screening of 1369, 786 boys and 543 girls -- studying in grades II and XI in 10 randmly selected private schools and nine government schools.

Number of underweight students in government schools was, however, noted to be three times that of the private school students.

Hypertension and bad cholesterol, risk factors usually associated with increasing age and unhealthy lifestyle, was also found to be affecting the students.

In the study, the prevalence of hypertensive students in private schools was 13% and in government schools it was 4.5%. Monika Arora, the lead author of the study told TOI, this is the first research to report on the distribution of multiple risk factors for NCDs in school students in India, comparing low socio-economic status (government schools) to high socio-economic status (private schools).

Unable to handle the number of applications for admission, this school has put up a ""no admissions"" board at the entrance.

There are two sections for Telugu students and three for English in each class. The school has 46 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching staff, a library, science lab and playground apart from other facilities. ""Last three years, we secured 100 per cent pass in Class-X examinations,"" says the school headmaster Banda Venkat Reddy. While the school is 'almost perfect' the headmaster has urged the government to construct a kitchen where midday meals can be cooked.

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders! Every since the boring school became a 'train school' dropout rates have frozen, say authorities. Also, they are seeing a sudden jump in attendance rate. Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

Several Private schools in Delhi have decided not to celebrate the Teachers' Day on September 5. A few of those are likely to observe a muted celebrations. The private schools have taken this decision citing ""spate of arrests"" of teachers and principals in the national capital. The school authorities also alleged that they were treated in poor, unfair manner. An association of over 160 senior secondary private schools, The National Progressive Schools' Conference (NPSC), has reportedly issued an advisory to schools.

The Affordable Private Schools' Association has also decided not to celebrate Teachers' Day on September 5. ""We, the educationist fraternity, have to restore the value in our society and respect of the teachers, so that we can bring trust in the system,"" it said in a statement. Earlier on August 21, the Springdales Education Society had sent a note stating it will not be hosting the Teachers' Day dinner this year.

The Springdales Education Society circular said this is ""owing to a series of disturbing events in schools, in and outside Delhi, where principals and teachers have been held accountable for situations that in many instances have not been the responsibility of schools and their management"". ""Teachers are being targeted on unproven allegations of a lack of safety of school children. The relationship between the school and parents, too, is merely transactional and not what we desire it to be or what it used to be,"" it said.

Two teachers and the principal of a school were arrested after a Class IX student allegedly committed suicide. Parents had accused teacher and the school of harassing the student.

Earlier in April, the National Coalition for School Education (NCSE) had demanded reforms in education, including amendment to the Right to Education Act. Speaking to reporters, NCSE chairman Kulbhushan Sharma said, ""While the state of education calls for urgent reform, the government seems to be working only for appeasement and quick fix."" ""Amendments needs to be made to RTE legislation for learning outcome-based school recognition system instead of mere infrastructure-based norms, which have led thousands of schools to close down,"" Sharma said."

A survey that assessed students across 20 states revealed that 9 in 10 children in urban private schools cannot read in English.

The report, 'Where India reads 2017-18', covered 19,765 children of classes IV, V and VI in 106 private schools in cities, across 20 states, including Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir among others.

The survey conducted by Stones2Milestones, an organisation that aims to address the reading and learning levels of school going students. This was reviewed by Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER).

The report suggests that problem lies within our households. ""English is a second or even third language, in several Indian households and children speak in their mother tongue which is either Hindi or a regional language. However, at school they are expected to learn a language which is foreign to them, in a formal setting.""

Nikhil Saraf, co-founder, Stones2Milestones, said, ""The test was conducted online to check comprehension, vocabulary and reading habits of students under their teachers' supervision. Some students answered a few test items in an unreasonably short time. Since it is unlikely for a small child to read and respond in snap of a finger, we did not count for scoring.""

""This also points to several behavioural peculiarities, which could include reading fatigue, non-seriousness and bad monitoring practices.""

The schools were provided with a list of suggestions and actions needed to improve reading levels based on the assessment report.

""The focus should be to make reading to the core as a learning focus rather than just restrict it to a namesake library period,"" said Kavish Gadia, co-founder and CEO, Stones2Milestones.

Christel R Devadaswon, head, Department of English, University of Delhi, said, ""A policy is required to improve the literacy rate and stakeholders should look at the perspective of children and their socioeconomic situations.""

Venita Kaul, ex-senior education specialist and chairperson of the Advisory Committee of Center for Early Childhood Education and Development (CECED), said, ""I hope this report will initiate a discussion on challenges many Indian children face due to multi-lingual environment at home. It will sensitise parents, teachers and other stakeholders regarding the need to revisit classroom pedagogy for teaching reading to children. This is an urgent need in primary schools since children learn best in ways more developmentally and contextually appropriate for them. Once that is done, future assessments of children's reading skills will undoubtedly present a more favourable picture of their reading levels."""

This is a 60 per cent increase above the average education expenditure and is financed by a reduction of expenditure on food, institutional medical care, entertainment among others.

These are some of the facts that were presented by two development researchers in a presentation titled ""How do Households Finance Private School Education?"" in an international conference on public policy and management organised by IIM, Bengaluru in New Delhi recently.

""We set out to analyse the financing patterns of private education by families because it's a common experience that even urban poor and low-income families in rural areas now prefer private schools over government schools,"" said Nishant Chadha of India Development Foundation, a researcher.

""And the findings so far, I would say, have been startling as families cut their other expenses significantly to ensure things like tuition, uniforms and recurrent fee that private schooling demands.""

The researchers used data from 68th round of National Sample Survey Office for the analysis The motivation for the analysis came from a 2015 Assocham survey which had said that nearly one in ten respondents indicated that the cost associated with schooling has actually affected even their choice of school.

Over 70 per cent of parents spend 30-40 per cent of take-home pay on their children education, placing a significant burden on their family budget, the survey had also found. ""While the annual fees are on average Rs 65,000 to Rs. 1,25,000 on a single child for regular schools, even the preschools for those aged 3 to 5 cost, parents about Rs 35,000 to Rs 75,000 a term,"" Assocham survey had said.

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

After four rounds of admissions, less than a quarter of the 1,400 reserved seats on offer in the city's private schools for differently abled students were filled this year. This has prompted the government to carry forward the vacant seats to the next academic year.

Hindustan Times had reported last week that the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) had invited fresh online applications for 1,268 entry-level reserved seats for a fourth round of admissions to the current academic year which has just three months left.

On Wednesday, the draw of lots were held for these seats but only 123 were filled. The DoE cited ""lack of applications"" for the large number of seats going vacant.

""Of the 125 applications we received during the fresh round of admission, 123 candidates were absorbed. The selected candidates have to approach the allotted school on or before December 31,"" DoE director Sanjay Goel said.

According to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (PWD) Act, 2016, three per cent of the total number of seats meant for the economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups (EWS/DG) category are reserved for children with disabilities.

Goel said that the department will carry forward the remaining reserved seats to next academic session (2019-20). ""The seats will be counted in the category during next year's admission,"" he said. The notification of admission in the entry level classes under the 25% reserved seats for the EWS/DG category is likely to be announced in the first week of January, next year.

Officials in the DoE said that they are planning to organise awareness campaigns among parents to motivate them to apply.

""There is lack of awareness among parents about the reserved seats because this was the first time the quota was introduced within the 25% EWS/DG seats. We are planning to organise campaigns to aware parents from the coming admission session,"" an official said.

Experts, however, said that the ""lack of inclusiveness"" in schools make parents reluctant from applying. ""Though the situation in private schools is better than the government schools, parents of children with disabilities are still reluctant from applying there.

While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees.

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food.

In the last five years, more than 100 BMC schools have been shut down owing to dwindling student numbers.

""We got applications from 14 such aided schools, seeking municipal schools' premises on rent. Their own buildings are in ruins. However, there is a Bombay High Court order barring to rent out any municipal school building. Hence, we have refused their plea,"" said a senior official in the Education Department.

He added, ""Earlier, BMC had given some of the schools' rooms to non-government organisations and political organisations for educational purposes. But they started using them as offices and for non- educational activities. Due to these irregularities, somebody filed a petition in court. The court ordered the civic body to remove all such offices and keep the schools only for educational purposes.""

""The request from aided schools is genuine. Students in these schools are risking their lives. I will bring this proposal in group leaders meeting and come up with a solution,"" said Education Committee Chairman Mangesh Satamkar.

The civic body data showed that there are over 1,300 BMC schools across the city."

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing.

An endless debate rages in the education sector over whether school education ought to be run solely by the state or allowed to move into private hands.

Though a host of individuals, experts and organisations strongly favour a state-run education system, the fact is that state schools all over the world, including India, have witnessed a steady outflow of children to the private school system. ""Parents are voting with their feet. The private education sector exists for a reason and we have to stop pretending that it doesn't,"" says Aashti Zaidi Hai, director of the ..."

Apparently, the poor didn't know the value of education and used their children as labour.

This debate should have died after the 1991 liberalisation when poor parents woke up and became eager to send their children to English medium schools. Was this treated as good news? Not really, for the elites found something else to complain about.

The poor wanted schools, but couldn't find any. Many primary schools that had supposedly been ""built"" by government in remote villages simply didn't exist: that money had long evaporated through corruption. Where the poor did have a local primary school, it was dilapidated and its appointed teachers didn't even come to the school. And in the few cases where the teachers did come, the parents found the teachers to be hopelessly incompetent. Not a surprise since most of them have bribed their way into the job.

And so, as Gurcharan Das has said, India grows at night. Where the government fails, private enterprise steps in to retrieve the situation and bring in a modicum of development. That's what happened in the school sector. To meet this huge demand, private for-profit low-cost schools sprung up like mushrooms. These were not perfect by any stretch of imagination but they were vastly superior to the non-existent or even the average government ""school"", as Tooley's diligent research has shown.

When this happened, the elites moved their goalpost and started complaining against these private schools. Anurag Behar's recent article in Live Mint is a case in point. No matter the poor do, India's elites will always find something wrong with them.

The elites are now demanding a huge increase in government management and funding in the school sector. Apparently, it was not enough for the government to have failed totally and comprehensively for 70 years. Our only saviour is our government once again, headed by criminals who appoint teachers through bribes and who pocket the taxes allocated for school infrastructure. According to our elites, the private sector is nothing but a pain in the neck and must be sidelined.

In my view there are two explanations for this inexplicable view by people like Mr Behar. Either these elites are grossly ill-informed or they have a hidden agenda. Is it possible that not being capable of delivering better low-cost schools that poor parents will pay for, in the face of cut-throat competition, elite NGOs are bagging their competition in order to grab government subsidies?

But let me take a more charitable perspective, which turns out to be possibly worse in some ways. I suspect the real explanation is that these elites have a strong ideological belief in socialism which has made them blind to the blatant crimes and corruption of government, even where the evidence is right in front of their nose.

In India we pay twice for everything: first we pay the government, and then, after it has failed, we pay a second time, to the private sector, to finally get the job done, with whatever money we still have left in our pocket.

The elites must surely realise that nothing concentrates the mind more than poverty. Even the slightest expenditure the poor make must pass the most stringent tests. That poor parents are choosing to pay twice for their children's education tells that something is seriously wrong with the government system. To suggest that such poor people are stupid and gullible is to discount what they are trying to tell us: Stop looting us and let us free.

We know from Tooley's research (and I have some personal direct evidence that I'll mention some other day in another context) that these parents are actively monitoring the performance of their children. And to ensure that these parents' don't move their child to another school, the school owners are constantly monitoring the performance of the teachers. The incentives align perfectly.

Of course, these schools have poor infrastructure - but that's all the poor can pay for. This, however, is not the pivotal issue. Gandhi rightly told us that it is not school infrastructure but the teacher that matters most. We need teachers who actually come to teach. And second, that these teachers are at least moderately competent.

It is unfortunate that an institution named after one of India's greatest entrepreneurs, Aziz Premji, has such a dim view about perhaps the greatest example of entrepreneurship in the world - the low cost for-profit private schools of India.

Good policy can't be made by assuming a role for government. It must begin by understanding any market failure and doing the best to support the market to overcome any such failure. Today there is a real market in school education in India with very little market failure. All we need is to support these schools through school vouchers for the poorest of the poor. Indeed, that's our party's policy.

One last point. Mr Behar points out that teachers in such schools are paid below the minimum wage. Our party rejects the very concept of minimum wage which is both theoretically and practically proven to harm the poorest of the poor. Our party will abolish minimum wage laws. Instead of seeing this as a problem, I suggest that Mr Behar celebrate the vast employment that these schools have generated and how well they are serving a genuine need to the best of their ability - despite total government antipathy.

It is not that these teachers are underpaid. Instead, teachers in government schools are grossly overpaid. In a private competitive system, teachers would all receive their marginal product. Better teachers would be paid vastly more than any teacher is paid today."

A division bench comprising Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the interim reprieve to private educational institutions, on a plea moved by All India Private Educational Institutions Association assailing the amendment dated January 25.

According to the petitioner, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act and the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act provided exemption from payment of property tax to educational institutions in the state.

The state government brought in certain amendments to these Acts to remove the exemption provided to the institutions and empowering the authorities to levy property tax for the properties owned by the institutions. After the amendment, only government run educational institutions would get the exemption, the petitioner said.

The move was immediately challenged by the association in the high court. The high court dismissed the plea holding that the government has power to cancel exemption granted to educational institutions. Subsequently, the association approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court order.

This is in violation with the policy on Karnataka Educational Institutions (Regulation of Certain Fees and Donations) (Amendment) Rules 2018, which has been in force mandating the schools to stick to the calendar of events released by the Department of Public Instruction for admission.

The issue has gone viral on social media platforms, where parents have formed groups alleging that schools are charging up to '1,000 as fee per application form without confirming a seat.

This reporter from The New Indian Express visited some schools on Friday posing as a parent seeking admission and was shocked to learn that some schools have even closed the admission process for the next academic year.

Authorities of one such school located in South Bengaluru, offering both CBSE and ICSE syllabus, said, ""You are too late. We have already finished issuing applications for the next academic year and seats will also be announced soon.""

Another prime school, also located in Bengaluru South, issued the application form, but said they cannot assure a seat as they have already received application forms in excess of the seats available. ""We cannot assure you the seat. We are already flooded with applications. You will have to try your luck. If someone surrenders their seat, you may get a chance,"" said a front office staff member.

So blatant is this malpractice in the background of the sheer lack of regulation or enforcement of rules that some schools have even dared to publish their commencement of admission process for academic year 2019-20 on their official websites without fear of reprisals.

Shilpa Prashanth, a South Bengaluru parent said, ""I was looking for admission of my son at one of the prime schools in our locality, but I was surprised to hear that I was too late. Although I approached them in mid-October, the school had already closed the admission process.""

Another parent said, ""I took applications for my son from three main schools in West Bengaluru, but of the three, one school said they cannot promise a seat, while another demanded full payment of fees up front, now itself. So, I have decided to wait for communication from the third school.""

Moreover, some of the schools which are confirming the seats while collecting advance fees to block the seats, are refraining from giving a receipt to the parents in return for the payment. ""We have to agree at the risk of losing the amount as the schools are not giving receipts. But, as it is hard to get seats in these schools, we are being forced to agree and accept whatever the conditions laid down by the schools,"" said one desperate parent.

Paying heavy price for education

Scared to file plaint

Although the District Education Regulatory Authority (DERA) is active, parents do not dare to file complaints as they are worried that such an act would affect their child's prospects in getting a seat

WHAT THE RULE SAYS

According to the Karnataka Education Act, the schools established in the state are not allowed to start admissions for the next academic year until the state department of public instructions releases the calendar of events

Normally, the calendar is released in the end of April or first week of May

It can be recalled that when Tanveer Sait was the primary and secondary education minister, he had directed his department officials to quash all such ""early admissions"" and declare them illegal"

Subject-wise performance evaluation of students from government and private schools from the state, revealed the performance of government school students to be poorer than private schools in all districts, apart from Hyderabad where the performance was on par.

Looking at the data, it should not be a surprise that parents prefer shelling out more money in sending their children to private schools for education than government for better education. As per available data, more than half of the about 48 lakh students studying in various schools in Telangana, are studying in private schools.

For example, while the performance of students from government schools in Nalgonda was 31 per cent and 33 per cent in Mathematics and Science, it was 39 per cent and 40 percent respectively by private school students. Similarly, while the performance of government school students in Karimnagar in Social Science and English subjects was 38 per cent and 34 per cent respectively, it was 46 per cent and 56 per cent in private schools.

Only in Hyderabad, the difference between performance of government and private school students was not significant.

Urban-rural divide also deep

Significant difference in performance of students in various subjects has also been observed with respect to whether a student belongs to rural or urban area, indicating the disparity in quality of education received by students depending on where they belong from.

In the NAS it has been observed that in all districts of the state the performance of students in urban areas is higher than those from rural areas. For example, in Rangareddy district while the performance of students in Mathematics and Science in rural areas was found to be 33 per cent and 35 per cent respectively, in the urban areas it was 41 per cent in each subject. Similar is the case in all other districts.

Caste affects spoken English

The NAS also highlights the need for ensuring that education reaches every student equitably, regardless of the caste of the student. Significant difference has been found in the performance of students from the general category and those from the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes.

A difference of almost 5-10 per cent was observed in the performances of students from general categories as compared to those from reserved categories. The difference was prominent in all the subjects that students study at the high school level.

However, the difference is most pronounced, as much as 15 per cent, in case of English language. For example, while the students belonging to the general category had an average performance percentage in Mathematics of 41 per cent while English had 50 per cent. On the other hand, among the students from Scheduled Castes it was 31 per cent and 35 per cent respectively."

The Association while condemning the move said that the certain lobby in administration and few other quarters who in one way or other are trying to destroy the fledgling private education sector in Kashmir.

G N Var, chairman PSAJK said that Legal Metrology Department, Directorate of School Education, Fee Fixation Committee, district administration and everybody who wields some sort of power are swooping down on small private schools to harass them. In the name of selling books, schools are being targeted unnecessarily.

""Today running a private school has become a herculean task. With mudslinging, barrage of allegations and character assassinations, private schools are being labelled as some kind of criminals,"" he said.

War said incidentally, there is no rule which specifically says that schools cannot keep books in their schools for sale. In fact in February this year, High Court in New Delhi had allowed the sale of books, uniforms in schools at the tuck shops set up at affiliated schools across the country, holding that the sale of such items does not amount to ""commercialization"" of education.

""If the Government was sincere about selling of books in private schools, why didn't they take up the issue when the big schools like Missionary Schools sold every book, notebook and stationery items from their schools? Where were they when these schools forced parents to buy everything from their schools? This has been their practice for more than 20 years, yet they were never raided. It was only when the admission time in local private schools came, the Government suddenly wakes up. Two respected private schools like Green Valley and R P School were given harsh punishment even as no hand was laid on Missionary Schools despite later being way too costly,"" he said.

""In an ideal situation, the Government should have emulated the private school model and revolutionized the education sector. They could have provided the best education to the lowest of strata using our model but what they are doing is to destroy the only successful model of education in Kashmir.

CBSE had asked all affiliated schools to upload transfer certificates (TC) issued to students after completion of Std IX or XI, but almost all private schools have continued to ignore the diktat. The 2014 decision was taken so that students seeking admission to Std X or XII do not face delays just because their TC from previous school could not be verified. It was in the same year that CBSE's rule of counter-signature of TCs from school to the other was scrapped.

CBSE wrote to schools a few weeks ago saying that many schools are not following the rule even though it is mandatory. It added that students are facing unnecessary delays in admissions because of this. In the post-2014 scenario, CBSE simplified the Std X and XII admission process by asking the new schools to simply verify the student's TC from his previous school's web site and complete the admission formalities. But with private schools ignoring the rule, the paperwork for student increases and it delays admission in the new school.

Even though this practice is mandatory, none of the Nagpur-based private schools, whose websites were checked by TOI, had uploaded details of the TC. They didn't even give any tab on website mentioning that no TCs were taken. Government controlled Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) have a separate tab on their website which gives details of TCs issued in the current academic year.

It is now a well-known fact that many schools force parents to buy books and uniforms only from a particular shop. This way they earn some extra money from the sale of the books and uniforms which in turn are sold to parents at an exorbitant cost. A prominent missionary school in Baramulla was recently fined for selling textbooks through a single bookshop only. But the menace is not confined to a single school only. Many elite schools in the Valley themselves sell these books but no action has so far been taken against them. It is thus necessary that the action against schools shouldn't be initiated on a selective basis.

Also, forays into commercial activities isn't only thing that is wrong with the private schools: their arbitrary fee structure and for that matter the quality of their teaching itself is a great cause of concern. What is needed, therefore, is not only the regulation of their commercial activities and the fee structure but a comprehensive look at the whole system of private schooling in the state. The objective should not be more regulation of these schools but to ensure that they deliver quality education for which they charge heavily. Kashmir has witnessed an unprecedented growth of private schools and most of these lack infrastructure and adequately qualified staff. And even with schools which have the infrastructure, the quality of education is pits.

Private schools have tried to act as more disciplined and rigorous academic counterparts of the Government schools: regular class work, less holidays and more extra-curricular activities have been their hallmark. But so far as quality of education is concerned, there is little that sets them apart. They charge heavy fees from the parents and compensate it not by imparting good quality education but by showing off some style: bright uniforms and more extra-curricular activities. Education in these schools is about stage-management: loaded satchels, excessive homework and an endless supply of stationary which in turn is cleverly bound up with the business part of running a school.

The aspect of the school which gets least attention is the education, which in turn boils down to the recruitment of good teachers. The schools hire the disaffected educated youth who are willing to work for a pittance as a prelude to a much sought-after permanent government job. And most of them miserably lack the depth of knowledge to be good teachers. This malaise afflicts our educational system right through - from primary schools to the universities. Surprisingly, some of the franchise schools which have forayed into Valley in recent years are similarly afflicted: a large, imposing infrastructure but little depth in the all-important tuition part of their functioning. Even though, it is equally the job of parents to see that these schools provide the quality education they seek for their wards, government can help by forcing these institutions to pay well to the teachers which in turn will attract better talent."

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Nov. 3 : A legislator has noted reports that are implied to be practices of subtle discrimination in private institutions. Some of these include priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to 'weak' students; or schools asking parents to deposit money, which are not returned unless their wards improve in performance.

The advisor was addressing the 25th anniversary of the All Nagaland Private Schools Association, Dimapur unit (ANSPA) at the Dimapur District Sports Council which was packed with students, teachers, and guests on November 3 to celebrate the silver jubilee.

The advisor for School Education, K Tokugha Sukhalu, attended the occasion as its main guest. He said that the private schools were performing better than the government institutions in terms of discipline, culture and accountability. While Dimapur is comparatively better than the rest of the districts, he said, there is very less space for outdoor activities though. He said learning methods are changing and the ANSPA should be able to manage trained personnel so that children are equipped with proper skills. He appealed to the teachers to ensure that courses are completed in time and ensure children are taught properly.

However, the advisor pointed out some of negative reports that reportedly were doing the rounds with regard to private educational institutions. These reports included alleged priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to weak students; reputed schools asking parents to deposit money and unless the children improve, funds are reportedly not returned.

At these, he asked the teachers to be proud of their students no matter what 'background difference' there may be. One cannot compare students based on their educational backgrounds and ""you never know the brightest students may lose tomorrow,"" he said. Institutions should not be only for profit-making but to ensure that students are nurtured to be the leaders of future, he reminded.

Enrolment in private institutions is increasing whereas enrolment in government institutions is decreasing. So, the responsibility is huge for the ANSPA, Sukhalu remarked. He added that students are the future and urged the children to pledge to be the ""leaders of tomorrow.""

The director of the Central Board of School Education at Guwahati, KK choudhury, also addressed the event. He said that ""Nagaland is a big contributor to the literacy rate of the country with 80.11%.""

In this changing scenario, non-conventional subjects are getting importance and employment opportunities are being widened. Almost 90% of job opportunities are available in the unorganised sector, he said. The official encouraged the gathering to embrace technology and incorporate the knowledge in their field. Further, he said that the Northeast region contributes greatly to the cultural and natural resources of the country."

The list available with the state department of public instructions, provided by the Deputy Directors of Public Instructions (DDPI), indicates that over 50 private schools affiliated to various boards have violated the act and are not introducing Kannada as their first or second language.

Following the recommendations by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), the state government had decided to make Kannada a compulsory subject (first or second language) at all the schools functioning in the state, irrespective of the board they follow, and the same had been implemented from the academic year 2018-19. But, even six months after the commencement of the academic year, some schools have been found violating the rule.

When the state government took this decision, several private schools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE boards had raised an objection. But, later as it became a state policy, the schools were forced to implement it.

Recently, the Kannada Development Authority received complaints against some of the schools alleging that they were not following the said rule. Based on the complaints, KDA chairperson Prof SG Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the state department of primary and secondary education to submit a report.

""Following the letter received from the KDA chairperson, we have instructed our DDPIs to visit the schools across the state and submit a report about the alleged violation. For some of the districts, we have yet to get the report,"" said Basavaraja, director of primary education department.

He said the department would initiate an action against such schools soon by first issuing notices as per the process. ""Once we get the report from all the districts we will issue notices to school managements which are violating the Compulsory Kannada rule,"" Basavaraja said.

The KDA authorities, on their part, have directed the primary and secondary education department to initiate action to disaffiliate such schools. Prof Siddaramaiah said, ""I have written a letter to the education department about the violation of the act by some of the private schools and have asked them to submit action taken report. But till date we have not received a reply from them. The department must take measures immediately to disaffiliate such schools.""

However, the rule framed by the department has no provisions to disaffiliate violating schools. As per the rules, the department can only levy a penalty of '500 on such schools in the first year."

The state government had declared Navratri holidays from October 10 to October 17 in all schools across the state. To accommodate these, the government had reduced the 21 days Diwali break to 13 days. The schools have now been directed to observe holidays from November 5 to November 17.

Members of Self Finance Schools Management Association, on Monday, decided to observe a 21-day break from November 5 to November 25.

The association on Tuesday submitted a memorandum in this regard to Surat District Collector Dhaval Patel.

Take the case of a 40-year-old single mother, who earns no more than Rs 4,000 a month. She said her excitement at her daughter getting enrolled in a private school in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar was short-lived as she was forced to then spend money on her books, uniform and stationery. ""My daughter was admitted to Anglo Indian Public School in Class 1, under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, this year. We were told we would get everything for free, as per the RTE (Act). But so far, nothing has been provided. I have spent nearly Rs 8,000 on her books, stationery, and uniform,"" the woman said, requesting anonymity. She said she had the bills for items worth Rs 7,900.

The woman said she was concerned about paying for her daughter's winter uniform, which would cost at least Rs 3,000.

Officials at Anglo Indian Public School said they had been unable to provide free uniforms and stationery items because they had not yet received any funds from the government. Chander Singh, a spokesperson for the school, said: ""Last year too, we received only Rs 1,125 per student. How can this amount cover books, uniform and stationery items and examination fees?""

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25 % of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and first standard -- are to be reserved for children whose parents earn less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.

At present, the Delhi government is supposed to reimburse Rs 1,100 per student for uniforms and another Rs 2,200 for books, stationery, tuition and exam fees.

HT is in possession of at least 100 complaints, written by families who claim they have been deprived of the free study material and uniforms by private schools.

""We have received hundreds of complaints from parents whose children are not provided anything by private schools. We had forwarded all the complaints to the education minister's office but to no avail,"" Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working for EWS children in Delhi, said.

Debate over funds

In 2013, a group of private schools had moved the Delhi high court claiming that the amount paid by the state government per child was too low to meet all expenses. The court, in 2014, directed private schools to provide books, stationery items and uniforms to students under the EWS/DG categories, and said it was the responsibility of both the government and the schools to ensure free education to these students. The matter is still subjudice. Even as the Delhi high court issued as many as 46 reminders to private schools between April 2014 and September 2018 to provide the required materials, parents claim they have still not received anything.

Most of the private schools this correspondent contacted declined to comment, saying the matter was subjudice.

Kamal Gupta, counsellor, Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools in Delhi, a body representing 450 private schools said half the schools have not received any funds from the government.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's education department -- Directorate of Education (DoE) -- said it already provided funds to the private schools and was requesting the government for ""additional funds"" to meet the revised estimates. The government, this year, increased the reimbursement amount by Rs 600.

""Whatever demand is pending for this year will be fully met by end-November. However, the delayed release of funds cannot be the reason for private schools not giving books and uniforms to the students,"" he said. Goel said the DoE had also issued multiple notices to many schools and warned they would de-recognise them if they did not provide books and uniforms.

Parents bear costs

Another parent, requesting anonymity, said two of his children were not given uniforms by a private school in north Delhi. ""My children got admission in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category this year. The school had given them used books but not uniforms and stationery. I had to buy those myself,"" said the man, who works in a grocery shop and earns Rs 5,000 a month.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate representing families in Delhi high court, said, ""There is no provision under which the parents can claim reimbursements once they spend the money on these things. They can only be issued a fresh set of uniforms or books once the schools get the money.""

Despite attempts, education minister Manish Sisodia did not respond to requests for a comment."

They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc."

According to records of the Directorate of Education (DoE) , of the 48,122 seats reserved under the so-called economically weaker section or EWS category in private schools at the entry level, only 35,500 seats have been filled. And according to a recent report submitted by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to the DoE, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

The schools have given a variety of reasons for refusing admission: no vacancies; the school being too far from the home of the child seeking admission; or that even general category seats are yet to be filled. The sixth round of admissions is still underway.

In some cases, parents this correspondent interviewed alleged that private schools denied admission to their wards even after their names appeared in the selected lists. DoE's response to this is that many such families do not report for admission even after the names have come up in the draw of lots and the selected names are displayed on the DoE website. DoE, which comes under the state government's education department, releases the list of selected candidates.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said, ""All these seats are vacant in less popular schools. Parents are not interested in getting their kids enrolled there. We have issued multiple notices to the schools after receiving complaints from parents. We have also sent our officials in many schools for inspection and found that parents did not report there.""

One parent says he and his ward reported and were turned away. ""I have been making rounds to Panchsheel Public School in Badarpur since March for the admission of my six-year-old son.

He has been applying to enrol his son in a private school under the EWS category for the last three years.

""He will exceed the age limit if he does not get admission this year,"" said Ahmed. Children over the age of six are not eligible for entry-level admission in the EWS category.

Officials at Panchsheel Public School said there are no seats on offer. ""We had only one vacancy for class I this year and we had informed the DoE about it. We do not have any vacant seat,"" said Bharti Mehta, principal of the school.

Similarly, Shiv Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Mehrauli, said his four-year-old son was denied admission in Deep Public School in Vasant Kunj. ""I was not even given a proper reason for the denial. An official said that there was no vacancy,"" he claimed Officials at the school, however, denied the charges saying that all students whose names appeared in the list were given admission.

Still, there are some instances where the children have not reported for admission. This reporter met some families which did not report for admission to the schools. Many said the school was far from home. ""I stay in north Delhi's Samaipur Badli and my four-year-old was assigned three schools in Dwarka, which is at the distance of 20 km from our house. How can we enrol our little one there?"" asked Jyoti Kumari, a homemaker.

As per norms, children must be assigned schools within 3km range of their residence for entry level classes.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of seats are to be reserved for the EWS category in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools.

As per the affidavits submitted by DoE in the Delhi high court, copies of which are with Hindustan Times, of 48,122 available EWS seats in private schools in Delhi, only 20,000 and 19,000 were filled in the last two academic sessions, 2017-18 and 2016-17, respectively.

DoE said it has set the target of filling at least 40,000 seats this year. ""We are yet to complete the final round of admission and hoping to fill over 40,000 seats this year,"" Goel said.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate in the Delhi high court said he has filed as many as 50 individual cases on behalf of the parents denied admission this academic session. ""This is a failure of DoE.

Experts working for the cause said that they have also approached to the Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia seeking his intervention.

Ahead of the new academic session, parents have expressed resentment against excessive tuition and admission fee charged by various private schools.

The parents have also accused Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) of not taking action against some schools despite repeated complaints. The allegations come in the wake of de-recognition of two private schools by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) for charging exorbitant fee.

Parents who have admitted their wards in Iqbal Memorial Institute (IMI) Bemina claimed that they had complained about the extra money charged by the school several times, but the Fee Fixation Committee didn't show any interest to address the issue.

""I admitted my son in the year 2015 and that time they charged me Rs 35,000 as admission fee. Presently the school is charging extra Rs 3900 as annual charges,"" said one of the parents wishing not to be identified.

""Earlier the school was charging Rs 2000 as monthly fee but after the FFC recommended them to charge just Rs 1890, the school adhered to the direction. Now again they are charging Rs 250 extra as computer fee and I am paying Rs 2150 a month including computer charges,"" he added.

Similarly, parents of those students who have admitted their kids in Kashmir Harvard Habak, complained that the school charged Rs 80,000 as admission fee besides charging Rs 3400 as monthly fee including transport charges.

One of the parents said that he admitted his daughter a few weeks late in the school and the authorities charged him extra money, saying that the school has increased the tuition fee.

""I am paying Rs 1500 for the 2nd standard student and more than Rs 1300 for 4th standard,"" he said.

Pertinently, the FFC has recommended Rs 1320 for 2nd standard.

Parents of those students, who have admitted their wards in Presentation Convent School, said they have paid Rs 70,000 as admission fee.

The parents also said that the tuition fee for a year is included in the admission fee.

According to one of the parents, who has admitted her ward in Presentation Convent Srinagar, in summers the school charges Rs 5090 as tuition fee for three months excluding transportation fee which is Rs 1500 per month.

""For winters the school is charging Rs 9120 tuition fee for three months which means we have are paying Rs 3040 per month excluding transportation charges,"" she said.

Similarly, as per sources Burn Hall School Srinagar also charges Rs 80,000 as admission fee.

""The admission fee is merely meant for the admissions; no tuition fee is included in admission fee.""

According to parents, the school charges Rs 2800 as monthly tuition fee in winters and over Rs 2600 in summers.

""In winters we are paying Rs 8,600 as tuition fee for three months excluding transport fee which is Rs 4800 and for the summers we are paying above Rs 8,000 excluding transport fee.""

Parents said Delhi Public School (DPS) Srinagar is charging Rs 1.10 lakh as admission fee.

One of the parents, Tahir Ahmad Dar (name changed) said his ward is studying in UKG and the school authorities are charging Rs 2750 as monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 monthly bus fee.

His two other kids are studying in 8th standard and 5th standard and he is paying Rs 4250 monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 bus fee for both classes.

According to FFC, the Linton Hall School in Rajbagh is supposed to charge Rs 1200 per month for the students of UKG to 10th standard as tuition fee.

However, top officials of FFC said they are they are charging Rs 1350 more as monthly tuition fee.

The FFC official said they have recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee for RP School, ""but they started charging Rs 1900 which also resulted in the suspension of its recognition"".

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora is charging Rs 83,000 as admission fee for the new entrants of nursery class and KG-I.

Sources told Rising Kashmir that the school has different charges for admission as the school is charging Rs 48,000 as admission fee for students getting admitted in 11th standard in which school is taking tuition fee from the admission fee for a year.

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora had been recommended Rs 2520 for KG-I, Rs 2140 for KG-II, Rs 1700 for the Ist class to 8th standard and Rs 1950 for the 9th and 10th standard.

For the 11th standard, the FFC allowed the school to charge Rs 3255 for medical students and Rs 3015 for Arts students and for 12th standard the school had been allowed to charge Rs 3580 for the medical students and Rs 3320 for Arts students.

The FFC official said the school was violating norms and will not reclaim recognition unless they adhere to its guidelines.

The parents of those wards who are studying in Foundation World School said they are being charged Rs 50,000 as admission fee.

Parent of one of the wards said, ""My kid is studying in the nursery class and I am paying Rs 8000 monthly fee including Rs 6000 tuition fee and Rs 2000 transport fee.""

Parents of those wards who are studying in GD Goenka Srinagar said the school charged Rs 1 lakh earlier for new admissions and Rs 7,000 as monthly fee including the bus charges.

Another parent whose two kids are studying in Biscoe School said he is paying Rs 2730 for 4th standard and Rs 2760 for 8th standard.

Officials in FFC said they lack manpower and cannot monitor each and every private school.

""There are more than two thousand private schools in the valley and we don't have that much of manpower available with us. This committee was formed a few years back and it will take time to upgrade it,"" he said.

When contacted, the chairperson and officials of FFC did not respond to repeated calls and messages from this reporter.

Director School Education Kashmir, GN Itoo said the complaints against any school received by FFC are being taken seriously and necessary action will be taken immediately.

""Recently FFC has issued a circular in which they have asked all private schools to reveal their current fee structure, admission fee and transportation fee as well and once they will get the details from schools, it will be decided by DSEK as to what should be done with the violators,"" he said.

Itoo further said the FFC has sought help from DSEK also. ""And we have assured them that nodal officers from CEO office will help them at the district level.""

years of 2016-17 and 2017-18, an analysis has shown.

The analysis, commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), was carried out by Indus Action, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) working towards implementation of Section 12(1)(C) of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clause mandates that private, unaided schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats in entry-level classes for EWS/DG category students.

The data for the analysis was obtained from the Directorate of Education (DoE).

According to the report filed by the NGO, 48 private schools did not admit any student under the quota in 2016-17 while seven schools registered no admissions under the category in 2017-18. Additionally, about 19 private schools did not admit a single child in both years.

""One of the things asked by the DCPCR to the NGO was to analyse and list the schools who had not given admission to a single child under the quota despite allotment of the seats with them,"" member of DCPCR Anurag Kundu said.

The commission has asked for the phone number of parents allotted seats under the quota, along with reasons recorded by these schools for not admitting them from the DoE.

""All this has been requested to corroborate the claims, by both parents and the school... and to find what the truth is and then initiate an enquiry accordingly,"" Kundu added.

The DoE was not available for comment when approached by the Sunday Standard.

""Private schools are primarily are not interested in giving admissions to children belonging to the EWS and DG category. The improper monitoring by the education department has further given them

leverage to deny admission,"" said Advocate and social activist Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist which fights for people belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group.

""The purpose of carrying the analysis was to send show cause notice to such private schools. It appeared some of these schools in Delhi outrightly denied. Some cited 1:3 rule and others cited invalidity of income or caste certificates as reasons for not admitting children under the reservation,"" Tushar Bhadwar of Indus

Action said."

Apart from the backbreaking process of admissions, the money deposited as 'admission fee' is not even tax-free.

With passing years, the government taxes are only increasing in the valley. From eateries to earnings to the money people spend, everything comes with a tax. ""For what we have, we can pay the taxes. But for what we already spent, how can they ask for tax?"" asks a parent Tawheed Ahmad who recently got his kin admitted in a reputed private school in Srinagar.

After a baby is born, one looks at its face and thinks about the number of classes he/she has to study. People wait for the baby to start talking so that they can send them to a playschool where they can learn alphabets, rhymes, words, numbers, puzzles, games, colours and how to talk in English. This time is 'crucial' for the child as it will decide whether the child can get admitted in a reputed school or not.

""We tried to teach our child at home but in a play school, they learn discipline and exactly the things that will be asked in their interview,"" says Ahmad.

Ahmad had sent his ward to a playschool at the age of 3. ""He would still be sleeping when we would wake him up. He would cry a lot before leaving for the playschool. He would sleep for hours after coming back. This is the necessity of time,"" he explains adding that he had to pay around Rs. 2000 per month as the fees of the playschool for 2 years.

As soon as the news about the availability of school forms came, Ahmad and his wife like thousands of other parents in Kashmir ran to schools in the middle of the night, lining in a queue to grab a form.

""We went to many schools. I sent my brother to some places, me and my wife went to Tyndale Biscoe School. It was around 3 in the morning. There were already 3-4 parents waiting outside the school. We waited and waited. We had taken Namkeen Chai with us. We had breakfast on the road and finally the gate opened,"" he recalls.

After submitting the form, he says, the family would be after the child, asking him all sorts of questions like, ""What is your name, What is your father's name? What is your mother's name? Etc.""

All's well that ends well. The child gets admitted into the school. But that is not the end of the story. For admission in a government school, at the pre-Nursery level, one has to pay nothing.

For admissions in any reputed private school, one has to pay: Rs 25000 at Legends School, Rs 50000 at World Foundation School, Rs 85000 at Green Valley Educational Institute, Rs 80 to 75 thousand at Tyndale Biscoe School and Burhall School; Rs 1 Lakh 5 thousand (Minus Rs 9000/ Rs 6000 Annual Fees) at Doon International School, Rs 50000 at World Foundation School, Rs 93000 at Delhi Public School and around Rs One Lakh at GD Goenka.

""We had started saving even before he was born. But, even that is somehow not enough as we have to pay taxes for the amount of money we pay as admission fees. While paying the taxes on our earnings, we can only show the receipt of the tuition fees,"" says Tawheed.

""It has been going on for years. This is exploitation. First, the schools suck our blood and then the government,"" he adds.

A Chartered Accountant from the valley says, ""We as CA's do not go into the reasoning part of the laws. It is the forte of the lawmakers who draft these laws. I think only the tuition fee is considered as the admission fees is usually hefty. If they, exempt the admission fees, their tax revenue will go down. Also, they frame the policies considering who can and cannot pay taxes.""

School owners and even principals feel this should be a voluntary exercise as almost every student in such schools is already following a proper vaccination schedule through their private paediatrician.

While no one wanted to speak officially, schools felt that this mass vaccination should be optional. ""Parents themselves are vary of having their child take any kind of vaccination without their own doctor's supervision. And this tendency is not just limited to the upper middle or rich class now, because everyone has access to a paediatrician and regularly inoculate their children,"" said a school trustee.

Another trustee, who also owns a college, said that the mass vaccination programme is perfect for students in NMC and zilla parishad schools as 'they may not have access to private health care'. ""I fully support the government's initiative and it must focus on students who are normally deprived of such immunization programmes. I am sure there would even be private unaided schools in city whose students would be in need of this important vaccine, hence the best option would be for government to contact schools and seek parents' consent,"" he said.

Officials who are part of the immunization drive say there is no question of taking consent for this. Dr Mohd. Sajid, who's part of the core team looking after the drive in Nagpur, said, ""It's like chlorination of drinking water, no consent is necessary. Also it does not matter if child has taken two doses in advance, as this is as additional dose. In fact I have discussed this issue with a few schools and told them to inform parents, but there is no mention of parental consent even in the government guideline.""

He added that the drive must be viewed as a 'community level' health intervention. ""If even a single child is left behind then he could be a potential carrier of the virus,"" said Dr Sajid.

But a principal told TOI that getting consent from parents is crucial. ""Parents nowadays are very aware and aggressive when it comes to rights of their children, and we can't fault them for that. Already a handful of parents are approaching teachers and wanting to know if the school will allow the immunization programme. And I am sure by this month's end every single parent will be asking that question,"" she said. In April this year, almost 40 schools in Gurugram too refused to participate in it in the immunization drive, citing lack of consent of parents.

Paediatricians in city are already giving out MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) combo vaccination to children and it is part of the schedule chart too. A school principal said, ""Since private doctors are already giving the vaccine, I feel parents in top schools will keep their kids away from the mass vaccination drive."""

It's a turn off on a different level altogether when there is a national holiday and they are still supposed to attend classes.

Gandhi Jayanti, India's National Holiday is one such holiday for students of some private educational institutions in Kashmir. There is no alternative for them and the authorities despite knowing fail to address the issue.

While the government offices, educational institutions and banks stay closed today to celebrate Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's birthday, also celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence, some private educational institutions including Doon International (DIS), Presentation Convent (PCS), New Convent and Oasis School continue to work today. While students were called to DIS and PCS, in some other schools the teachers were called up to do the 'paperwork'.

""We received a message from the school yesterday informing that the school will remain closed on 1st October and that 2nd October will be a regular working day,"" says a parent who ward studies in DIS.

Adding, he asks, ""This is not the only time when they have opposed the government order. When the government declares summer or winter holidays, they make sure to stretch the working days by 10 to 15 days. Gandhi Jayanti is a National Holiday! If we are following all rules that Delhi frames, why not holidays?""

The parent had also approached the authorities once by lodging a complaint in Chief Minister's Grievance Cell regarding announcing of winter vacations in accordance with government orders. However, he says, ""Probably, the school has 'influences'. That is how they survive despite opposing the government orders.""

He says that he never received a response from the cell. However, some government official had been to the school after some days which again, ""was of no use.""

""They went there for inspection and still they closed the school after 3 days of the inspection. And guess what! No action was taken against them!"" he exclaims.

""Who are they to decide when to declare a holiday and when not to? My child would have really enjoyed the holiday at home. Now, this Jayanti makes no difference to her,"" he adds.

When asked why they keep opposing the norms, the Administrative In-charge DIS told Free Press Kashmir that the school had been closed on 1st October as a day before it had celebrated its Annual Day.

""We had celebrated our Annual Day a day before. The teachers and students were tired. So, we decided to keep Monday a holiday,"" said Mehnaz, Manager DIS. When told that the school cannot bend the rules as per their convenience, she says, ""This is for the first time that we have kept the school running on a National holiday. Otherwise, we frame out holidays as per the government order. This time, due to the Annual Day celebrations, the students had already missed classes. We needed to recover that as well.""

As far as other schools are concerned, the faculty says that they are called to school even if there is not much to do there.

""There are no students in the school. Still, we have been called to make lesson plans and do some paperwork,"" says a faculty member from Oasis School, on condition of anonymity.

""It's not that we don't want to work or that we only look for excuses to stay home. But, it's our right to stay home when there is a holiday,"" the teacher adds.

TRSMA had given a bandh call protesting against the State government's decision making it mandatory for the schools to obtain No Objection Certificates from fire department, traffic control and the corporation.

While parents criticised the move and called it a ploy by the schools to further pressurise the government from acting against them in their massive profiteering, teachers were unhappy that exam schedule had to be adjusted due to the bandh.

Glendale Academy, Chirec, Future Kids, Kalpa, Brilliant High School, Slate the School and Kennedy High the Global School were among the schools which were shut on Friday, either supporting the bandh call or declared holiday as a precautionary measure.

Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) condemned the bandh call for not just disrupting academic schedule but also involving the students in a fight that's not theirs.HSPA in a statement said that it was ""unbelievable... that a government which is supporting school managements on the gross violation of every single norm related to regulation of schools and fees charged would not be looking into these issues raised by schools.""

Ashish Naredi, a parent, said that schools are projecting that parents and teachers are supporting their demands.""This is false and if schools are so concerned about the welfare then they should they implement GO MS 1 and give 50 per cent of the fee as salaries to teachers and constitute parents teachers association. But all they do is muzzle teachers voices if they protest by sacking them and that of parents by harassing students,"" he said.

Given the mind-boggling scale of the demand, the private sector's participation is definitely a welcome move. India has one of the world's largest higher education systems, but it is still not adequate. Since 2003, India has apparently been adding more than 1,000 private colleges every year. Lacking in quality control, this expansion did not quite contribute to skill development or boost the nation's 'knowledge economy', and the private sector mostly remained the second-rate, fallback option for the desperate. As the number of 'educated' unemployed kept on growing, some of these teaching shops died their natural death.

In recent years, however, some old private brands have been re-inventing themselves, with fresh investments in quality faculty and research, scholarships and so on. The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent philanthropic interventions. More such interventions are needed for paradigm-shifting experimentation towards excellence, which the government often cannot risk as it spends taxpayers' money and is hence bound by safe rules. Students in Indian institutions have traditionally studied subjects in silos, as the system mostly did not allow for the multidisciplinary and int­erdisciplinary approach to learning.

The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent ­philanthropic ­interventions.

Realising much ahead of the herd that real problems need real solutions, the Shiv Nadar University started in 2011 with a multidisciplinary, 'liberal studies' curriculum, offering an excellent mix of science, engineering and social science teaching and research. One can't be a problem-solving engineer, for example, without understanding the social context. Similarly, policy-making on key iss­ues often needs to be science-driven -- a slightly expensive proposition, as cutting-edge science and technology research often needs heavy resources. But there cannot be any short-cuts if we wish to deliver what is needed.

Learning has to be curiosity-driven and enjoyable. The 'liberal studies' app­roach allows learners to experiment and find their passion. With the job market changing fast, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are key skills we need to impart. In the new institutions, curriculum content is dynamic and flexible, and the mode of delivery active or participatory, with students 'learning by doing'. Even undergraduate students are encouraged to grasp the nua­nces of research and innovation, while we stre­ngthen their foundation with a broad multidisciplinary approach and provide a depth of learning in a major subject.

And yet a growing number of fee-paying Indian students go abroad even at the undergraduate level -- the high cost is not a deterrent. While 'reputation management' is a serious issue, to build people's trust in India being a safe and welcoming country, we need to go for ser­ious accreditation and benchmarking of our institutions to make our country a higher-education destination. We need to hold all the institutions accountable in a transparent, fair and progressive manner. Private institutions have strong ­in-built internal accountability. We should bring in healthy competition to the public- and private-funded universities. Global rankings are one way, but their focus on uniformity of parameters may narrow the diversity that universities need for innovation in every sphere -- in strategy, curricula, pedagogy and research. We should find and retain some unique advantages of the Indian higher education system.

The country urgently needs a global and contextual vision plan, and a competent leadership with the necessary res­ources to carry the plan through. The system needs to be rebuilt with strong, equitable and credible partnerships -- national and international, academic and industrial, public and private -- bes­ides intra-institution (interdisciplinary) to inter-institution collaborations for inn­ovation and research excellence, capacity-­building and training the trainers, better teaching tools, enhancing students' employability, and connecting education to issues of livelihood and sustainability of future generations. This is the only way forward.

""We have now received guidelines from the state government and the committee will be set up soon,"" Singh said.

The UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath government on April 3, 2018, and signed by the governor on April 9. And on August 30, the ordinance was replaced with a law that was passed by a voice vote in the state assembly.

According to provisions of the Act, which covers all private CBSE, ICSE and state board-affiliated schools, all private schools that charge more than Rs 20,000 annually will have to revise their fee structure for all classes so as to bring down the financial burden on parents.

Moreover, admission fee can be charged only twice -- when a student joins school and after they complete Class X and seek admission for Class XI, according to the Act.

Schools also can't change uniform for five years. Fees charged by a school during 2015-16 will be the basis for implementing the regulation, the Act states.

Apart from the district magistrate, the committee will have a chartered accountant, a PWD executive engineer-rank official and a senior official from the UP State Finance and Accounts Services. It will also include a representative of parents association, a principal or manager of a self-financed school and the district inspector of schools.

Once the committee is set up in the district, officials said, it will address the complaints by parents regarding arbitrary fee hike and also work on putting a cap of the upper limits of fees that private schools can charge. Schools can be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh on first and second offence, respectively. Following this, it can be de-recognised.

""If private schools have to submit NOCs from fire and traffic departments as well as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation for safety purposes, the same should also be implemented for government schools. They can't mandate something like this in the name of safety only for private schools.

As soon as the schools decided to postpone exams and suspend classes, Chatterjee issued a diktat to keep their schedule unchanged. The school authorities, however, declined to comment.

Chatterjee pointed out they might might be affiliated to ICSE or CBSE, but the schools had to take NOCs from the state. ""We have never interfered in any unfortunate incident, which had happened in some of the schools. They could have taken suggestions from the school education department. We have issued a circular to keep the schools open. Despite our requests, if some schools decide to defy our orders, we shall probe the activities of private schools affiliated to other boards, which we have not done till now,"" the minister said.

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh muddled the issue further: ""Who will take the responsibility if buses do not ply and something untoward happens on the streets? If parents decide to send their kids to school, who is the minister to say no?"""

It had nominated executive engineers Bhoop Singh and Rameshwar Das for schools falling under Estate Office 1, whereas executive engineers Shweta Sharma and Anil Kumar were appointed for those under Estate Office 2. Officials, however, have confirmed that none of the schools has included them in their committees. It is because of this reason that the HSVP has issued notices to 34 schools.

Earlier, the urban authority had taken similar action against three major private hospitals in the city asking them to furnish details of EWS patients treated by them as per the policy.

Officials of the Directorate of School Education are of the view that Aadhaar based biometric attendance would also aid in preparing Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data with ease. According to the statistics available with the directorate, about 11,262 private unaided schools are functioning in the State with 31,19,525 enrolments.

The recent gang rape of a girl in a Dehradun school has once again raised questions regarding safety and security of schoolchildren. Known for their quality of education, private schools in Uttarakhand attract students from all over the country. However, there are visible gaps in formation, implementation and monitoring of safety measures in the private schools.

SC Guidelines

As per the Supreme Court guidelines on child safety in schools, a school management should install sufficient CCTV cameras on campus, facing road and and periphery. When a team of Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) inspected the school where the gang rape took place, it did not find CCTV cameras in hostels. The UCPCR team also found that the girls' hostel, housing 22 students, did not have any warden for a month.

The Supreme Court guidelines also state that all areas of the school premises should be regularly monitored and any unauthorised person should be questioned for their presence. School management is also required to appoint some staff as vigilance monitors on rotation to keep an eye on all activities of students. However, these are guidelines. A set of non-negotiable child safety conditions for schools is still awaited.

Accountability

Welham Boys' School principal Guneet Bindra said, ""When parents leave their children in a residential school, school authorities become their pseudo parents. We have to care for each and every child as our own. This includes taking care of their health, hygiene, safety and well-being.""

Bindra said negligence of any kind by a school in the safety of a child is unacceptable. ""Internal security of a school is vital and cannot be compromised.""

Safety in schools

In October last year, the principals' progressive school association (PPSA) issued a safety advisory to all its 176 member schools of Dehradun. These included installing CCTV cameras and their regular monitoring, police verification of all employees, advising parents not to drop off their children to school too early or pick them up too late and an entry system of each student, preferably in the form of biometric. The advisory also stated that no area of the school should be left unattended.

""The members of the association meet annually to discuss issues of safety and security of the children. We also ensure that all the member schools follow the guidelines that we have laid down,"" president of PPSA Prem Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

""However, the school where this unfortunate incident took place is not a member of PPSA and I have never visited the campus as well. So I do not know how they were operating,"" Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

Case of ICSE schools

Jennifer Kumar, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) school association's state president, said: ""ICSE has issued guidelines for safety of students, which we abide by. There are periodic inspections by members of the council to monitor the same."" She said security of a student was of 'paramount importance', irrespective of which examination board the school is affiliated with."

Days after the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) issued a suspension notice against two private schools here the Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) Tuesday said they have received fresh complaints against some more private schools for charging exorbitant fee in violation of its directives.

Chairman of FFC, Justice (Retd) Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain said the committee has received some new complaints against private schools for violating its recommended fee structure.

Hussain said FFC has received complaints from the parents of students enrolled in Minto Circle School, Srinagar who are 'violating' the FFC norms by charging exorbitant fee from them.

Meanwhile another member of FFC wishing anonymity told Rising Kashmir that it has received a complaint from the parents against Linton Hall School, Rajbagh for the same issue.

According to FFC, they have recommended Rs 1200 for Linton Hall School, Rajbagh but in violation of norms the school is charging Rs 1350 per month.

When asked about the recent suspension orders to RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh, Hussain said, ""We had informed both the school authorities to charge only recommended fee, but they did not adhere to that. The complaints of those schools were received by FFC and DSEK.""

The parents of various schools told Rising Kashmir that they want to register complaints against the private schools who violate the norms of FFC but they are unaware of the process to do so. The parents said they want to know whether they can file complaints online.

However, the chairman of FFC blamed the parents for not filing complaints against those schools who are violating FFC guidelines. ""We cannot act against any school till we have a genuine complaint or proof against it. In today's meeting we have told our Chief Education Officers (CEO) to conduct inspection of all schools who are violating the FFC norms,"" FFC chairman said.

Replying to a query he said, ""All the private schools are violating the norms but only those are caught and highlighted against whom the complaints have been filed by the parents. Parents fear reprisal but we assure them their complaints are kept confidential.""

FFC Chairman added that they have regulated the tuition fee structure of various prominent schools which includes DPS Srinagar, Presentation Convent, Mallinson and Tyndale Biscoe School, Burn Hall School and many other schools.

He said the missionary schools like Biscoe and Mallinson charge Rs 35,000 as admission fee and for the whole year they charge Rs 85,000 which includes tuition fee, transport fee and other charges as well.

""RP School or Green Valley cannot be compared with DPS Srinagar because the Supreme Court in its guidelines had mentioned that the school with more facilities can charge accordingly,"" Hussain said.

He further said that for RP School FFC has recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee but they are charging Rs 1900 which is a violation of FFC guidelines.

""Similarly, Green Valley Educational Institute has a good amount of surplus money and that is why we told them that why they are charging more than what FFC has recommended,"" he added."

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement."

The department of school education, Kashmir has de-recognised two prominent private schools in downtown Srinagar on September 15.

However, the decision has turned out to be controversial as parents of the schoolchildren claim that it could damage the academic career of their kids. The schools facing the axe are RP School and Green Valley Educational Institute located in Malla Bagh, an area in downtown Srinagar.

Although the reason mentioned by the education department officials behind the de-recognition is the exorbitant fee charged by the school management, a section of the parents allege that the decision by the administration could be a crackdown on schools that are teaching Islamic moral education.

The posts on social media in support of the school administrations have now gone viral. This indicates that the present state administration may be opposed to the idea of teaching Islamic education in valley schools.

Social media users posted pictures of the students offering Namaz (Islamic prayers) and women teachers and students clad in Hijab and Burqa on school premises. They also claimed that the state administration under the garb of exorbitant fees did not want the preaching of Islamic practices among students.

""Fee hikes are a norm in all big schools. But singling out a school where Islamic education in being taught, where zuhr prayer is a must. It is disgraceful. In RP we trust. I am proud I have spent few of my years in RP. My future daughter is going to RP,"" Aafan Hakak tweeted.

A post which lays down fees sturucture of various eminent schools in the state, which includes Christian missionary schools besides others, said that the two schools which faced de-recognition comparatively charged lesser fees.

""These schools which face the suspension charge only half the amount of montly fees compared to the missionary schools and other elite institutions which are run by affluent people. This is a selective decision and there is a greater design to regulate the religious teachings among students,"" a parent, under the condition of anonymity, said.

A medico, Masood Rashid whose children are studying in RP School wrote on Fcaebook, ""I strongly condemn biased and selective action by DSEK against RP School Malabagh...My children are reading in same school...Fee structure is less than other schools or equal...I want to know who are these self-styled parent association...Who has given them consent...Who made them representatives...These self styled association people are actually extortionists and their only aim is to get extrabenifits for their own children...They usually blackmail school authorities...DSEK and pseudo parent representatives are fully responsible for whatever trauma to out-going students and their parents....""

Director School Education has also called for adjusting the enrolled students of these schools in nearby Government schools for ensuing examination. Itoo has also cautioned all the heads of the private institutions not to hike the fee on their own and comply with the instructions and orders from the department, in letter and spirit. Though slammed for being harsh in some quarters, the decision has come as a shot in the arm of the parents who are otherwise largely taken for granted by the management of the private schools and made to pay through their nose. So, the extreme action by the government is certain to lend them some sense of empowerment. And in future they won't find themselves solely at the mercy of the school managements who don't shy away from forcing the parents to pay up the entire fees even in times of disasters like the 2014 deluge. One could hope that the government action reigns in the private schools which have otherwise become a law unto themselves.

Last year, the state government's school fee fixation committee has given a nod to the enhancement of fee structure of private educational institutions by eight percent. The order issued in October last is valid for three years. The decision came after the J&K High Court directed the state government to frame a policy regarding annual fee enhancement. But as the derecognized two schools would have us believe, the government's orders are observed largely in breach. The schools would easily get away with their arbitrary fee hikes, cocking a snook at the government. And parents are in no position to resist this.

But again the people are bound to watch Itoo's order with some scepticism. Will the new action succeed where the previous initiatives have failed? Only time will tell. But the outcome of the past interventions should hardly detract from the significance of the fresh measure. Director School Education has the power to get private schools to fall in line. He is in a position to withdraw the recognition should schools refuse to do his bidding as he has now practically demonstrated.

Ideally, the private schools, especially the elite schools, should have taken the lead and in a spirit of mutual understanding worked with the parents to fix a mutually agreed amount of fees. But this isn't happening. And now the government has taken a note of this arbitrary state of affairs and acted with suspension of the recognition of the two schools.

On Saturday, School Education minister KA Sengottaiyan, announced that separate mark sheets each for 600 marks will be issued for Classes 11 and 12. He also said Class 12 mark sheet alone will be enough for higher education. ""We received complaints that students get too stressed and are unable to deal with the pressure. In order to ease the pressure on students, we decided that only Class 12 marks will be sufficient for higher education,"" the minister told reporters on Saturday.

The government last year, introduced board exams for Class 11 and a consolidated mark sheet, to ensure that schools do not give unequal importance to Class 12. The composite mark sheets of both years put together was brought in, as students performed poorly in first year of college, which is based on Class 11 syllabus.

""In government schools, we always give equal importance to both Class 11 and 12. But, private schools rush through the first year, give importance to Class 12 exams and score better and make it to the better colleges,"" said KPO Suresh, president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers' Association, adding that this may even lead to students migrating to private schools.

""Students who go to private schools have better exposure and can get privately coached for competitive exams. School is the only exposure for government school students. When Class 11 public exam's importance is reduced, students will not have incentive to study well,"" he said.

However, teachers from private schools welcomed the decision. ""Simply knowing that their higher education will depend on only 600 marks and not 1,200 marks will reduce a lot of stress on them,"" said A Mayavan, a history teacher."

Warning strict action against private schools in Uttarakhand prescribing non-NCERT books, the director general of primary education department has said it may even lead to cancellation of their no-objection certificates (NOCs).

On Thursday, the department served notices to 186 private schools of the state affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) in this regard. The state government had taken a decision earlier this year to make books by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) compulsory for all private CBSE schools of the state. This decision was also backed by the high court in April.

Alok Shekhar Tiwari, director general of primary education, said: ""This matter will not be taken lightly. We have issued notices to these schools and have sought their reply. The schools have acted against the high court verdict, which is contempt of court and we will bring this to the court's notice.

We will also seek the court's guidelines on further action. If the court so instructs, we will withdraw the NOCs of these schools and will register an FIR against them as well.""

CBSE grants affiliation to a school only if it has an NOC by the state government. Tiwari said the department cannot proceed in the matter independently as it is sub-judice.

In its judgment, the court had said that if a school is prescribing books from private publishers, they should be at par with the NCERT books in terms of quality and cost. Schools cannot prescribe books from private publishers which cost more than NCERT books.

After receiving several complaints from the parents, education minister Arvind Pandey constituted nodal officers in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to survey all the private schools in their respective districts and identify the defaulters.

The officers found 186 out of 226 private schools in violation of the high court order.

""The schools have been trying to defend themselves by saying that the books by private publishers are for their library but it is baseless. If these books are for the library, then why have the parents been made to buy them in addition to the NCERT books? This has led to extra financial burden on the parents,"" Tiwari said.

Deputy director, primary education, Jitendra Saxena, said: ""We have served notices to these schools on the basis of nine points. The schools are supposed to display the rates of the books on their websites but most of them have not done so. Many don't even have a website."""

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), said many of these initiatives were ""unscientific and not practical"".

Other members of the All Boards Association, which includes State board as well as CBSE schools, too were of the same opinion.

Homework

B.R. Supreeth, office-bearer of the Management of Independent CBSE Schools, said schools had evolved homework to ensure it was only a recap of the things learnt in the classroom. ""Teachers do not ask students to write impositions like how they used to do earlier. We give meaningful homework that supplements classroom learning. The State government should not ban homework,"" he said.

Mr. Shashi Kumar said it was not practical for all schools to have a locker facility for students. ""The department can recommend that schools have lockers so that students can keep their belongings. But this cannot be imposed on budget private schools,"" he said.

He said the government had not considered their inputs before evolving various policies. School managements are willing to implement no bag day once a month, he added. He urged the department to declare second Saturday as holiday for students so that they get time to spend with their family.

CM's intervention sought

Private school managements sought the Chief Minister's intervention, claiming that Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh was not available to listen to their grievances.

""There are several issues pertaining to reimbursement of RTE quota admissions and supply of textbooks that need to be addressed. We have tried contacting the Minister at least 25 times, and he has refused to give us time to discuss our concerns,"" Mr. Shashi Kumar said."

Private school managements and the State government were at loggerheads over the fee structure, as it had not been revised for 18 years.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We are all now complying with the fee structure and all our member schools will display it from December.""

He said the move aims to bring in accountability and transparency. This has been the long-standing demand of parents. Schools that do not comply with the fee structure can be penalised up to ₹10 lakh.

For several years, school managements have been violating the fee structure policy, terming it ""archaic"".

According to the new fee structure, besides recurring costs, school managements can charge an additional fee that differs based on the location -- ranging from 70% of the recurring fee in gram panchayat and town panchayat limits to about 100% in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike areas. The special development fee has been raised to ₹2,500 from ₹600. Schools also are not allowed to hike the fees by more than 15% from the previous academic year.

A biannual Vitamin A supplementation programme will also be implemented during the period.

As per the ninth annual status of education report 2014, 29 per cent of total enrolments at the national level are in private schools. In Odisha, the percentage of private school admissions is 8.5. The drive will be conducted in 27 districts and aligned with mass drug administration in the rest three lymphatic districts of Cuttack, Khurda and Dhenkanal. Children from one to five years of age will be administered Albendazole suspension and those in the age bracket of six to 19 will be given tablet.

Worms can cause anaemia and nutritional impairment, thereby affecting mental and physical development.

As estimated by the national centre for disease control, the STH rate in Odisha is 38 per cent. Parasitic infections result from poor sanitation as well as unhygienic conditions and are easily transmitted to children through contact with infected soil. A health official said mass deworming leads to significant improvement in outcomes related to education, career choice, earnings and long-term well being. Since the consequences of chronic worm infection in children are widespread and debilitating and kids with high intensity of STH infection are too sick to concentrate in schools or Anganwadi centres, dewo r ming is an important intervention to combat malnutrition, he said.

A group of researchers have recommended this following their study that shows one out of every 10 students of Delhi's private schools suffer from obesity, high blood pressure and increased levels of bad cholesterol.

Together, these risk factors make them vulnerable to develop a host of non-communicable diseases, primarily cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. They are the major cause of adult mortality and illness worldwide.

The students of government schools, who come from lower socio-economic strata, are relatively less vulnerable to get these diseases, the study conducted by researchers from AIIMS, Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Institute of Health Management and Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says. It has been published in Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR).

The research involved screening of 1369, 786 boys and 543 girls -- studying in grades II and XI in 10 randmly selected private schools and nine government schools.

The percentage of overweight and obese students among private schools was 13% and 9% respectively. Among the government school students, only 3% students were found to be overweight and none of them were found to be obese. Number of underweight students in government schools was, however, noted to be three times that of the private school students.

Hypertension and bad cholesterol, risk factors usually associated with increasing age and unhealthy lifestyle, was also found to be affecting the students.

In the study, the prevalence of hypertensive students in private schools was 13% and in government schools it was 4.5%. Monika Arora, the lead author of the study told TOI, this is the first research to report on the distribution of multiple risk factors for NCDs in school students in India, comparing low socio-economic status (government schools) to high socio-economic status (private schools).

""Private school students had 29 times the prevalence of obese students compared to government schools,"" she said. Arora blamed sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating for the increased risk and stressed on the need for comprehensive, school-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyle among them.

Harvard School of Public Health has, in a study on economic losses due to non-communicable diseases, has estimated the economic burden of these ailments for India will be close to $6.2 trillion for 2012-30, a figure that is nearly nine times the total health expenditure during the previous 19 years of $710 billion."

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders! Every since the boring school became a 'train school' dropout rates have frozen, say authorities. Also, they are seeing a sudden jump in attendance rate. Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment.

A survey that assessed students across 20 states revealed that 9 in 10 children in urban private schools cannot read in English.

The report, 'Where India reads 2017-18', covered 19,765 children of classes IV, V and VI in 106 private schools in cities, across 20 states, including Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir among others.

The survey conducted by Stones2Milestones, an organisation that aims to address the reading and learning levels of school going students. This was reviewed by Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER).

The report suggests that problem lies within our households. ""English is a second or even third language, in several Indian households and children speak in their mother tongue which is either Hindi or a regional language. However, at school they are expected to learn a language which is foreign to them, in a formal setting.""

Nikhil Saraf, co-founder, Stones2Milestones, said, ""The test was conducted online to check comprehension, vocabulary and reading habits of students under their teachers' supervision. Some students answered a few test items in an unreasonably short time. Since it is unlikely for a small child to read and respond in snap of a finger, we did not count for scoring.""

""This also points to several behavioural peculiarities, which could include reading fatigue, non-seriousness and bad monitoring practices.""

The schools were provided with a list of suggestions and actions needed to improve reading levels based on the assessment report.

""The focus should be to make reading to the core as a learning focus rather than just restrict it to a namesake library period,"" said Kavish Gadia, co-founder and CEO, Stones2Milestones.

Christel R Devadaswon, head, Department of English, University of Delhi, said, ""A policy is required to improve the literacy rate and stakeholders should look at the perspective of children and their socioeconomic situations.""

Venita Kaul, ex-senior education specialist and chairperson of the Advisory Committee of Center for Early Childhood Education and Development (CECED), said, ""I hope this report will initiate a discussion on challenges many Indian children face due to multi-lingual environment at home. It will sensitise parents, teachers and other stakeholders regarding the need to revisit classroom pedagogy for teaching reading to children. This is an urgent need in primary schools since children learn best in ways more developmentally and contextually appropriate for them. Once that is done, future assessments of children's reading skills will undoubtedly present a more favourable picture of their reading levels."""

""It is highly unfortunate that our fellow principal and two teachers of a school in East Delhi were arrested by the police on the basis of false allegations. They spent 35 days in jail. The investigations have not found any evidence against the teachers as well as the principal. It is highly unfortunate that the principal and teachers have been arrested in this manner,"" said a statement by Affordable Private Schools' Association.

The police had arrested the principal and two teachers of a private school in Mayur Vihar in July, four months after a 15-year-old girl committed suicide alleging harassment. The girl -- a student of Class 9 -- committed suicide at her residence on March 20 in Noida sector 52.

The family members had alleged that she was under stress due to her poor performance in two subjects in the exams.

""There are so many cases and instances that the police have arrested teachers and principals in unproven allegations and false charges. It is a matter of shame for our society in which without knowing the facts and circumstances of the case, parents asked the immedi-ate arrest of the principal and teachers,"" the statement said.

""Therefore it has been decided by the members of the association that our fellow schools will not celebrate this Teachers day on 5th September, 2018 and we are ready to support any protest to uphold the respect, safety and security of our teachers,"" it added."

This is a 60 per cent increase above the average education expenditure and is financed by a reduction of expenditure on food, institutional medical care, entertainment among others.

These are some of the facts that were presented by two development researchers in a presentation titled ""How do Households Finance Private School Education?"" in an international conference on public policy and management organised by IIM, Bengaluru in New Delhi recently.

""We set out to analyse the financing patterns of private education by families because it's a common experience that even urban poor and low-income families in rural areas now prefer private schools over government schools,"" said Nishant Chadha of India Development Foundation, a researcher.

""And the findings so far, I would say, have been startling as families cut their other expenses significantly to ensure things like tuition, uniforms and recurrent fee that private schooling demands.""

The researchers used data from 68th round of National Sample Survey Office for the analysis The motivation for the analysis came from a 2015 Assocham survey which had said that nearly one in ten respondents indicated that the cost associated with schooling has actually affected even their choice of school.

Over 70 per cent of parents spend 30-40 per cent of take-home pay on their children education, placing a significant burden on their family budget, the survey had also found. ""While the annual fees are on average Rs 65,000 to Rs. 1,25,000 on a single child for regular schools, even the preschools for those aged 3 to 5 cost, parents about Rs 35,000 to Rs 75,000 a term,"" Assocham survey had said.

Bharti Nandwani of Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, another researcher with the project said that it was important to probe ""at what cost families make a choice that is considerably costlier."" ""Private schooling entails higher out-of-pocket expense so we wanted to understand how families manage to do that and how it affects their other needs and choices,"" she said. Chadha, however added that the findings are preliminary and more analyses needs to be done to ""answer a lot of other questions."
