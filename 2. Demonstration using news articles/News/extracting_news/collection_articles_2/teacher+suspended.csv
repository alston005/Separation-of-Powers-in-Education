""Why the Education Minister apologized, he did not do anything. It was the chief minister's fault and he should have apologised. It was the chief minister who insulted me,"" the teacher said.

On Thursday, Chief Minister Rawat directed the police to take Bahuguna into custody for allegedly protesting at his Janata Darbar session in Dehradun. The Chief Minister also ordered her suspension, after she allegedly used abusive language and showed indecency, while seeking a transfer from a remote location.

Talking to TOI on Saturday, Uttara Pant Bahuguna, who is posted as the principal of a primary school in Uttarkashi at present, said that she has been running from pillar to post seeking transfer to Dehradun considering her age and service in remote locations for decades. She added that she would also submit before the court that the CM's wife, Sunita Rawat, has been posted in Dehradun for 22 years without any transfer while scores of other teachers have not been permitted to be transferred to the plains even after serving in remote locations for several decades.

Bahuguna said, ""Even though I was denied justice and publicly humiliated in the janta durbar, I have full faith in our judiciary. I will approach the high court and present my grievances."" She also claimed that her salary had been stopped several months back. ""The allegations that I had been drawing salary and not reporting to work are baseless. My salary was stopped several months back and nobody is ready to listen to my plight,"" she added.

Meanwhile, her family is overwhelmed by the emotional support pouring out from all parts of the country through social media platforms.

Senior Supreme Court lawyer Kamini Jaiswal said, ""There is no doubt that the teacher's fundamental rights have been violated. Instead of considering her transfer on humanitarian grounds, suspending her is against the principles of natural justice."" ""Let the honourable court decide on the charges of misbehaviour. What is seen in the video clip is a brazen display of power and arrogance by the CM,"" she added.

Rawat had ordered the arrest and suspension of the school principal for allegedly using ""abusive language"" in front of him.

Defending the teacher, her son claimed that the video footage doing the rounds does not show the full picture. ""The video being circulated is incomplete. If you look at the entire footage, you will see how the CM spoke to my mother. It is his fault that he instigated her. They're saying a teacher shouldn't speak like that but a CM should also not speak like that,"" he said.

The incident happened on Thursday at the 'Janata Darbar' of the CM here when the principal of a government school in the Nagaon area of Uttarkashi district made a transfer request.

According to a government release, principal Uttara Bahuguna ""showed disrespect and used abusive language during the Janata Darbar. She was told to put forward her request in a decent manner but she kept on misbehaving.""

Bahuguna had requested the CM that she be transferred from the remote location. She claimed that she has been posted to remote locations for the last 25 years and now wanted to live with her children.

The woman said that her husband had died and she did not want to leave her children as ""orphans in Dehradun"". ""My condition is such that neither can I leave my children alone nor my job,"" Bahuguna said.

The back-and-forth grew heated as Ms Bahuguna insisted that the CM give her justice.

""I never signed up for exile all my life,"" Ms Bahuguna said. Annoyed, the CM asked her to ""mind her language"" and then shouted, ""Suspend karo ise abhi (Suspend her immediately). Arrest her.""

In a video clip, the teacher is seen screaming at the CM and shouting ""thief, cheats"" as she is led out of the meeting.

Uttara Bahuguna was arrested on charges of ""disrupting an important gathering"". She was let off in the evening.

After the incident, Rawat said that request for transfers must not be brought to a platform meant for hearing public grievances. ""All transfers of government employees will be done under the state's Transfer Act,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Uttarakhand Rajya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh Secretary General Digvijay Singh Chauhan said he would speak to the authorities and request them not to take any harsh action against her.

The state Congress said the CM's action was disappointing and argued if the wives of the BJP leaders could be given choice postings then why not Bahuguna."

Madurai: A woman assistant professor working in a private college at Aruppukkottai in Virudhunagar, who has been linked to the telephonic conversation has been suspended after four female students, who were on the receiving end of the 'offer' complained to higher authorities.

A phone conversation that took place on March 15 was recorded by the girls and has been doing the rounds in social media. The incident resurfaced on Sunday as a private Tamil news channel telecast the response of the faculty member to the complaint.

In the clip of a telephonic conversation, which lasts for close to 19 minutes, an assistant professor associated to the Mathematics Department of the Devanga Arts college in Virudhunagar is heard telling the women, whose identities have not been made public, that an 'opportunity' has come their way. And that they are expected to do certain things 'secretly' for a very senior official of the Madurai Kamaraj University (MKU) to which the college is affiliated.

In return for their cooperation Nirmala Devi tells them, ""On the academic side, I can take the four of you to a big level, I can assure you that. He is that big an official. I will make sure that your marks are not affected. You will get financial support and academic support also. I don't know if you will tell your parents or not. We will open an account for you and will put money for you.""

When the students ask her to elaborate on what needs to be done, she says, ""In order to finish some things successfully they are expecting college students. Till now, I have not gone down to that level. I can only say so much. I believe you will understand what they expect. If you accept this scheme, MKU will be your backbone.""

Meanwhile, secretary of the college R Ramasamy held a press conference on Sunday explaining the action taken by the college. He said the faculty member had gone to attend a refresher course in MKU on March 9.

As soon as the complaint was received, she was asked to report back to the college. As soon as she returned on March 21, the suspension order was handed over to her.

A committee formed by the college is conducting a probe and further action would be taken based on its outcome.

When contacted, Virudhunagar superintendent of police M Rajarajan said they have not received any complaint so far.

Vice-chancellor of MKU P P Chelladurai said, ""I suspect the entire episode was stage-managed by the college management as I formed a committee 25 days ago to investigate misappropriation of funds in the college. We are planning to file a complaint on Monday,"" he said."

Talking to TOI, Bhagwandas Ahire, principal KV-1 said, ""Based on written complaint submitted by parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of complaint, the committee had submitted report based on preliminary investigation, to deputy commissioner of KV who issued suspension of the teacher.""

He added that suspension was done on Wednesday evening with immediate effect and the teacher has been asked for temporary deputation at KV-2 till further orders. A high-level inquiry would now be conducted against teacher by the higher authorities of KV in Delhi.

The teacher was suspended after the claims made by parents and girls were found to be true in the initial probe.

Clarifying on not taking action upon complaint made by the students, the principal said that he had received an anonymous letter which could have been a mischief. Also, two days after the letter was received was holiday.

During the lectures, the teacher used to warn girls against wearing jeans and lipstick, saying, ""Girls expose their body only when they don't have beautiful faces. Girls have become so shameless, why did Nirbhaya go out so late at night with a boy who wasn't her husband? It's difficult to understand why an issue was made of this. Such incidents happen with girls in remote areas frequently. Nirbhaya's mother shouldn't have allowed her go out so late at night.""

In the alleged audio clip, she was heard saying ""Nirbhaya's mistake and not the boys"". ""Girls who face such incidents are cursed and it's a punishment for them,"" adding that when boys see girls ""doing it"" with one person they assume the girl would ""do it"" with others as well."

KV-1 principal Bhagwandas Ahire said biology teacher Snehlata Shankhwar was suspended and attached to another school on Wednesday evening after the complaint made by parents and girls against her was found to be true in initial investigation.

""Based on a written complaint by the parents, I formed an inquiry committee and personally monitored it. Within 24 hours of the complaint, the panel submitted its preliminary investigation report to the KV deputy commissioner, who issued suspension orders,"" Ahire said.

The teacher has been sent on temporary deputation to KV-2 till further orders. A high level inquiry will now be conducted against her by senior KV officials in Delhi, Ahire said.

Shankhwar had allegedly converted her class into cringe worthy sermon sessions, telling students that 'outgoing' girls are asking for rape. In an audio clip secretly recorded by one of the students, the teacher is heard 'warning' girls against wearing jeans and lipstick as it attracts Nirbhaya-like ordeal. She is heard saying that it was ""Nirbhaya's mistake and not the boys"".

""Girls have become so shameless, why did Nirbhaya go out so late at night with a boy who wasn't her husband? It's difficult to understand why an issue was made of this. Such incidents happen with girls in remote areas frequently. Nirbhaya's mother shouldn't have allowed her go out so late at night,"" she allegedly said.

She also allegedly told students that girls ""expose their body only when they don't have a beautiful face"".

Shankhwar's comments on Nirbhaya and girls' dress sense had triggered nationwide outrage. On January 29, parents had marched to the school and demanded action against her. When the news got out, she tried to defend her statement.

""What happened with Nirbhaya was wrong but she could have saved herself, if she had not gone out late,"" she told media persons."
