However, payment for the remaining months stopped since then and altogether five months salaries from July to November remains pending.

""During the past two to three years we received our salary almost regularly and when we heard about the priority of education in the state from the new government, we were very happy. But the situation has become worse than before. What has happened to the promised now?"" the teachers said.

The association said it was unfortunate that teachers have to beg every time to get their dues and questioned the possibility of imparting quality education if they are not given any importance.

The association added that despite financial constraints, they had rendered their services and conducted the annual examination including other school activities on their own expenses in the absence of any maintenance grant for the whole year. Taking all these into consideration, the teachers urged the government to release their pending dues before Christmas.

""Non-payment of salary on a regular basis always leads to extreme difficulties for us. Now with the onset of winter and the festive season approaching, we also have to think about our children's comfort and happiness,"" the association said."

Out of these 10 teachers, four are from Mansa and rest from Patiala, while six are on regular pay rolls.

Among them, Amolak Singh, leader of Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) union, who was posted in Sadda Singh Wala village, about 10 km from Mansa city, has been transferred to the last village of the district, Beerewala Dogra, 60 km away from his last posting. Hardeep Singh Sidhu, ETT union district president, said the ETT teachers cannot be transferred out of the district and hence the last village was chosen. ""Amolak is on regular rolls."" Narinder Singh, district president of government teachers' union, Mansa, was posted in Raipur village of the district. He was earlier in Tarn Taran district. Karamjeet Singh, a science teacher of Dalelwala village in Mansa, has been sent to Amritsar. He is a committee member of democratic teachers' front, Mansa, said Sidhu.

Senior vice-president of government teachers' union Gurdas Singh has been transferred to Hoshairpur from Bajewala village of Mansa. All the teachers had participated in the dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner's office in Mansa. Sidhu said as all the union leaders are active in the ongoing protest, they have been targeted. ""It is an effort to weaken out protest. However, so far no one has joined.""

Villagers also locked schools and staged protest outside them on Tuesday, demanding that the transfers of the four Mansa teachers be revoked. Though District Education Officer Subash Chandra tried to pacify the villagers by saying that teachers on deputation will be sent soon, they refused to relent, saying that the transfers were uncalled for.

On the other hand, Atinder Pal Singh Ghagga, president of DTF, Patiala, has been transferred to Hoshairpur, while Bikram Dev to Gurdaspur, Davinder Singh Poonia, convenor of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, said.

To avoid departmental action, protesting Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and jalandhar teachers have decided to take an extra hour of classes daily with only four months left for final exams.

Around 8,800 SSA and RMSA teachers have been protesting for the past three weeks across Punjab, with many of them sitting on fast unto death in Patiala.

""We are protesting only after the school timing.

Teachers are protesting at all the places where ministers, Congress MPs, MLAs or leaders go, besides in front of their houses, against their recent regularisation, as per which their initial pay scale will be around Rs 15,000 per month, against their present monthly income of Rs 42,800, along with a three-year probation. It is only after the probation that they will get their full salary.

Government had asked these teachers to either get regularised as per the government salary norms or stay with their previous employer (SSA/ RMSA). Around 1,800 teachers out of 8,800 have opted to become regular teachers with the Punjab government on this condition.

MHRD objected to appointment process 5 yrs ago: Teachers

As the previous SAD-BJP government in Punjab had appointed these teachers by creating SSA/ RMSA societies, the protesters said that they are already teaching in government schools on contract basis, but the latter is not accepting them as their contractual employees. They said that even the central government had advised the state five years back against their appointment through a letter dated March 4, 2013. The letter from Human Resources Development Department (MHRD) said, ""It is found that in Punjab, a separate SSA cadre of contractual teachers has been created, for whom different service arrangements have been spelt out and they are posted only in SSA schools. This is an erroneous phenomenon. All schools receiving SSA funding are schools of the state government, and so are all the teachers. SSA is only a programme providing additional funding to the state for elementary education development and reform."" The letters also say that the state is advised to kindly desist from creating any analogous situation on this account."

Dimapur, Sep. 5: Even as the teaching community all over the country are being honoured on the occasion of the 57th Teacher's Day on Wednesday, it was a sad day for 639 teachers serving in 146 government high schools who were recruited under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) in 2016. The teachers under the aegis of NRMSATA 2016 batch teachers hace been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 against an Office Memorandum (OM) which directed the teachers to accept a reduced pay.

The RMSA 2016 batch teachers have taken their discontentment in the form of agitation in Kohima-which would have coincided with Teacher's Day, if it was not called off by the Nagaland RMSA Teachers' Association (NRMSATA) as a mark of respect to the teachers'.

The NRMSATA 2016 had converged in Kohima on Sept. 4 from across the state for the agitation which was termed as unlawful by the administration.

""The association had sought permission from the district administration but was denied on the directives of the govt. on the claim that they had deposited the pending salary of the RMSA 2016 batch teachers"", said NRMSATA 2016 batch president Sao Venuh.

""However, unless our salaries are credited in our account, we will not accept their justification"", he said.

""Even after our permission for agitation was denied, the association went ahead with the peaceful sit-in putting in our energy on Sept. 4.

We came and voice out what we were supposed to do and made our points clear. The most crucial issue is for revocation of OM and the reason behind our agitation was for the govt. to revoke the OM which directs for deduction of salary"", affirmed Sao.

Venuh, speaking with Eastern Mirror through telephone on the eve of Teacher's Day, said it was unfortunate that the RMSA 2016 batch teachers had to resort to such means as the teachers are helpless and are compelled to do so, to send a message to the authorities, to demand for their rights.

'Respecting the auspicious day and we as teachers decided not to take our agitation on Sept. 5 but have sought permission to continue after Sept. 5 which the association was yet to be granted', communicated Venuh.

""As teachers we want to observe the day with our colleagues, along with the state teaching fraternity and the students' and we are also not contented that we have to miss an auspicious day.

But it was a crucial time for the teachers at this juncture to demand our rights"", lamented Venuh.

""It was the first time, since our appointment, that we are missing Teacher's Day. Although it does not make us happy, we have become an object of uncertainty with an uncertainty employment"", Venuh asserted."

The RMSATA-2016 has been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 after the government announced that the monthly salary of the teachers would be reduced by INR 6315.

""Why we can say with conviction that the OM is by nature irrational, invalid and discriminatory is because of the actual guidelines and official documents from the MHRD where this OM has its basis,"" the press release stated.

The association pointed out that in the original draft document of the new scheme stated that ""henceforth there will not be any separate SSA and RMSA teachers; salary as per the new scheme will thus be based only on the different sections of the school they teach viz. primary teachers-Rs 15,000, Upper Primary Teachers- Rs 20,000 and Secondary Teachers-Rs 25,000. We the RMSA 2016 Teachers fall under the category of secondary teachers with an amount of Rs 25,000.""

According to the statement given in the document, it said that all the SSA teachers who are predominantly engaged in teaching the primary and upper primary sections will be receiving only INR 15,000 and INR 20,000. However, it stated that the OM was not served to them.

""The memorandum of the dept. itself is also self contradictory as it states that they are following the guidelines of the new scheme fixing the salary of the RMSA at Rs 25,000, very ironically this OM is served only to some 2016 appointed RMSA Teachers, the other teachers of RMSA appointed in the year 2013 and on May 2016 are exempted from this OM."" it alleged

The association also pointed out the Project Approval Board minutes of the SSA, MHRD which stated; ""State should meet the balance amount from its own resources including the additional funds devolved under the 14th Finance Commission. As per Section 7(5) of the RTE Act, 2009, the State Government shall after taking into consideration the sum, provided by the Central Government and mandatory matching State share, provide the balance funds necessary to fulfill the estimate for the implementation of the Act.""

It asserted that when the state can meet the additional funds (funds apart from central and state matching share) of SSA and other RMSA teachers, it can in no way take the excuse of fund constrains of the state and discriminate a certain section of its employees who fall under the same scheme.

The Nagaland Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Association (NSSATA) of the 2010 and 2013 batches had claimed that the NSSATA (2010 and 2013 batches) were appointed as regular employees according to the nature of appointment.

A press statement appended by the president, Penthungo Y Yanthan, and general secretary, Vinoka Sohe of the NSSATA on Monday, stated that according to their appointment orders, the teachers were endowed with a pay scale and other allowances prescribed by the government of Nagaland from time to time with effect from the date of joining.

The association mentioned the RTI reply to Ponchulo Wanth; ""post creation as being a government of Nagaland undertaking and not of the SSA. ""Hence teachers are appointed on a regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.""

Therefore, the association said unlike other SSA and RMSA contractual and adhoc-fixed teachers, the SSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 batch, along with the RMSA 2013 batch are regular employees as per the advertisement and the nature of appointment.

The RMSA 2013 has also clarified the nature of RMSA teachers' appointment and as to why the 2013 batch along with SSA 2010 and 2013 batch were not brought under the purview of the OM.

It stated that they were appointed as regular employees by the government of Nagaland under the Directorate of School Education. It claimed that they enjoy a pay band with all other allowances and rates prescribed by the state government from time to time with effect from the date of joining and deduction towards NPS and GIS which is clearly written in our appointment order issued by the Directorate of School Education and not by the RMSA Mission.

Therefore, the association said that the office memorandum is not applicable to RMSA 2013 and SSA 2010 and 2013 batch."

The teachers are boycotting class protesting pending salary; they have not been paid for four months i.e., April-July, it was informed. The teachers are demanding redress for government regulations that are said to have been stipulated in an office memorandum issued by the government that the RMSA's subject teachers' salary would be a fixed pay of INR 25,000 per month from 2018-19.

The RMSA teachers started their agitation on August 27, boycotting classes in their demand to the government to release pending salary, and that they won't be accepting the new 'guidelines' issued by the government.

An office memorandum dated Aug. 17 2018 stated to be a ""notice to contractual subject teacher engaged by state mission office, RMSA Nagaland"" read that the ministry of Human Resource Development had integrated the erstwhile Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan into a single entity named the ""Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan"" from 2018-19 onward.

As a policy from the merger, it stated that the government of India had issued guidelines fixing the salary payable to RMSA subject teachers at INR 25,000 per month from 2018-19.

In this regard, the RMSA teachers were directed to submit their acceptance of the new salary scale prescribed by the Central government within a month's period from the notice being issued.

The memorandum was issued through Principal Secretary Menukhol John. It stated: ""This OM is issued in pursuance of the clause given for condition of salary as indicated in the engagement order along with the termination clause.""

The RMSA batch's President Sao Venuh talked to Eastern Mirror. Besides the 'non-release' of the salary, Venuh said, a new development had cropped up in regard to the OM that was served to the RMSA teachers. Despite its request to the department, the state had issued the notice seeking submission of the teachers' acceptance 'through signing of a bond' of the new salary prescribed by the Centre within a month's period from the date the notice was issued, Venuh said.

Terming the memorandum a ""severe and serious issue"" for the teachers, Venuh said that the ""OM has threatened the teachers to the extent of termination of our services."" In such a juncture, he said, they had no option but to go for agitations.

Asserting that the teachers shall not back off from the demand, Venuh maintained that they would rather intensify the agitation and challenge the government 'if they really care for the students' and its employees. He added that there had been no response from the government as yet in spite of the classes being boycotted for three days.

The teachers will intensify their agitation from next week in the form of a 'silent protest,' the updates said."

In a release issued by association president Sao Venuh and general secretary Haisoliabe Ndang, the association alleged that the State Government has been intimidating RMSA teachers of the 2016 batch.

According to the association, the office memorandum stated that reduction of salaries was a directive given by the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to merge Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and RMSA into the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SMSA) - an integrated scheme of school education.

The association pointed out that the SMSA draft document clearly states that the Central share under the scheme would be restricted as per the prevalent fund sharing pattern for primary teachers drawing salaries up to Rs 15,000 per month, upper primary teachers up to Rs 20,000 per month and secondary teachers up to Rs 25,000 per month. It said the draft document also states that the salary structure would be determined by the State norms for salaries.

Therefore, the association stated, the fixation of Rs 25,000 per month for secondary teachers did not indicate the actual salary, but simply the fund sharing pattern.

The association also claimed that as per the project approval board meeting minutes for Nagaland, a sum of Rs 10171.12 lakh was estimated for salaries of teachers according to the norms of the scheme and the balance amount was to be met by the State out of its own resources.

On recruitment of teachers, the draft document laid down that teachers would be recruited as per the terms and conditions of the States and Union territories.

As such, the association questioned what are the actual terms and conditions of Nagaland for recruitment and why there are different categories of teachers based on the nature of appointment when everyone has gone through the same mode of recruitment through a written examination and viva voce.

Based on this, the RMSA teachers have demanded equal treatment of all teachers under the new Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan and demanded that the Government should issue new appointment letters to all teachers irrespective of erstwhile schemes with the same terms and conditions."
