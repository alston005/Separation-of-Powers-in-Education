He told PTI that although in 1993, Delhi got a legislative assembly, 2018 saw ""another milestone"" in terms of governance and democracy.

Also, 2018 saw less of rabble-rousing between the AAP government and the Lt Governor's office as compared to the past after the July 4 Supreme Court order.

The apex court had ruled that the lieutenant governor of Delhi is bound by the ""aid and advice"" of the Delhi government. Earlier, both the AAP government and the LG had been on loggerhead over administrative issues.

""In 1993, Delhi got the power to elect government, but Delhi's democratically-elected government got full power to work in 2018 after the SC verdict.

""It was a major breakthrough to strengthen democracy... 2018 will be remembered as a 'landmark year' in the history of Delhi,"" Sisodia said.

2018 also saw passing of several ambitious projects of the AAP government, including doorstep delivery of ration, installation of CCTVs across the city among others.

However, the deputy chief minister rued that as services do not come under the Delhi government, the AAP dispensation cannot create new posts.

A two-judge bench of the Supreme Court reserved its order on services and other issues and an order in this regard can come anytime.

""As the Delhi government does not have power of services, we cannot create new posts. We can open news schools, but when it comes to hiring teachers, it will be done by the LG. We can open new hospitals, but hiring of doctors will be executed by the lieutenant governor,"" he said.

Sisodia hoped that in 2019, services will come under the Delhi government.

In 2019, the Aam Aadmi Party government plans to conclude its ongoing or pending projects such as free Wi-Fi, setting up of 1,000 mohalla clinics and doorstep delivery of ration among others.

Giving details about the government's upcoming projects, Sisodia said that the AAP dispensation will start entrepreneurship curriculum for students of class 9 to 12 for 2019, a move aimed at giving an opportunity to youths to become job providers instead of job seekers.

Also, the government will open teacher-training university and sports university in 2019, he said, adding that the process of executing these projects is in the final stage.

According to Sisodia, the proposed teachers' university is aimed at giving quality training to teachers. Sports university will offer various curriculum to youths, intended to encourage youths towards sports.

Another project which will be executed in 2019 is free Wi-Fi. The government is considering two-three modules to provide free-Wi-Fi, a pre-poll promise of the Aam Aadmi Party.

""We are currently considering two-three modules. The Delhi government is on it. Technologies with regard to Wi-Fi are getting changed day-by-day. I can say that in 2019, Delhi will get free Wi-Fi,"" Sisodia said.

Talking about AAP government's doorstep delivery of services, Sisodia said that as of now, 40 services, including driving licence, certificates of birth, death, income and marriage, are being provided to Delhiites at their doorstep.

""We will start providing a total of 100 government services by the end of current financial year,"" he said.

Looking back at 2018, the tussle between the AAP government and former chief secretary Anshu Prakash was a major issue.

In February, Prakash had alleged assault by some AAP legislators in front of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Sisodia at the CM's residence.

The incident triggered a political storm, with the BJP and the Congress seeking to attack the AAP which vehemently rejected Prakash's allegations.

Following the alleged assault, IAS and DANICS officers boycotted attending meetings with cabinet ministers, including the chief minister, to register their protest demanding an apology over the issue.

In June, Kejriwal, Sisodia and cabinet ministers Gopal Rai and Satyendar Jain staged a sit-in at the LG's office, demanding that the lieutenant governor direct IAS officers to end their ""strike"" and order action against those who had struck work for ""four months"".

The ministers had also demanded the LG's approval for the doorstep delivery of rations. Following the sit-in, Lt Governor Anil Baijal started working from home."

Referring to the adoption of a resolution on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by the Delhi Assembly, which witnessed confusion after an AAP MLA slipped in a line on withdrawing former PM Rajiv Gandhi's Bharat Ratna, BJP president Amit Shah Sunday said it was akin to ""rubbing salt"" on the victims' wounds.

""What happened in the Assembly, and later, was like rubbing salt on the wounds of the riot victims; it has exposed the double-faced character of the Aam Aadmi Party,"" Shah said, addressing booth-level workers and local leaders at IGI stadium on booth management and strategies to be adopted in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

On Friday, the Assembly had passed a resolution urging the Centre to withdraw the Bharat Ratna awarded to Rajiv, alleging that he justified the riots. But the party had later distanced itself from this, maintaining that the demand did not make it to the final resolution unanimously passed through voice vote.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia had later said it was merely a proposal from an individual MLA, and that the AAP does not support the proposal on taking back the country's highest civilian award from Rajiv. Speaker Ram Niwas Goel had said he had never allowed the tabling of the ""amendment"" to the original resolution circulated among the MLAs.

Speaking to more than 12,000 workers, Shah said Sikh victims had been denied justice for so many years because ""the perpetrators of the riots were also the protectors (of the accused)"". He said it was only after the BJP came to power that justice was assured through the formation of a special investigation team and providing compensation to families of victims.

Shah also appealed to booth-level workers to take forward the message that if they choose Narendra Modi as Prime Minister in the 2019 elections, it will be last nail in the coffin of the Congress's ""nepotism and casteism"".

He asked workers to visit residents with a copy of the AAP's manifesto, and tell them how the party has not fulfilled its promises of constructing new schools and hospitals and installing CCTV cameras. ""Where are the hospitals, schools, marshals in buses for women's security and CCTVs? The condition of mohalla clinics is such that filth and dogs have been found in many,"" he alleged.

Shah said the Modi government, on the other hand, had fulfilled all its promises for Delhi and that the BJP will give an account of its work to voters in the 2019 elections. ""It is unfortunate that the Arvind Kejriwal government did not allow implementation of the Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi, fearing Modi will gain popularity,"" he said.

State unit general secretary Ravindar Gupta said ""the BJP is a party of cadres"". ""If we are blowing the election bugle, it has to start with addressing cadres... We have started preparations for elections and the slogan is booth jeeto, chunao jeeto (win booths to win elections),"" he said."

On the controversial resolution in Delhi Assembly Shah said it was ""like rubbing salt on the wounds of the victims and AAP should be ashamed of itself."" The resolution, moved by an AAP MLA, was however not passed.

Shah asserted that the ""when the next BJP government at Centre will identify each and every infiltrator and throw them out of the country."" Shah chose to specifically target Rahul Gandhi and Kejriwal since Congress and AAP are the key rivals of BJP preparing to repeat the victory on all seven Lok Sabha seats of Delhi in 2019.

""The lies of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi outweigh all the lies spoken since independence in the country. The victims of the 1984 riots did not get the justice till now because the perpetrators of the riots were being protected. Modi government formed a SIT to ensure that the victims get justice and now the victims are getting justice and Congress leaders are getting punished. It has been proved that the riots were carried out under the watch of those in power at that time and the violence was carried out by Congress leaders,"" Shah stated.

AAP which is working hard with an ambition to snatch all seven LS seats from BJP was targeted over the promises it made in the 2015 assembly polls. ""The list of the promises of AAP has turned out to be the list of their failures. Those who moved as common man earlier now move in Z+ security and still continue to make false promises to people,"" Shah said hitting out at Kejriwal.

""Where are the 500 new schools and three new hospitals in every Lok Sabha constituency promised by Kejriwal? The youth are looking for free WiFi and are disappointed. The promise of deploying marshals in buses has also fallen flat and CCTVs are nowhere to be seen. The condition of water supply has deteriorated and 50% people are forced to drink foul-smelling water,"" Shah said.

Elaborating on the work done by the BJP led central government since 2014, claimed that Modi government has fulfilled all its promises and the BJP will go to the voters in 2019 with the account of the work done. ""It is unfortunate Kejriwal government did not allow the implementation of Ayushman Bharat scheme in Delhi due to fear that the scheme will make PM Narendra Modi more popular. Where will the poor of Delhi go?"" he asked.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari stated that BJP will win all seven LS seats in Delhi and sang a song to motivate party workers to make Narendra Modi PM again.

On Rafael deal, Shah hit out at Rahul Gandhi and stated that despite Supreme Court verdict on Rafale deal, Rahul Gandhi is still ""lying over the deal and is levelling false allegations.""

""Congress and its allies created uproar after 40 lakh infiltrators were identified in Assam. Congress is worried for infiltrators, but they are not worried when infiltrators carry out bomb blasts and our citizens are killed,"" Shah stated.

""The 2019 election will mark an end to the politics of casteism, dynastic politics, and the politics of appeasement and the victory of BJP will end it all,"" he said.

As part of its strategy for 2019 polls, BJP will form a chain of WhatsApp groups to link booth level workers with national leadership to strengthen the communication channels. Shah advised workers to meet each and every voter of Delhi and convince them to vote for BJP. The booth in-charges have been asked to study the causes of defeat in previous years and address them. Ahead of 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP plans to hold conventions of booth presidents in different parts of the country. It began with the meet in Delhi."

With the academic session ending in less than three months, students in South Corporation schools are yet to receive money for stationery, none of the schools have women security guards, and only 62 out of 344 school buildings have CCTV cameras installed.

The South Delhi Municipal Corporation had issued a press statement in June, saying it would install 4,348 CCTV cameras in 344 primary schools within four months. More than 5,000 students in 14 schools are forced to sit on floors, as there no desks and benches, and 44 schools do not have Jal Board water connections.

These details emerged during the SDMC House meeting on Monday, in response to questions asked by the Leader of Opposition, AAP's Praveen Kumar.

Kumar, the councillor from Sitapur, said: ""The (BJP) made tall promises of deploying women marshalls and CCTVs, but in several schools, teachers open gates as there are no security guards at all."" South Corporation Education committee chairperson Nandini Sharma said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

Sharma added: ""We recieved Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as subsidy for uniforms."" To which, Kumar said: ""Desks and benches will wear out every year. Preparations should have been done in advance."""
