Ganta Srinivas Rao, Andhra Pradesh Human Resources Development Minister, has mandated all the universities' Vice Chancellors to arrange meetings every three months to address the academic and administrative issues pending with them, as reported by Hans India.

Rao demanded that the officials fill all vacancies speedily to compete with private universities. Most importantly he directed that the biometric system should be introduced to monitor student and staff attendance regularly. He also said that placement cells in all universities will be opened soon.

Biometric attendance was only being followed by those colleges affiliated to JNTU-H, and not by colleges affiliated to Osmania University and Kakatiya University said the Telangana Engineering College Management Association.

Mr Sharan Raichur, President of Telangana Joint Action Committee, alleged that the attendance system was deliberately not being implemented by colleges so that they could collect attendance fees later on. He also conceded that the students were not interested in the classes because of the faulty faculty as reported by Deccan Chronicle.

Association president Mr Goutham Rao reiterated that there should be a uniform policy and all universities should implement the biometric system."

This time Congress president Rahul Gandhi is being targeted on social media for a viral photo which shows TS Singh Deo, a cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh. In the viral photo, Deo, who is much older to Gandhi, is seen bowing to touch his feet.

A Facebook page, 'India against Presstitudes', posted this photograph with a message: ""48-year-old senior blessing his 80-year-old junior. My friend Pappu ji is kind"".

Thousands of people shared this post and hundreds commented on it, attacking Rahul and the Congress culture. Many people even doubted if the picture was photoshopped.

India Today's Fact Check team found that the photograph is real. Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo did indeed bow in front of Rahul.

Other Facebook pages like 'Social Tamasha', 'I support Modi Ji and BJP' also carried this picture with various captions hitting out at the Congress president.

In the photograph, one can see a grey-haired man bowing in front of Rahul. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also standing beside Rahul with a bouquet in hand on the red carpet. Senior Congress leader RPN Singh can also be seen in the crowd.

India Today TV spoke to TS Singh Deo to check the claims made on social media regarding the photograph. He confirmed that this is the venue of the swearing-in ceremony on December 17 and he was present there when Rahul Gandhi arrived. However he did not try to touch Rahul's feet and only shook hands. According to him, the photo is morphed.

But at the same time, Deo himself admitted that he has a habit of taking the blessings of senior party leaders by touching their feet on special occasions irrespective of their age.

""On that day too, I touched feet of the guests sitting on the dais after the oath taking,"" said Singh Deo. ""Just after my taking oath as a minister, I even tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the dais but he stopped me from doing it,"" he added.

Singh Deo indeed touched the feet of the guests on the dais and Rahul Gandhi stopped him; this can be seen in this video.

We could not find any supporting video which would have clearly established the sequence of events captured in the viral photo. But we could also not find any evidence to support the claim of Deo that the picture is morphed.

Moreover, when we pressed upon Deo to describe clearly what had happened at that moment, he gave self-contradictory statements. He even talked about picking up a napkin lying on the floor. But no such napkin is visible in the photo.

Looking closely at the photo, we observed that the shadows were aligned perfectly with the characters, hinting that the image is real.

Rajasthan Patrika, a local newspaper, also carried this viral photo claiming that the minister was actually trying to pick up a thread hanging loosely on the floor from the bouquet in Manmohan Singh's hands. But it can be seen that the thread hanging from the bouquet is nowhere close to the floor. Moreover, Singh Deo is bowing in front of Rahul Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh who is standing few steps away.

We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh, who was also present with Rahul. He confirmed that Singh Deo tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.

A viral photo on social media claims that senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo fell at the feet of Congress President Rahul Gandhi soon after taking oath as a cabinet minister in the newly-formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh.

In the picture, Singh Deo is seen bending near Gandhi's feet as Manmohan Singh and other leaders look on.

The photo has gone viral on several Facebook pages related to the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, with the message ""48 साल का युवा 78 साल के बुजुर्ग को आशीर्वाद देते हुए""

The photo was also shared by several other pages like Post Card Fans, My Prime Minister Modi, Social Tamasha and I Support Modi Ji and BJP.

TRUE OR FALSE?

Well, the claim is false on two points. Firstly, he is not 78 years old, as claimed in the message accompanying the photo. Born in 1952, Singh Deo is currently 67 years old, as recorded in the affidavit filed by him for the state Assembly elections.

Secondly, while the photo certainly seems as though the senior leader was falling at the Congress scion's feet, it apparently was not so.

A senior journalist based out of Raipur, who incidentally was at the oath-talking ceremony, confirmed to The Quint that Singh Deo had not bent down to touch Gandhi's feet. In fact, the story is quite different.

""I was there when this particular incident happened, Singh Deo had bent down not to touch Gandhi's feet, but to pick up a piece of thread that had fallen off the bouquet that Manmohan Singh was carrying. He definitely did not fall at Gandhi's feet.""Senior journalist to The Quint

Rajasthan Patrika, too, carried the viral photo with a small caption explaining the incident.

The daily had also zoomed into the photo to show the piece of thread that had fallen near Gandhi's feet.

BHUPESH BAGHEL SWORN IN AS CM

The new cabinet in Chhattisgarh was sworn in on Monday, 17 December, with Bhupesh Bagehl taking the mantle as chief minister. Senior leaders Tamradhwaj Sahu and TS Singh Deo were sworn in as ministers.

The party has not appointed any deputy chief minister for the state.

The Congress won a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh, bagging 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with only 15 seats, and Mayawati-Ajit Jogi's JCC+ alliance managed to win in 7 constituencies.

Singh Deo is likely to get the key portfolio of Finance and and Tamradhwaj Sahu either Agriculture or Public Works. The allocation of portfolios in the Bhupesh Baghel Cabinet is expected to be completed by December 24, Congress sources say.

Mr. Baghel is expected to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi soon to discuss the allocation, said a Congress leader, who did not wish to be identified. Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been in the reckoning for the top job in the State, were sworn in along with Mr. Baghel on Monday.

A day after pictures of the beaming trio holding hands with Mr. Gandhi were broadcast from Raipur, the jockeying for the meaty assignments has begun.

According to party officials, Mr. Deo had made it clear that having missed out on the top post, he should be given the Finance portfolio, which would enable him to influence key policies. The former Leader of the Opposition is considered the brain behind the party's manifesto, or Jan Ghoshna Patra, which promised a farm loan waiver and a minimum support price of ₹2,500 a quintal for paddy.

Mr. Sahu, who belongs to the dominant Sahu community, an OBC caste, could get either Agriculture or the Public Works portfolio, a party leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been seen by some as a favourite of the party's leaders in Delhi, lost out after Mr. Baghel, Mr. Deo and former Chattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Charan Das Mahant all opposed his candidature, party leaders said. A miffed Mr. Sahu had walked out of the meeting before being placated by the party leadership, the sources said. The idea of having Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu share the top job, with each occupying the post for two-and-a-half years, was also briefly considered before being dropped as many felt that it would send out a wrong message, especially after the Congress had won such a decisive mandate.

Within hours of taking the reins on Monday, the Congress government cleared a waiver of farm loans amounting to ₹6,100 crore which would help over 16 lakh farmers. It also announced the promised support price for paddy and a decision to set up a special investigation team to probe the Maoist ambush of 2013 in the Jiram Valley, in which the party's top leaders in the State were all killed."

After four days of protracted deliberations and brainstorming, Congress president Rahul Gandhi finally took the decision on who the chief minister should be. The announcement was made in Raipur on Sunday afternoon.

Baghel's rise in state politics began almost five years ago, after the top leadership of the Chhattisgarh Congress was wiped out in a Maoist attack at Jhiram Ghati in Bastar on 25 May, 2013.

The Ajit Jogi-led Congress had lost to the BJP in the 2003 Assembly election. Thereafter, the party also lost the elections in 2008 and 2013, which weakened the organisation deeply.

Baghel's first challenge after taking over as Chhattisgarh Congress chief four years ago was to consolidate the faction-ridden party and strengthen it at the grassroots level. It was certainly a tough task, especially when the BJP had been wielding immense power at the Centre and in the state.

After the election results were announced on 11 December, Rahul sought a referendum through an app called 'Shakti' - a unique experiment of sorts in Chhattisgarh. Nearly two lakh party workers, including the newly-elected legislators, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate.

According to sources, Singh Deo was earlier ahead of Baghel in the race for the post of chief minister. However, after a meeting of the Congress' top leadership in Delhi, followed by a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party, the party zeroed in on Baghel's name.

Factors in favour of Baghel

Baghel, the 57-year-old MLA from Patan, was deputy leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. He belongs to the Kurmi caste, which is considered a backward one. He has served as a minister in both the Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. After he became president of Chhattisgarh Congress in October 2014, he toured the state on foot and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

Even when he was a minister in the Ajit Jogi government, he had been a strong critic of Jogi, and the two never got along well. After Jogi quit the Congress and became its most bitter critic, the party leadership wanted someone to take both Jogi and the ruling Raman Singh government head on. Baghel was believed to be the right choice.

Baghel is known for his aggressive style of leadership, which has also attracted criticism from a section of party workers. However, this warrior-like image helped him to take the party to victory. The Congress got a landslide victory by winning 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, while the BJP got only 15 seats.

Baghel had been in jail for 14 days on charges of circulating a ""sex CD"" involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government. The BJP claimed that the CD was a fabricated one. However, the issue boomeranged against the saffron party, as the jail term became a factor in favour of Baghel.

While Baghel has been a minister, he also has age on his side. He is younger than Singh Deo and another contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu.

""Baghel's strong anti-establishment image, and his agitations over agrarian issues and rural distress, acted in his favour. He has been vocal against the RSS-BJP combine and has exposed corruption in the Raman Singh government. With strong secular credentials, he led the Congress' fight against the BJP,"" Ruchir Garg, a former senior journalist who joined Chhattisgarh Congress before the polls, told Firstpost.

Garg added, ""As he has strong organisational skills, he consolidated the Congress in Chhattisgarh and acted against anti-party people.""

However, the role of TS Singh Deo in the Congress' performance cannot be undermined. The party's manifesto, considered unique among such documents presented by the party in other states, played a pivotal role in the party's landslide victory.

Singh Deo, 66, popularly known as 'TS Baba"" across the state, was the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, and represents Ambikapur.

According to party sources, Rahul hailed the manifesto as a unique experiment and asked his research and analytics team to study and replicate it for the 2019 general election.

""Prior to the drafting of the manifesto, party leaders went to the masses and understood their hopes and aspirations, before coming out with a list of the ""doable"" promises in their manifesto. This ensured that no section of the society was left uncared for. It also ensured that the chances of the party defaulting on its promises were less,"" Chhattisgarh-based political commentator Parivesh Mishra said.

""Often, the drafting of a party manifesto is given low priority, and is done behind closed doors. Many promises are left unfulfilled. However, the Congress' Vachan Patra this time had short and long-term goals, with deadlines,"" he added.

The third contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu (69), the only Lok Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh, is known as Rahul's Man Friday. However, after the result of the survey of the ""Shakti"" app came out, his name was all but ruled out as a chief minsiterial candidate. According to political analysts, Sahu's candidature for the chief minister's post came up quite late.

In a letter submitted to the district education officer (DEO), Hyderabad, the management stated that the revision has been rolled out keeping with government orders that stipulate schools to adhere by a fixed structure for fee, teachers' salaries and other expenses. Accordingly, the school that was charging kindergarten students ?1.22 lakh per year, will now charge ?57,100 per child. For students in Classes 1 to 4, the revised fee is ?61,600 while for those in Classes 5 to 7 it is ?66,000 per year.

""While we received complaints against four schools, this particular school was found violating norms mentioned in GO Ms No. 1. As per the order, a school should spend at least 50% of the fee on teachers' salaries and 15% on maintenance. However, in this case, the school was spending less than 50% of the fee on teachers and were found allocating more for maintenance,"" said B Venkata Narasamma, DEO, Hyderabad. She said that these discrepancies came to the fore during an enquiry conducted on DPS, Mahendra Hills.

Among other illegalities, the school was also found fleecing students who did not opt for extra-curricular activities. ""If a school is providing activities like swimming, dancing or sports, it cannot add that amount to the fee of all students. The fee should be different for those signing up for them and those who aren't,"" Narasamma added.

Apart from being pulled up by the DEO, the school management also had a case filed against them by activist Vijay Gopal who dragged several schools to the court for charging exorbitant fees.

Speaking about the recent revision, Gopal said: ""Now that the school has accepted its fault, as per rules mentioned in the education act, the management must face a minimum punishment of three years in jail. Also, they must be forced to return the excess fee, to parents, collected over the last decade or so.""

He maintained that the ongoing case will not be dropped just because the school has slashed the fee.

""Once the management of this particular school is awarded jail term, all the other erring schools will fall in line,"" Gopal said, adding, ""if the verdict in the lower court is in favour of the school, I will approach the high court to get justice."""

The Congress has not come up with a clear choice yet, even after the referendum party chief Rahul Gandhi had sought on Wednesday through an app called 'Shakti'. A unique experiment of sorts, more than three lakh party workers, including elected Congress candidates, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate for Chhattisgarh.

After hectic parleys at Hotel Babylon in state capital Raipur on Wednesday, two names emerged on the basis of the referendum through 'Shakti' and a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party in the presence of central observer and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge. According to party sources, between former Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly TS Singh Deo and Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, the former is the front-runner for the chief minister's post at present. However, the party hasn't announced the name and is waiting for Rahul to take the final call.

""At our end, we conveyed our decision regarding the chief ministerial candidate. Unlike Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we don't have a national-level leader for the post, so there's no debate over selection. Now the final decision will be made in Delhi by the party president,"" a Chhattisgarh Congress party source told Firstpost.

File photo of Congress leader TS Singh Deo.

Similar to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the supporters of the two contenders for the office of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh have now got into clashes over the issue of ""Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri"" (who will be the chief minister).

Outside Baghel's house in Raipur, the Chhattisgarh Congress chief's supporters got into a brawl with Deo's backers on Thursday. Even in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia gathered at Indira Bhawan -- the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters -- with large cut-outs and posters, shouting slogans in Scindia's favour and demanding his appointment as the chief minister.

Chhattisgarh is the only state among the three that the Congress won where Rahul used the 'Shakti' app to know party workers' choice of chief minister. Project Shakti is an internal digital platform of the party that aims to link all Congress workers countrywide with party president.

So finally, who is likely to be the Chhattisgarh chief minister? Let's look at the choices.

Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, popularly known as ""TS Baba"" across the state, is the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, representing the Ambikapur constituency. A scion of the famous Surguja princely state and son of former chief secretary of undivided Madhya Pradesh MS Singh Deo, the 66-year-old exercises strong influence and popularity in Surguja, which attests to the fact that of the eight Assembly seats in the district, the Congress had won seven in the last election.

Pros: TS Singh Deo is suave and articulate. According to sources, most Chhattisgarh Congress party workers favoured his candidature over Baghel's in both the Shakti referendum and at the Congress Legislative Party meeting. Deo was also the brain behind the Chhattisgarh Congress manifesto, which was considered unique among the five manifestos the party released ahead of the Assembly elections.

""During the making of this manifesto, TS Singh Deo extended his reach to beyond Congress workers. He met every section of the society across the state, discussed issues with them, took their feedback and incorporated them in the manifesto. This exercise helped him get connected with as many voters as possible in Chhattisgarh and made him popular simultaneously. This manifesto, which has been hailed as a unique experiment by Rahul Gandhi, proved to be a game-changer in this election,"" political commentator Parivesh Mishra told Firstpost.

Con: His business ties with a big business house can prove to be a handicap, as some party workers pointed out. ""There can be conflict of interest with our party line,"" an elected member said on condition of anonymity.

Bhupesh Baghel, an MLA from Patan, was the deputy Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly. A backward-class leader (Kurmi), the 57-year-old has served as minister in both Digvijaya Singh and Ajit Jogi's cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Active in social reform works, Baghel toured Chhattisgarh on foot before the elections and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

File photo of Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel. PTI

Pros: Baghel virtually revived the party and gave shape to a new Congress after becoming Pradesh Congress Committee chief five years ago. He has strong organisational skills and is a more grassroots party worker in comparison. He actively campaigned across Chhattisgarh this election.

Con: According to insiders, Baghel's leadership style is not acceptable to many workers in the faction-ridden party in the state. His name had emerged in the alleged case of sleaze CDs involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government ahead of the election. A special CBI court had sent him to 14-day judicial custody in the case.

Two other leaders, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charandas Mahant, who were earlier in the fray for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's chair, are now apparently out of the race.

A 66-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Durg and a leader of the Sahu community, which has a sizeable presence in Chhattisgarh among Other Backward Classes, Sahu is now a fence-sitter. ""In case the Congress top leadership disagrees on Deo and Baghel, Sahu may become the chief minister. But the chances are bleak,"" a party leader said.

While finalising the candidate for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's post, the party leadership also has to consider who can play a pivotal role in maximising the party's tally in Chhattisgarh and mobilise resources in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Besides, the party also has to fulfil the promises it made to voters in the state ahead of the polls.

Although it was initially believed that selecting the Chhattisgarh chief minister would be a comparatively easy task for the Congress, unlike in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, it seems that it's going to be another tight-rope walk for Rahul.

This clearly was a vote for the Congress. BJP has been routed because the Congress presented a very acceptable and clear option. The people of Chhattisgarh did not give a negative vote against any party.

Mankind has not only reached the moon and we have gone even beyond. And we have only made practical promises. We are looking at roughly a budget of Rs 1 lakh crore. We will obviously have to look at ways to generate additional revenue, cut expenses and prioritise. It is difficult but doable and will be done.

Obviously, Narendra Modi's magic didn't work, they did not even cross 20 seats. And Raman Singh, nice guy, a smiling face. He had been in power for 15 years and in all these years nothing really stuck to him. There were talks but still nothing stuck to him. But his own victory margin came down. Obviously, they were on a back foot. But such a massive victory, not only in terms of number of MLAs but in amount of vote share shows that it is the people's victory. And that our (Congress) president Rahul Gandhi managed to connect to the people.

In every election in the State the margin between Congress and BJP has never gone above 2 per cent. But at the same time, in Lok Sabha elections, which are usually held 4-6 months after the State Assembly polls, the margin widens. So obviously whichever party wins the State also impacts the Lok Sabha outcome too.

And more importantly, a chain has been formed in the Hindi heartland. Out of 65 seats in three States (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan) Congress only had five seats here. Even if we were to hand over half of the 65 seats to BJP it will no longer be in majority in the Lok Sabha."

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the poll politics of Chhattisgarh, which has always been dominated by the BJP and the Congress.

Several exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the big two.

Of the 90 Assembly segments, 51 are for the general category while 10 segments are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes.

In the last Assembly polls, the BJP had won 49, the Congress won 39, while one seat each was bagged by the BSP and an Independent.

The latest figures of the vote share released by the Election Commission of India shows that the Congress is leading with 43.8 percent vote share, while the BJP is trailing at 31.8 percent.

BJP ministers are trailing in the race as veteran BJP leader and sitting home minister Ramsewak Paikra is trailing by 500 votes, Cabinet minister Brijmohan Agarwal is trailing by 3800 votes, PWD Minister Rajesh Munat is trailing by 3300 votes after the second round of counting.

Former chief minister Ajit Jogi and leader of JCC party, the third front in Chhattisgarh said he is happy with the vote share as per early trends.

He said, ""We are satisfied with the number of seats we have won so far. We won what we did after campaigning for only two months. We are glad we were able to change the two-party system in Chhattisgarh. People wanted a change in Chhattisgarh and wanted to remove the BJP. They saw the Congress as being able to do this.""

Chief Minister Raman Singh has defied the initial scare after the first round of counting, he is now leading by 147 votes over Karuna Shukla in Rajnandgaon.

According to CEO Chhattisgarh, the Congress has claimed 41.56 percent vote share and BJP 27.82 percent vote share until 10.00 am. 26 percent vote share is claimed by independents and the JCC so far while 2 percent votes have gone to NOTA. This shows a significant shift in favour of the Congress from the last assembly polls when it trailed the BJP by 0.75 percent in vote share.

BJP is trailing behind with 21 seats as Congress inches closer to cosolidatibng its victory in Chhattisgarh by securing 51 seats till now. Trends show that Congress is leading in the state with 46 seats so far, the BJP is at 20 seats.

According to the early trends, former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's niece Karuna Shukla is leading in Chief Minister Raman Singh's constituency, while the three-term chief minister is trailing. Early trends also show that Ajit Jogi's son Amit is leading in the Marwahi constituency in Bilaspur district. However, reports say that the Congress is leading by a tight margin in the state.

Counting begins in Chhattisgarh and four other states. Early trends show BJP leading in sixteen seats, Congress in six.

State Election Commission has made extensive preparations for counting of votes for 90 assembly constituencies across Chhattisgarh. Section 128 and 144 has been imposed around counting centres to maintain order. Extensive measures have been taken to ensure peaceful counting.

Counting of votes will be conducted on Tuesday for the Chhattisgarh Assembly election, which is being viewed as a prestige battle for three-term chief minister Raman Singh and the Opposition Congress' fight for resurgence.

While the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is seeking a fourth straight term in office, the Congress is aiming to stage a comeback after being out of power for 15 years.

Tight security arrangements have been made at the counting centres in all 27 districts, particularly the Naxal-affected ones. Voting was held in two phases on 12 and 20 November to elect a new 90-member Assembly.

The state had recorded a 76.6 percent voter turnout in the polls.

""Counting for all 90 seats would start at 8 am at the 27 district headquarters. All preparations have been completed and a three-layer security has been arranged at each counting centre,""an election official told PTI.

The counting of postal ballots will begin at 8 am and half-an-hour after the postal ballots are counted, the process of counting votes from the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) begins, he said.

As many as 5,184 counting personnel and 1,500 micro-observers have been appointed for smooth conduct of the process, he said.

In every counting hall, 14 tables will be arranged in rows of seven tables each, apart from separate tables for the returning officer and for counting of postal ballots, he said.

The fate of 1,079 contestants, including Singh, his 11 ministers and state presidents of the BJP and the Congress will be decided on Tuesday. The chief minister was locked in a fight in Rajnandgaon seat against Congress' Karuna Shukla, the niece of former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the poll politics of Chhattisgarh, which has always been dominated by the BJP and the Congress.

Several exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the big two.

Of the 90 Assembly segments, 51 are for the general category while 10 segments are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes.

In the last Assembly polls, the BJP had won 49, the Congress won 39, while one seat each was bagged by the BSP and an Independent.

Edited excerpts:

How do see the 2018 assembly elections? Can your party form the next government?

We are wining this election. Sometimes there is a sense of undercurrent -- where there is a movement towards you -- but I am seeing a wave. There is a great sense of dissatisfaction that has transformed into wave to remove BJP.

Former Congress CM Ajit Jogi has formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and now contesting in an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party. What impact will he make?

Jogi was given a golden opportunity by Sonia [Gandhi] ji and the Congress leadership. He had only two MLAs with him when the state was formed. Jogi was seen as a capable person to rule the state, but he lost his chance. He wanted to create his own team, resulting in groupism. This led to the Congress losing the election. We are happy that Jogi is not with the Congress because he was sabotaging the party and helping the BJP.

Do you think Jogi can go with the BJP?

He is with the BJP; he is working for the BJP. But the Congress is getting a clear majority this time.

Who will be the CM if the Congress wins Chhattisgarh?

We have many faces. Two months ago, we met Rahul [Gandhi] ji along with other senior Congress leaders where it was decided that we will fight this election without any face. In Uttar Pradesh, BJP had not projected anyone and bagged 80% seats.

What will be Congress strategy in case we get a hung assembly?

We will certainly not join hands with Ajit Jogi. We will go back to people. If we can't fight an election with him, how can we form a government? We have responsibility towards people ...Coming back is power is not the sole criteria.

It is said that even after being in power for 15 years, Raman Singh is seen a reliable and trusted face. Do you agree?

It may have been so in 2008 but not now because Raman Singh did not fulfil his poll promises. His schemes are not working, electricity situation is bad, and all this has affected his image.

What about the infighting in the state unit of the Congress?

I don't think there is infighting in the Congress in Chhattisgarh. Nobody talks about the infighting in the BJP. Isn't there a fight between Raman Singh and [agriculture minister] Brijmohan Agarwal? Everyone knows who leaked documents showing Agarwal in bad light. And documents regarding scams by Raman Singh are also being leaked. Who is doing it in the BJP?"

MLA from Ambikapur constituency since 2008, Deo is touted as one of the frontrunners to be the chief ministerial picks if Congress comes to power. In a detailed conversation with Parth MN, Deo spoke about the need to improve the standard of living of tribals. He criticised the Raman Singh government for prioritising corporate interests over tribals, alleging that the BJP-led government has neglected their interests, which has resulted in an economic mismatch in Chhattisgarh. Popularly known as TS Baba, Deo, who belongs to the royal family, condemned the arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, who has lived in Chhattisgarh almost all her life.

Edited excerpts from the interview

If the Congress comes to power in Chhattisgarh, what would be your policy regarding the tribals, who form a major population of the state?

Tribals form about 31 percent of the population in Chhattisgarh. Their population has reduced by 1 percent in the last census. They live mostly in jungle areas, which is less productive as far as the agriculture is concerned. So the main concern for their development is to provide them with means of livelihood other than agriculture.

Which would be?

Their natural habitat is the forest. So, one could be forest produce, two could be tourism, third could be handicrafts, fourth could be their rights in mining areas which they have been denied, and government jobs. The idea is to provide a better standard of living. If you make a road, it is of no consequence unless it improves your standard of living. If you make a school, it is of no use unless it improves the standard of living. It's important for them to make the best of the environment they live in. If you are bringing in industry and it is not providing jobs to them, if you are doing mining activity and they don't have any share of it, it is of no consequence. For example, in Kondagaon, they told me there are around 70,000-80,000 people engaged in cottage industry where they make gun metal statues. I met the workers during the process of making the people's manifesto. And one could see very easily where they are falling behind. There are middlemen who help the tribal with the raw material, and for their profit margins to be higher, they sell the finished good at a price lower than the market price. The tribals complained regarding the handicraft corporation which has been formed. There, too, it is a matter of commission mongering. There is a large market for such products, which are of interest and value to the people within the country and even to export markets. Unfortunately, no government has thought of pushing them in a big way.

You said tribal population has decreased by one percent. What is the reason?

The survey was not done in 100 villages, so it could mean that 500 people in a village on an average, which is 50,000. It is not a small number. Several groups are migrating because of pressure from the Naxals and lack of employment in the state, among other things. Other reason could also be the rise in the number of people coming from outside the state. Reasons behind falling percent in the number of tribals in the state are mostly migration out of tribal areas and migration into Chhattisgarh. There is no proof to conclude that drop in birth rate is the reason.

What are the policies of the Raman Singh government regarding the tribals which you particularly object to?

It is basically neglect. There is a sense of complacency in the current government -- no matter what happens, we win. There is a lot of bureaucracy in the ruling government and Raman Singh is completely dependent on that. So long as they are delivering him a government, election after election, Raman Singh has left Chhattisgarh to be managed by the bureaucrats.

Has the tribal situation worsened in the past 15 years?

Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of BPL families in the country. At least, 39.93 percent is the reserve bank figure for average BPL families - urban and rural combined - for Chhattisgarh. It is the highest in the country. For a state that is supposed to be developing, something is going wrong. If the per capita income has crossed 90,000 and your family is an average of 4.53. By that calculation a family in Chhattisgarh should earn 4.5 lakh rupees. Tribals aren't earning even close to it. It basically indicates that a few people are earning a lot and the tribals are marginalised. If you are able to project the per capita is increasing, where is the money going?

Tribals are angry with Raman Singh for opening up their forests to the private players. How do you plan to manage them if you come to power?

Whether they are tribals or non-tribals, so long as they are residents of Chhattisgarh, you should target those reserves that displace the least. Secondly, if you are saying that in the next coming years, you are going to change the technology to non-traditional means of production of electricity, that is non-coal based electricity, you are not going to need coal. If you don't need all of this coal, where does it reside? If this coal resides in tribal areas only, then you don't have an option. But if there is coal in non-tribal areas, where the land could be more expensive, then the government is duty bound not to help the industry by getting cheaper land, which is forest and tribal land, in comparison to the land that may be more expensive but lie in non-tribal areas.

How do you plan to correct that?

Don't allot it to them.

Would it be as easy?

Yes, if you have the will. Lemru is an area between Surguja and Korba. It is a forest area of 450 square kilometers. This government had itself projected it as an elephant reserve. The UPA government had approved it. After the approval, Raman Singh government stalled it because they wanted to give it for mining. In our manifesto, we have included that areas like Lemru would be de-reserved for coal block allocation.

When I met the youth in tribal areas, they weren't exactly averse to industries. But they didn't trust the state and corporations coming in and working in their areas. They didn't trust them to provide adequate rehabilitation and compensation policies.

The section of society that is most opposed to land being taken over are the women. They are most opposed to being uprooted. Because, socially, they are the most affected and they are also the most exploited lot -- their lifestyle changes completely. They feel alientated. Then you have the male members, who go by how much will they get and what will they get. Then there is the youth -- after studying and switching over to wearing jeans, how many would like to till the land? They are looking for a different way of life. It is influenced by what they see on TV, or when they go to cities.

Social media has played a role in it?

Yes. The youth is not averse to land being taken. Yet, the rights of the landowners should have priority. The new land acquisition act requires 70-80 percent of the landowners.

But the biggest gripe of tribals is that the Forest Rights Act is not enforced and the consent is often ignored or forged.

We change that by governing better.

After having endured exploitation, there are several people who feel no matter who comes to power, the bureaucracy remains by and large the same.

We would like to believe that we are the kind of team that changes that.

There is an argument that the adivasis are torn between Naxals and police. How do plan to combat it?

When people use force to get power, then people will be seen standing behind whoever is in power and dominant. Historically, entire population never rebels. Eventually, the tendency is to accept whoever is stronger. In the Naxal area, whoever is seen to be stronger, will be able to subdue the population. The question is do people want to be with the Naxals or do they stand with the State? They would just want to be free. They do not like any pressure from anybody in their day to day lives. Basic nature of a tribal is independence. Among the adivasis, discontent begins when they are falsely accused of being Naxals, jailed for three-four years and then let off over lack of evidence.

Secondly, if Naxals or other organisations, that have the means to be dominant in that area, and are able to have their presence felt, why would people be listening to them? Either it is genuine support, where people feel the Constitution is a piece of paper worth nothing. I don't think that's what the people of Chhattisgarh think. Those villagers, who aren't fully educated, don't understand the matters of state or Constitution. It is a matter of making your dominance in an area through the ideology that you purport to believe in, using force to create dominance, and using people either as supporters - genuine or under pressure - or because you want to use them as shields. The informer is the target number one, not the exploiter. Had the exploiter been the target, we would have felt they are ideologically inclined.

You mentioned how the people are jailed and then let off for no proof. Sudha Bharadwaj has lived almost all her life in Chhattisgarh. She is in jail. What do you have to say about her arrest?

I have met her on a number of occasions. And she is a committed lady. Committed to the cause of those in need. She has given up better options in her career. The government does not have proof, and it is just trying to create pressure because somebody doesn't agree with what they are saying. No state organisation can make false charges against people to make their ends meet. She is an honest woman of high morale and ethical values. These are the people we need. If she has Maoist links, bring them out. What are you waiting for?

New Delhi: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo Friday said he strongly opposed criminal defamation and that nobody should be arrested on the basis of what they think.

Deo's comments on free speech come in the backdrop of the arrest of Right-leaning defence analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra over a joke by the BJD-led Odisha government.

Speaking about the right to free speech, he said, ""The government has no right to tell us what we should eat, wear or how we should behave in our bedrooms.""

Deo was in conversation with ThePrint's National and Strategic Affairs Editor Jyoti Malhotra at the twelfth edition of Democracy Wall.

Democracy Wall is a monthly free speech campus initiative organised by ThePrint in collaboration with Facebook. The event at Xavier University Bhubaneswar, Odisha, also featured actor Nandita Das, stand-up comedian Rajneesh Kapoor and rap artist Big Deal.

Speaking about the Ram Temple issue in Ayodhya, Deo called the demand baseless and added that if one were to look back at the history of India, even the Aryans would be found to be immigrants.

Deo also encouraged people to look forward and not in the past, adding that a future must be considered for cities instead of renaming them.

Deo called Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) an interesting experiment which ""has now become very mundane like other political parties"".

""It can only be revived if Kejriwal reinvents himself,"" said Deo.

However, he added that the issue of pollution in Delhi really bothered him, and wondered why the AAP-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government are not doing anything about it.

He suggested that pollution in the city could be reduced if all the parties came together and provided Rs 7,000 crore to the farmers of Haryana and Punjab to stop burning crop stubble. He said it worried him that the government has ""Rs 10,000 crore to build statues"" but nothing to deal with the grave issue of pollution.

As the #MeToo movement raged on around the world and in India, the political establishment in the country maintained studious silence. On this, Deo said that politicians are very concerned about their goodwill.

""There are already many people who are waiting for reasons to defame politicians so why would a politician let their reputation to damage,"" he said.

Deo, however, added that he was quite surprised that people in the media kept quiet about the issue of sexual harassment for so long.

Both the BJP and the Congress, in their current avatars, are not suitable enough to run the government, said Deo.

""I think BJP has become increasingly autocratic, it doesn't listen to different voices in India and tries to suppress different voices as they exist today,"" he said.

Even as it battles the ruling BJP's ""poaching prowess"", the Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition T.S. Singh Deo firmly believes Chhattisgarh is all set to end 15 years of the BJP's ""misrule and anti-people"" policies.

Voting in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, voting will be held in 18 constituencies in the southern part of the state on November 12, while the second phase of elections will be held on November 20.

""The agrarian crisis, exploitation of tribals and a downward spiraling economy with no jobs are the hallmarks of the Raman Singh government. Reeling under 15-years of misrule, the people, especially farmers and tribals, will vote the Congress to power in the state,"" Singh Deo said in an interview.

Widely considered as one of the party's Chief Ministerial hopefuls, Singh Deo has been leading the Congress campaign in the state that promises complete waiver of farm loans and Rs 2,500 as minimum support price for paddy.

""Under the BJP, Chhattisgarh has consistently been among the top states to account for most number of farm suicides. Annually, more than 1,200 farmers and agriculture labourers end their lives. In fact, the government admitted in Parliament that there have been nearly 2,400 farm suicides between 2014-2016 in the state,"" said Singh Deo, highlighting the deepening crisis in the agriculture sector in the state.

""Its the farmers and tribals who will vote Congress to power,"" said the MLA from Ambikapur.

Notwithstanding Singh Deo's assertions, the Congress is faced with a stiff challenge in the state which, for the first time, will witness a three-way poll battle with arch-rivals Congress and BJP wrestling it out with Mayawati's BSP, which has aligned with the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and the CPI.

Still recovering from the snub by Mayawati, the Congress received a jolt when its state working president and prominent tribal face Ramdayal Uike joined the BJP. Soon after Uike switched loyalties, the BJP allegedly approached Chintamani Maharaj, the Congress MLA from Lundra, offering money and a ministerial berth to quit the party.

Since the 2013 Maoist attack that wiped out its top leadership, including then state unit chief Nand Kumar Patel and party veteran Vidya Charan Shukla, the Congress has been facing a leadership crunch that was further compounded in 2016 when Jogi quit to form his own outfit.

Adding to the problems, Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has been charge-sheeted by the CBI for distributing a pornographic CD allegedly featuring a state minister. He was arrested in September and is now out on bail.

Singh Deo, however, asserted there is no leadership crunch and exuded confidence of the people putting their faith in the Congress.

While the Congress leadership, including President Rahul Gandhi, has refused to read much into Mayawati's alliance with Jogi and the CPI, Singh Deo admitted the BJP's ""poaching prowess"" is a big hurdle.

""The BJP is brazen in using money and muscle power in its bid to decimate the opposition. They have mastered the art of subverting the democratic process. It exposes their political bankruptcy,"" he said, adding that it was good for the Congress to have lost an ""opportunist"" like Uike.

""Going by BJP's way of fighting by by-hook-or-crook, but its the people who would give a befitting reply,"" he said asserting the Congress has been able to reach out to farmers, tribals and the youth who have been the biggest victims of the BJP's ""misrule"".

Asked if the Mayawati-Jogi alliance was a threat to Congress' plans on winning Dalit votes, Singh Deo asserted that both were insignificant players in the state.

""Compared to the Congress securing 40.3 per cent of the vote share and 39 seats in 2013, the BSP got only 4.27 per cent and could win only one seat. Our vote share difference with the BJP (41.04 per cent) was just 0.75 per cent. The people realise that it's only the Congress which is the alternate and they will vote for us. The BSP-Jogi combine is only bidding to hurt our chances,"" he said, asserting that the Congress will come to power with an absolute majority.

Hitting out at the BJP government over the rising Maoist violence, Singh Deo said that bringing the rebels into the mainstream through dialogue and appropriate policies was high on the Congress' agenda.

""Like in other fields, the BJP government has been a complete failure in tackling left- wing extremism. For 15 years, the state has been deprived of any development and even basic amenities like water and roads. Raman Singh is only known for making promises and not fulfilling them. Dialogue with the Maoists and an effective surrender policy will be our way to tackle the issue,"" said Singh Deo.

Polling to the 90-member assembly will be held on November 12 and November 20, with the first phase covering 18 seats, spread across the Maoist-affected districts of Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Kanker, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon. The second phase will cover the remaining 72 seats.

The Congress has fielded a mix of youth and experience with prominent faces including Baghel, Singh Deo and senior leader Satyanarayan Sharma.

Among the main candidates in the first phase is Devati Karma, widow of former state minister Mahendra Karma and founder of the controversial anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia.

Besides reaching out to the people at the grassroots, the Congress is actively running a digital campaign to appeal to both urban and rural voters.

Using social media to reach out to the youth, the party has also been targetting voters in the hinterland, particularity farmers and tribals.

""We have been running a campaign called the '15 saal kayi sawaal' (15 years, many questions) across the state, particularly in rural areas, highlighting how the Raman Singh government has paid only lip-service and all its promises to farmers have remained unfulfilled,"" said Naresh Arora who is spearheading the digital campaign.

""My father and guru, Pt. Rajabhau Deo, was the sculptor of my musical upbringing. He taught me the best aesthetic values of Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur Gharanas for more than 45 years,"" the vocalist told IANS in an email interview.

""Having your guru as a meticulous father is a matter of advantage, but in this journey my father mostly remained strict. He maintained an excellent balance between my upbringing as a growing child, as a growing student of music, as well as a growing academician,"" she said.

Marulkar, who is also trained in the semi-classical repertoire of the Purab music tradition, also teaches young classical singers in the emotive and fluent styles of Purabi 'thumri' and 'dadra'.

She attributes her association with the Purab genre to her prolonged stays in Varanasi, during which her recitals came to be influenced by this style.

The 67-year-old musician -- entitled ""Gaan Saraswati"" by Chandigarh-based Pracheen Kala Kendra -- feels that newer entrants in the music industry do not tend to be selective about their performances.

""We had a strict discrimination in accepting concerts,"" Marulkar said.

""Now, the number of concerts a performer tends to accept does not allow him to observe himself, self-evaluate his concerts and contemplate on the coming assignments,"" she added.

The Jaipur gharana exponent is also known for her intricate analysis of the 'raags' of Indian classical music.

Along with initiating young singers into music, she demonstrates its subtleties with workshops and lectures in education spaces.

This time Congress president Rahul Gandhi is being targeted on social media for a viral photo which shows TS Singh Deo, a cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh. In the viral photo, Deo, who is much older to Gandhi, is seen bowing to touch his feet.

A Facebook page, 'India against Presstitudes', posted this photograph with a message: ""48-year-old senior blessing his 80-year-old junior. My friend Pappu ji is kind"".

Thousands of people shared this post and hundreds commented on it, attacking Rahul and the Congress culture. Many people even doubted if the picture was photoshopped.

India Today's Fact Check team found that the photograph is real. Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo did indeed bow in front of Rahul.

Other Facebook pages like 'Social Tamasha', 'I support Modi Ji and BJP' also carried this picture with various captions hitting out at the Congress president.

In the photograph, one can see a grey-haired man bowing in front of Rahul. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also standing beside Rahul with a bouquet in hand on the red carpet. Senior Congress leader RPN Singh can also be seen in the crowd.

India Today TV spoke to TS Singh Deo to check the claims made on social media regarding the photograph. He confirmed that this is the venue of the swearing-in ceremony on December 17 and he was present there when Rahul Gandhi arrived. However he did not try to touch Rahul's feet and only shook hands. According to him, the photo is morphed.

But at the same time, Deo himself admitted that he has a habit of taking the blessings of senior party leaders by touching their feet on special occasions irrespective of their age.

""On that day too, I touched feet of the guests sitting on the dais after the oath taking,"" said Singh Deo. ""Just after my taking oath as a minister, I even tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the dais but he stopped me from doing it,"" he added.

Singh Deo indeed touched the feet of the guests on the dais and Rahul Gandhi stopped him; this can be seen in this video.

We could not find any supporting video which would have clearly established the sequence of events captured in the viral photo. But we could also not find any evidence to support the claim of Deo that the picture is morphed.

Moreover, when we pressed upon Deo to describe clearly what had happened at that moment, he gave self-contradictory statements. He even talked about picking up a napkin lying on the floor. But no such napkin is visible in the photo.

Looking closely at the photo, we observed that the shadows were aligned perfectly with the characters, hinting that the image is real.

Rajasthan Patrika, a local newspaper, also carried this viral photo claiming that the minister was actually trying to pick up a thread hanging loosely on the floor from the bouquet in Manmohan Singh's hands. But it can be seen that the thread hanging from the bouquet is nowhere close to the floor. Moreover, Singh Deo is bowing in front of Rahul Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh who is standing few steps away.

We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh, who was also present with Rahul. He confirmed that Singh Deo tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.

A viral photo on social media claims that senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo fell at the feet of Congress President Rahul Gandhi soon after taking oath as a cabinet minister in the newly-formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh.

In the picture, Singh Deo is seen bending near Gandhi's feet as Manmohan Singh and other leaders look on.

The photo has gone viral on several Facebook pages related to the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, with the message ""48 साल का युवा 78 साल के बुजुर्ग को आशीर्वाद देते हुए""

The photo was also shared by several other pages like Post Card Fans, My Prime Minister Modi, Social Tamasha and I Support Modi Ji and BJP.

TRUE OR FALSE?

Well, the claim is false on two points. Firstly, he is not 78 years old, as claimed in the message accompanying the photo. Born in 1952, Singh Deo is currently 67 years old, as recorded in the affidavit filed by him for the state Assembly elections.

Secondly, while the photo certainly seems as though the senior leader was falling at the Congress scion's feet, it apparently was not so.

A senior journalist based out of Raipur, who incidentally was at the oath-talking ceremony, confirmed to The Quint that Singh Deo had not bent down to touch Gandhi's feet. In fact, the story is quite different.

""I was there when this particular incident happened, Singh Deo had bent down not to touch Gandhi's feet, but to pick up a piece of thread that had fallen off the bouquet that Manmohan Singh was carrying. He definitely did not fall at Gandhi's feet.""Senior journalist to The Quint

Rajasthan Patrika, too, carried the viral photo with a small caption explaining the incident.

The daily had also zoomed into the photo to show the piece of thread that had fallen near Gandhi's feet.

BHUPESH BAGHEL SWORN IN AS CM

The new cabinet in Chhattisgarh was sworn in on Monday, 17 December, with Bhupesh Bagehl taking the mantle as chief minister. Senior leaders Tamradhwaj Sahu and TS Singh Deo were sworn in as ministers.

The party has not appointed any deputy chief minister for the state.

The Congress won a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh, bagging 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with only 15 seats, and Mayawati-Ajit Jogi's JCC+ alliance managed to win in 7 constituencies.

Singh Deo is likely to get the key portfolio of Finance and and Tamradhwaj Sahu either Agriculture or Public Works. The allocation of portfolios in the Bhupesh Baghel Cabinet is expected to be completed by December 24, Congress sources say.

Mr. Baghel is expected to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi soon to discuss the allocation, said a Congress leader, who did not wish to be identified. Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been in the reckoning for the top job in the State, were sworn in along with Mr. Baghel on Monday.

A day after pictures of the beaming trio holding hands with Mr. Gandhi were broadcast from Raipur, the jockeying for the meaty assignments has begun.

According to party officials, Mr. Deo had made it clear that having missed out on the top post, he should be given the Finance portfolio, which would enable him to influence key policies. The former Leader of the Opposition is considered the brain behind the party's manifesto, or Jan Ghoshna Patra, which promised a farm loan waiver and a minimum support price of ₹2,500 a quintal for paddy.

Mr. Sahu, who belongs to the dominant Sahu community, an OBC caste, could get either Agriculture or the Public Works portfolio, a party leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been seen by some as a favourite of the party's leaders in Delhi, lost out after Mr. Baghel, Mr. Deo and former Chattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Charan Das Mahant all opposed his candidature, party leaders said. A miffed Mr. Sahu had walked out of the meeting before being placated by the party leadership, the sources said. The idea of having Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu share the top job, with each occupying the post for two-and-a-half years, was also briefly considered before being dropped as many felt that it would send out a wrong message, especially after the Congress had won such a decisive mandate.

Within hours of taking the reins on Monday, the Congress government cleared a waiver of farm loans amounting to ₹6,100 crore which would help over 16 lakh farmers. It also announced the promised support price for paddy and a decision to set up a special investigation team to probe the Maoist ambush of 2013 in the Jiram Valley, in which the party's top leaders in the State were all killed."

ADC Basholi, ACD, CMO, CEO, SDMs of Bani and Hiranagar, Principals of Degree Colleges of Kathua, District Coordinator NYK, Principal ITI and Dy DEO were present in the meeting.

The DEO, while elaborating on salient features of the initiative, said that the entire project revolves around keeping voter education relevant and practical through a host of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular methods for the young (18-21 years) and future (14-17 years) voters. ""Election Commission of India is committed towards inclusion of electoral literacy through the medium of Electoral Literacy Clubs (ELCs) in educational institutions, organisations as well as in rural communities via Chunav Pathshalas,"" he added.

He directed the Chief Education Officer and Principals of various degree colleges of the district to sensitize students regarding addition, deletion, correction and transposition of names in voter lists. He also asked for providing data of students with disabilities studying in higher classes so that required facilities can be provided to them at polling centers.

DEO asked ACD to seek cooperation of newly elected Panchs and Sarpanchs in creating awareness on SSR with respect to 1st January 2019 as qualifying date. He asked the District Youth Services and Sports Department to generate mass awareness on SSR during Khelo India Programmes and other sports activities. He also advised the EROs and AEROs to monitor the disposal of claims on daily basis.

Dy DEO, Chand Kishore Sharma, informed the meeting that ELC is a platform to engage school and college students through interesting activities and hands-on experience to sensitize them on their electoral rights and familiarize them with the electoral process of registration and voting besides developing a culture of electoral participation.

He said that ELCs shall have no association with any political party or political group and none of the ELC activities should involve partisan forces in any form.

After four days of protracted deliberations and brainstorming, Congress president Rahul Gandhi finally took the decision on who the chief minister should be. The announcement was made in Raipur on Sunday afternoon.

Baghel's rise in state politics began almost five years ago, after the top leadership of the Chhattisgarh Congress was wiped out in a Maoist attack at Jhiram Ghati in Bastar on 25 May, 2013.

The Ajit Jogi-led Congress had lost to the BJP in the 2003 Assembly election. Thereafter, the party also lost the elections in 2008 and 2013, which weakened the organisation deeply.

Baghel's first challenge after taking over as Chhattisgarh Congress chief four years ago was to consolidate the faction-ridden party and strengthen it at the grassroots level. It was certainly a tough task, especially when the BJP had been wielding immense power at the Centre and in the state.

After the election results were announced on 11 December, Rahul sought a referendum through an app called 'Shakti' - a unique experiment of sorts in Chhattisgarh. Nearly two lakh party workers, including the newly-elected legislators, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate.

According to sources, Singh Deo was earlier ahead of Baghel in the race for the post of chief minister. However, after a meeting of the Congress' top leadership in Delhi, followed by a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party, the party zeroed in on Baghel's name.

Factors in favour of Baghel

Baghel, the 57-year-old MLA from Patan, was deputy leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. He belongs to the Kurmi caste, which is considered a backward one. He has served as a minister in both the Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. After he became president of Chhattisgarh Congress in October 2014, he toured the state on foot and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

Even when he was a minister in the Ajit Jogi government, he had been a strong critic of Jogi, and the two never got along well. After Jogi quit the Congress and became its most bitter critic, the party leadership wanted someone to take both Jogi and the ruling Raman Singh government head on. Baghel was believed to be the right choice.

Baghel is known for his aggressive style of leadership, which has also attracted criticism from a section of party workers. However, this warrior-like image helped him to take the party to victory. The Congress got a landslide victory by winning 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, while the BJP got only 15 seats.

Baghel had been in jail for 14 days on charges of circulating a ""sex CD"" involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government. The BJP claimed that the CD was a fabricated one. However, the issue boomeranged against the saffron party, as the jail term became a factor in favour of Baghel.

While Baghel has been a minister, he also has age on his side. He is younger than Singh Deo and another contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu.

""Baghel's strong anti-establishment image, and his agitations over agrarian issues and rural distress, acted in his favour. He has been vocal against the RSS-BJP combine and has exposed corruption in the Raman Singh government. With strong secular credentials, he led the Congress' fight against the BJP,"" Ruchir Garg, a former senior journalist who joined Chhattisgarh Congress before the polls, told Firstpost.

Garg added, ""As he has strong organisational skills, he consolidated the Congress in Chhattisgarh and acted against anti-party people.""

However, the role of TS Singh Deo in the Congress' performance cannot be undermined. The party's manifesto, considered unique among such documents presented by the party in other states, played a pivotal role in the party's landslide victory.

Singh Deo, 66, popularly known as 'TS Baba"" across the state, was the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, and represents Ambikapur.

According to party sources, Rahul hailed the manifesto as a unique experiment and asked his research and analytics team to study and replicate it for the 2019 general election.

""Prior to the drafting of the manifesto, party leaders went to the masses and understood their hopes and aspirations, before coming out with a list of the ""doable"" promises in their manifesto. This ensured that no section of the society was left uncared for. It also ensured that the chances of the party defaulting on its promises were less,"" Chhattisgarh-based political commentator Parivesh Mishra said.

""Often, the drafting of a party manifesto is given low priority, and is done behind closed doors. Many promises are left unfulfilled. However, the Congress' Vachan Patra this time had short and long-term goals, with deadlines,"" he added.

The third contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu (69), the only Lok Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh, is known as Rahul's Man Friday. However, after the result of the survey of the ""Shakti"" app came out, his name was all but ruled out as a chief minsiterial candidate. According to political analysts, Sahu's candidature for the chief minister's post came up quite late.

In a letter submitted to the district education officer (DEO), Hyderabad, the management stated that the revision has been rolled out keeping with government orders that stipulate schools to adhere by a fixed structure for fee, teachers' salaries and other expenses. Accordingly, the school that was charging kindergarten students ?1.22 lakh per year, will now charge ?57,100 per child. For students in Classes 1 to 4, the revised fee is ?61,600 while for those in Classes 5 to 7 it is ?66,000 per year.

""While we received complaints against four schools, this particular school was found violating norms mentioned in GO Ms No. 1. As per the order, a school should spend at least 50% of the fee on teachers' salaries and 15% on maintenance. However, in this case, the school was spending less than 50% of the fee on teachers and were found allocating more for maintenance,"" said B Venkata Narasamma, DEO, Hyderabad. She said that these discrepancies came to the fore during an enquiry conducted on DPS, Mahendra Hills.

Among other illegalities, the school was also found fleecing students who did not opt for extra-curricular activities. ""If a school is providing activities like swimming, dancing or sports, it cannot add that amount to the fee of all students. The fee should be different for those signing up for them and those who aren't,"" Narasamma added.

Apart from being pulled up by the DEO, the school management also had a case filed against them by activist Vijay Gopal who dragged several schools to the court for charging exorbitant fees.

Speaking about the recent revision, Gopal said: ""Now that the school has accepted its fault, as per rules mentioned in the education act, the management must face a minimum punishment of three years in jail. Also, they must be forced to return the excess fee, to parents, collected over the last decade or so.""

He maintained that the ongoing case will not be dropped just because the school has slashed the fee.

""Once the management of this particular school is awarded jail term, all the other erring schools will fall in line,"" Gopal said, adding, ""if the verdict in the lower court is in favour of the school, I will approach the high court to get justice."""

It was this manifesto, especially the promises relating to farmers, that many believe became a game-changer in the party's bid to dislodge a populist chief minister.

The Congress has not come up with a clear choice yet, even after the referendum party chief Rahul Gandhi had sought on Wednesday through an app called 'Shakti'. A unique experiment of sorts, more than three lakh party workers, including elected Congress candidates, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate for Chhattisgarh.

After hectic parleys at Hotel Babylon in state capital Raipur on Wednesday, two names emerged on the basis of the referendum through 'Shakti' and a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party in the presence of central observer and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge. According to party sources, between former Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly TS Singh Deo and Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, the former is the front-runner for the chief minister's post at present. However, the party hasn't announced the name and is waiting for Rahul to take the final call.

""At our end, we conveyed our decision regarding the chief ministerial candidate. Unlike Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we don't have a national-level leader for the post, so there's no debate over selection. Now the final decision will be made in Delhi by the party president,"" a Chhattisgarh Congress party source told Firstpost.

File photo of Congress leader TS Singh Deo.

Similar to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the supporters of the two contenders for the office of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh have now got into clashes over the issue of ""Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri"" (who will be the chief minister).

Outside Baghel's house in Raipur, the Chhattisgarh Congress chief's supporters got into a brawl with Deo's backers on Thursday. Even in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia gathered at Indira Bhawan -- the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters -- with large cut-outs and posters, shouting slogans in Scindia's favour and demanding his appointment as the chief minister.

Chhattisgarh is the only state among the three that the Congress won where Rahul used the 'Shakti' app to know party workers' choice of chief minister. Project Shakti is an internal digital platform of the party that aims to link all Congress workers countrywide with party president.

So finally, who is likely to be the Chhattisgarh chief minister? Let's look at the choices.

Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, popularly known as ""TS Baba"" across the state, is the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, representing the Ambikapur constituency. A scion of the famous Surguja princely state and son of former chief secretary of undivided Madhya Pradesh MS Singh Deo, the 66-year-old exercises strong influence and popularity in Surguja, which attests to the fact that of the eight Assembly seats in the district, the Congress had won seven in the last election.

Pros: TS Singh Deo is suave and articulate. According to sources, most Chhattisgarh Congress party workers favoured his candidature over Baghel's in both the Shakti referendum and at the Congress Legislative Party meeting. Deo was also the brain behind the Chhattisgarh Congress manifesto, which was considered unique among the five manifestos the party released ahead of the Assembly elections.

""During the making of this manifesto, TS Singh Deo extended his reach to beyond Congress workers. He met every section of the society across the state, discussed issues with them, took their feedback and incorporated them in the manifesto. This exercise helped him get connected with as many voters as possible in Chhattisgarh and made him popular simultaneously. This manifesto, which has been hailed as a unique experiment by Rahul Gandhi, proved to be a game-changer in this election,"" political commentator Parivesh Mishra told Firstpost.

Con: His business ties with a big business house can prove to be a handicap, as some party workers pointed out. ""There can be conflict of interest with our party line,"" an elected member said on condition of anonymity.

Bhupesh Baghel, an MLA from Patan, was the deputy Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly. A backward-class leader (Kurmi), the 57-year-old has served as minister in both Digvijaya Singh and Ajit Jogi's cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Active in social reform works, Baghel toured Chhattisgarh on foot before the elections and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

File photo of Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel. PTI

Pros: Baghel virtually revived the party and gave shape to a new Congress after becoming Pradesh Congress Committee chief five years ago. He has strong organisational skills and is a more grassroots party worker in comparison. He actively campaigned across Chhattisgarh this election.

Con: According to insiders, Baghel's leadership style is not acceptable to many workers in the faction-ridden party in the state. His name had emerged in the alleged case of sleaze CDs involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government ahead of the election. A special CBI court had sent him to 14-day judicial custody in the case.

Two other leaders, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charandas Mahant, who were earlier in the fray for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's chair, are now apparently out of the race.

A 66-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Durg and a leader of the Sahu community, which has a sizeable presence in Chhattisgarh among Other Backward Classes, Sahu is now a fence-sitter. ""In case the Congress top leadership disagrees on Deo and Baghel, Sahu may become the chief minister. But the chances are bleak,"" a party leader said.

While finalising the candidate for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's post, the party leadership also has to consider who can play a pivotal role in maximising the party's tally in Chhattisgarh and mobilise resources in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Besides, the party also has to fulfil the promises it made to voters in the state ahead of the polls.

Although it was initially believed that selecting the Chhattisgarh chief minister would be a comparatively easy task for the Congress, unlike in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, it seems that it's going to be another tight-rope walk for Rahul.

This clearly was a vote for the Congress. BJP has been routed because the Congress presented a very acceptable and clear option. The people of Chhattisgarh did not give a negative vote against any party.

Mankind has not only reached the moon and we have gone even beyond. And we have only made practical promises. We are looking at roughly a budget of Rs 1 lakh crore. We will obviously have to look at ways to generate additional revenue, cut expenses and prioritise. It is difficult but doable and will be done.

Obviously, Narendra Modi's magic didn't work, they did not even cross 20 seats. And Raman Singh, nice guy, a smiling face. He had been in power for 15 years and in all these years nothing really stuck to him. There were talks but still nothing stuck to him. But his own victory margin came down. Obviously, they were on a back foot. But such a massive victory, not only in terms of number of MLAs but in amount of vote share shows that it is the people's victory. And that our (Congress) president Rahul Gandhi managed to connect to the people.

In every election in the State the margin between Congress and BJP has never gone above 2 per cent. But at the same time, in Lok Sabha elections, which are usually held 4-6 months after the State Assembly polls, the margin widens. So obviously whichever party wins the State also impacts the Lok Sabha outcome too.

And more importantly, a chain has been formed in the Hindi heartland. Out of 65 seats in three States (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan) Congress only had five seats here. Even if we were to hand over half of the 65 seats to BJP it will no longer be in majority in the Lok Sabha."

This time, the coalition between Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), former chief minister Ajit Jogi's Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and Communist Party of India (CPI) added another dimension to the poll politics of Chhattisgarh, which has always been dominated by the BJP and the Congress.

Several exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the big two.

Of the 90 Assembly segments, 51 are for the general category while 10 segments are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes.

In the last Assembly polls, the BJP had won 49, the Congress won 39, while one seat each was bagged by the BSP and an Independent.

Chhattisgarh Assembly Elections 2018 Results Live News Updates: Congress Heading Towards Huge Majority, Set For Landslide Victory.

The three leading faces for the post of Chief Minister in Chhattisgarh are Bhupesh Baghel, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo or T.S. Singh Deo. The three faces were actively involved in the campaigning and the Congress High Commission may go with any of the names considering their popularity.

Considering that the Kurmis and Sahus are two dominant communities in the OBCs category, these names hold high possibility when it comes to winning the chief ministers hat. Together, these communities account for 36 percent of the total population. Bhupesh Baghel and Tamradhwaj Sahu will be the two most important faces that the Congress will consider when it thinks about its CM nominee as they belong to these dominant categories. Sahu is also a member of Congress Working Committee (CWC). While Baghel is the Congress party's state chief."

Edited excerpts:

How do see the 2018 assembly elections? Can your party form the next government?

We are wining this election. Sometimes there is a sense of undercurrent -- where there is a movement towards you -- but I am seeing a wave. There is a great sense of dissatisfaction that has transformed into wave to remove BJP.

Former Congress CM Ajit Jogi has formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and now contesting in an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party. What impact will he make?

Jogi was given a golden opportunity by Sonia [Gandhi] ji and the Congress leadership. He had only two MLAs with him when the state was formed. Jogi was seen as a capable person to rule the state, but he lost his chance. He wanted to create his own team, resulting in groupism. This led to the Congress losing the election. We are happy that Jogi is not with the Congress because he was sabotaging the party and helping the BJP.

Do you think Jogi can go with the BJP?

He is with the BJP; he is working for the BJP. But the Congress is getting a clear majority this time.

Who will be the CM if the Congress wins Chhattisgarh?

We have many faces. Two months ago, we met Rahul [Gandhi] ji along with other senior Congress leaders where it was decided that we will fight this election without any face. In Uttar Pradesh, BJP had not projected anyone and bagged 80% seats.

What will be Congress strategy in case we get a hung assembly?

We will certainly not join hands with Ajit Jogi. We will go back to people. If we can't fight an election with him, how can we form a government? We have responsibility towards people ...Coming back is power is not the sole criteria.

It is said that even after being in power for 15 years, Raman Singh is seen a reliable and trusted face. Do you agree?

It may have been so in 2008 but not now because Raman Singh did not fulfil his poll promises. His schemes are not working, electricity situation is bad, and all this has affected his image.

What about the infighting in the state unit of the Congress?

I don't think there is infighting in the Congress in Chhattisgarh. Nobody talks about the infighting in the BJP. Isn't there a fight between Raman Singh and [agriculture minister] Brijmohan Agarwal? Everyone knows who leaked documents showing Agarwal in bad light. And documents regarding scams by Raman Singh are also being leaked. Who is doing it in the BJP?"

MLA from Ambikapur constituency since 2008, Deo is touted as one of the frontrunners to be the chief ministerial picks if Congress comes to power. In a detailed conversation with Parth MN, Deo spoke about the need to improve the standard of living of tribals. He criticised the Raman Singh government for prioritising corporate interests over tribals, alleging that the BJP-led government has neglected their interests, which has resulted in an economic mismatch in Chhattisgarh. Popularly known as TS Baba, Deo, who belongs to the royal family, condemned the arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, who has lived in Chhattisgarh almost all her life.

Edited excerpts from the interview

If the Congress comes to power in Chhattisgarh, what would be your policy regarding the tribals, who form a major population of the state?

Tribals form about 31 percent of the population in Chhattisgarh. Their population has reduced by 1 percent in the last census. They live mostly in jungle areas, which is less productive as far as the agriculture is concerned. So the main concern for their development is to provide them with means of livelihood other than agriculture.

Which would be?

Their natural habitat is the forest. So, one could be forest produce, two could be tourism, third could be handicrafts, fourth could be their rights in mining areas which they have been denied, and government jobs. The idea is to provide a better standard of living. If you make a road, it is of no consequence unless it improves your standard of living. If you make a school, it is of no use unless it improves the standard of living. It's important for them to make the best of the environment they live in. If you are bringing in industry and it is not providing jobs to them, if you are doing mining activity and they don't have any share of it, it is of no consequence. For example, in Kondagaon, they told me there are around 70,000-80,000 people engaged in cottage industry where they make gun metal statues. I met the workers during the process of making the people's manifesto. And one could see very easily where they are falling behind. There are middlemen who help the tribal with the raw material, and for their profit margins to be higher, they sell the finished good at a price lower than the market price. The tribals complained regarding the handicraft corporation which has been formed. There, too, it is a matter of commission mongering. There is a large market for such products, which are of interest and value to the people within the country and even to export markets. Unfortunately, no government has thought of pushing them in a big way.

You said tribal population has decreased by one percent. What is the reason?

The survey was not done in 100 villages, so it could mean that 500 people in a village on an average, which is 50,000. It is not a small number. Several groups are migrating because of pressure from the Naxals and lack of employment in the state, among other things. Other reason could also be the rise in the number of people coming from outside the state. Reasons behind falling percent in the number of tribals in the state are mostly migration out of tribal areas and migration into Chhattisgarh. There is no proof to conclude that drop in birth rate is the reason.

What are the policies of the Raman Singh government regarding the tribals which you particularly object to?

It is basically neglect. There is a sense of complacency in the current government -- no matter what happens, we win. There is a lot of bureaucracy in the ruling government and Raman Singh is completely dependent on that. So long as they are delivering him a government, election after election, Raman Singh has left Chhattisgarh to be managed by the bureaucrats.

Has the tribal situation worsened in the past 15 years?

Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of BPL families in the country. At least, 39.93 percent is the reserve bank figure for average BPL families - urban and rural combined - for Chhattisgarh. It is the highest in the country. For a state that is supposed to be developing, something is going wrong. If the per capita income has crossed 90,000 and your family is an average of 4.53. By that calculation a family in Chhattisgarh should earn 4.5 lakh rupees. Tribals aren't earning even close to it. It basically indicates that a few people are earning a lot and the tribals are marginalised. If you are able to project the per capita is increasing, where is the money going?

Tribals are angry with Raman Singh for opening up their forests to the private players. How do you plan to manage them if you come to power?

Whether they are tribals or non-tribals, so long as they are residents of Chhattisgarh, you should target those reserves that displace the least. Secondly, if you are saying that in the next coming years, you are going to change the technology to non-traditional means of production of electricity, that is non-coal based electricity, you are not going to need coal. If you don't need all of this coal, where does it reside? If this coal resides in tribal areas only, then you don't have an option. But if there is coal in non-tribal areas, where the land could be more expensive, then the government is duty bound not to help the industry by getting cheaper land, which is forest and tribal land, in comparison to the land that may be more expensive but lie in non-tribal areas.

How do you plan to correct that?

Don't allot it to them.

Would it be as easy?

Yes, if you have the will. Lemru is an area between Surguja and Korba. It is a forest area of 450 square kilometers. This government had itself projected it as an elephant reserve. The UPA government had approved it. After the approval, Raman Singh government stalled it because they wanted to give it for mining. In our manifesto, we have included that areas like Lemru would be de-reserved for coal block allocation.

When I met the youth in tribal areas, they weren't exactly averse to industries. But they didn't trust the state and corporations coming in and working in their areas. They didn't trust them to provide adequate rehabilitation and compensation policies.

The section of society that is most opposed to land being taken over are the women. They are most opposed to being uprooted. Because, socially, they are the most affected and they are also the most exploited lot -- their lifestyle changes completely. They feel alientated. Then you have the male members, who go by how much will they get and what will they get. Then there is the youth -- after studying and switching over to wearing jeans, how many would like to till the land? They are looking for a different way of life. It is influenced by what they see on TV, or when they go to cities.

Social media has played a role in it?

Yes. The youth is not averse to land being taken. Yet, the rights of the landowners should have priority. The new land acquisition act requires 70-80 percent of the landowners.

But the biggest gripe of tribals is that the Forest Rights Act is not enforced and the consent is often ignored or forged.

We change that by governing better.

After having endured exploitation, there are several people who feel no matter who comes to power, the bureaucracy remains by and large the same.

We would like to believe that we are the kind of team that changes that.

There is an argument that the adivasis are torn between Naxals and police. How do plan to combat it?

When people use force to get power, then people will be seen standing behind whoever is in power and dominant. Historically, entire population never rebels. Eventually, the tendency is to accept whoever is stronger. In the Naxal area, whoever is seen to be stronger, will be able to subdue the population. The question is do people want to be with the Naxals or do they stand with the State? They would just want to be free. They do not like any pressure from anybody in their day to day lives. Basic nature of a tribal is independence. Among the adivasis, discontent begins when they are falsely accused of being Naxals, jailed for three-four years and then let off over lack of evidence.

Secondly, if Naxals or other organisations, that have the means to be dominant in that area, and are able to have their presence felt, why would people be listening to them? Either it is genuine support, where people feel the Constitution is a piece of paper worth nothing. I don't think that's what the people of Chhattisgarh think. Those villagers, who aren't fully educated, don't understand the matters of state or Constitution. It is a matter of making your dominance in an area through the ideology that you purport to believe in, using force to create dominance, and using people either as supporters - genuine or under pressure - or because you want to use them as shields. The informer is the target number one, not the exploiter. Had the exploiter been the target, we would have felt they are ideologically inclined.

You mentioned how the people are jailed and then let off for no proof. Sudha Bharadwaj has lived almost all her life in Chhattisgarh. She is in jail. What do you have to say about her arrest?

I have met her on a number of occasions. And she is a committed lady. Committed to the cause of those in need. She has given up better options in her career. The government does not have proof, and it is just trying to create pressure because somebody doesn't agree with what they are saying. No state organisation can make false charges against people to make their ends meet. She is an honest woman of high morale and ethical values. These are the people we need. If she has Maoist links, bring them out. What are you waiting for?

New Delhi: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo Friday said he strongly opposed criminal defamation and that nobody should be arrested on the basis of what they think.

Deo's comments on free speech come in the backdrop of the arrest of Right-leaning defence analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra over a joke by the BJD-led Odisha government.

Speaking about the right to free speech, he said, ""The government has no right to tell us what we should eat, wear or how we should behave in our bedrooms.""

Deo was in conversation with ThePrint's National and Strategic Affairs Editor Jyoti Malhotra at the twelfth edition of Democracy Wall.

Democracy Wall is a monthly free speech campus initiative organised by ThePrint in collaboration with Facebook. The event at Xavier University Bhubaneswar, Odisha, also featured actor Nandita Das, stand-up comedian Rajneesh Kapoor and rap artist Big Deal.

Speaking about the Ram Temple issue in Ayodhya, Deo called the demand baseless and added that if one were to look back at the history of India, even the Aryans would be found to be immigrants.

Deo also encouraged people to look forward and not in the past, adding that a future must be considered for cities instead of renaming them.

Deo called Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) an interesting experiment which ""has now become very mundane like other political parties"".

""It can only be revived if Kejriwal reinvents himself,"" said Deo.

However, he added that the issue of pollution in Delhi really bothered him, and wondered why the AAP-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government are not doing anything about it.

He suggested that pollution in the city could be reduced if all the parties came together and provided Rs 7,000 crore to the farmers of Haryana and Punjab to stop burning crop stubble. He said it worried him that the government has ""Rs 10,000 crore to build statues"" but nothing to deal with the grave issue of pollution.

As the #MeToo movement raged on around the world and in India, the political establishment in the country maintained studious silence. On this, Deo said that politicians are very concerned about their goodwill.

""There are already many people who are waiting for reasons to defame politicians so why would a politician let their reputation to damage,"" he said.

Deo, however, added that he was quite surprised that people in the media kept quiet about the issue of sexual harassment for so long.

Both the BJP and the Congress, in their current avatars, are not suitable enough to run the government, said Deo.

""I think BJP has become increasingly autocratic, it doesn't listen to different voices in India and tries to suppress different voices as they exist today,"" he said.

Even as it battles the ruling BJP's ""poaching prowess"", the Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition T.S. Singh Deo firmly believes Chhattisgarh is all set to end 15 years of the BJP's ""misrule and anti-people"" policies.

Voting in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, voting will be held in 18 constituencies in the southern part of the state on November 12, while the second phase of elections will be held on November 20.

""The agrarian crisis, exploitation of tribals and a downward spiraling economy with no jobs are the hallmarks of the Raman Singh government. Reeling under 15-years of misrule, the people, especially farmers and tribals, will vote the Congress to power in the state,"" Singh Deo said in an interview.

Widely considered as one of the party's Chief Ministerial hopefuls, Singh Deo has been leading the Congress campaign in the state that promises complete waiver of farm loans and Rs 2,500 as minimum support price for paddy.

""Under the BJP, Chhattisgarh has consistently been among the top states to account for most number of farm suicides. Annually, more than 1,200 farmers and agriculture labourers end their lives. In fact, the government admitted in Parliament that there have been nearly 2,400 farm suicides between 2014-2016 in the state,"" said Singh Deo, highlighting the deepening crisis in the agriculture sector in the state.

""Its the farmers and tribals who will vote Congress to power,"" said the MLA from Ambikapur.

Notwithstanding Singh Deo's assertions, the Congress is faced with a stiff challenge in the state which, for the first time, will witness a three-way poll battle with arch-rivals Congress and BJP wrestling it out with Mayawati's BSP, which has aligned with the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and the CPI.

Still recovering from the snub by Mayawati, the Congress received a jolt when its state working president and prominent tribal face Ramdayal Uike joined the BJP. Soon after Uike switched loyalties, the BJP allegedly approached Chintamani Maharaj, the Congress MLA from Lundra, offering money and a ministerial berth to quit the party.

Since the 2013 Maoist attack that wiped out its top leadership, including then state unit chief Nand Kumar Patel and party veteran Vidya Charan Shukla, the Congress has been facing a leadership crunch that was further compounded in 2016 when Jogi quit to form his own outfit.

Adding to the problems, Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has been charge-sheeted by the CBI for distributing a pornographic CD allegedly featuring a state minister. He was arrested in September and is now out on bail.

Singh Deo, however, asserted there is no leadership crunch and exuded confidence of the people putting their faith in the Congress.

While the Congress leadership, including President Rahul Gandhi, has refused to read much into Mayawati's alliance with Jogi and the CPI, Singh Deo admitted the BJP's ""poaching prowess"" is a big hurdle.

""The BJP is brazen in using money and muscle power in its bid to decimate the opposition. They have mastered the art of subverting the democratic process. It exposes their political bankruptcy,"" he said, adding that it was good for the Congress to have lost an ""opportunist"" like Uike.

""Going by BJP's way of fighting by by-hook-or-crook, but its the people who would give a befitting reply,"" he said asserting the Congress has been able to reach out to farmers, tribals and the youth who have been the biggest victims of the BJP's ""misrule"".

Asked if the Mayawati-Jogi alliance was a threat to Congress' plans on winning Dalit votes, Singh Deo asserted that both were insignificant players in the state.

""Compared to the Congress securing 40.3 per cent of the vote share and 39 seats in 2013, the BSP got only 4.27 per cent and could win only one seat. Our vote share difference with the BJP (41.04 per cent) was just 0.75 per cent. The people realise that it's only the Congress which is the alternate and they will vote for us. The BSP-Jogi combine is only bidding to hurt our chances,"" he said, asserting that the Congress will come to power with an absolute majority.

Hitting out at the BJP government over the rising Maoist violence, Singh Deo said that bringing the rebels into the mainstream through dialogue and appropriate policies was high on the Congress' agenda.

""Like in other fields, the BJP government has been a complete failure in tackling left- wing extremism. For 15 years, the state has been deprived of any development and even basic amenities like water and roads. Raman Singh is only known for making promises and not fulfilling them. Dialogue with the Maoists and an effective surrender policy will be our way to tackle the issue,"" said Singh Deo.

Polling to the 90-member assembly will be held on November 12 and November 20, with the first phase covering 18 seats, spread across the Maoist-affected districts of Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Kanker, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon. The second phase will cover the remaining 72 seats.

The Congress has fielded a mix of youth and experience with prominent faces including Baghel, Singh Deo and senior leader Satyanarayan Sharma.

Among the main candidates in the first phase is Devati Karma, widow of former state minister Mahendra Karma and founder of the controversial anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia.

Besides reaching out to the people at the grassroots, the Congress is actively running a digital campaign to appeal to both urban and rural voters.

Using social media to reach out to the youth, the party has also been targetting voters in the hinterland, particularity farmers and tribals.

""We have been running a campaign called the '15 saal kayi sawaal' (15 years, many questions) across the state, particularly in rural areas, highlighting how the Raman Singh government has paid only lip-service and all its promises to farmers have remained unfulfilled,"" said Naresh Arora who is spearheading the digital campaign.

""My father and guru, Pt. Rajabhau Deo, was the sculptor of my musical upbringing. He taught me the best aesthetic values of Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur Gharanas for more than 45 years,"" the vocalist told IANS in an email interview.

""Having your guru as a meticulous father is a matter of advantage, but in this journey my father mostly remained strict. He maintained an excellent balance between my upbringing as a growing child, as a growing student of music, as well as a growing academician,"" she said.

Marulkar, who is also trained in the semi-classical repertoire of the Purab music tradition, also teaches young classical singers in the emotive and fluent styles of Purabi 'thumri' and 'dadra'.

She attributes her association with the Purab genre to her prolonged stays in Varanasi, during which her recitals came to be influenced by this style.

The 67-year-old musician -- entitled ""Gaan Saraswati"" by Chandigarh-based Pracheen Kala Kendra -- feels that newer entrants in the music industry do not tend to be selective about their performances.

""We had a strict discrimination in accepting concerts,"" Marulkar said.

""Now, the number of concerts a performer tends to accept does not allow him to observe himself, self-evaluate his concerts and contemplate on the coming assignments,"" she added.

The Jaipur gharana exponent is also known for her intricate analysis of the 'raags' of Indian classical music.

Along with initiating young singers into music, she demonstrates its subtleties with workshops and lectures in education spaces.

""Music cannot be confined into a syllabus-based teaching plan,"" asserted Marulkar, who says her constant inspirations in her repertoire remain Pt. Siddheshwari Devi, Pt. Girija Devi and Pt. Nirmala Arun.

The musician will be performing the musical forms of 'khayal' and semi-classical compositions at the National Centre for Performing Arts here on Thursday.

He demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders of the BJP should clear the party's stand and bar party functionaries from disrespectful remarks about gods and goddesses.

The seer's reaction came after Uttar Pradesh Religious Affair Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary dubbed Lord Hanuman as a Jat, saying like Jats, the deity never tolerated injustice towards anybody, anywhere.

The minister made the remark Friday after a BJP MLC from the state, Bukkal Nawab, dubbed Lord Hanuman a Muslim on the ground that his name rhymed with Islamic names like Rahman, Arman, Qurban etc.

During an election rally in Rajasthan, Adityanath had termed the deity a Dalit.

The chief minister had hurt religious sentiments by terming Lord Hanuman a Dalit, even as his office later issued a clarification, claiming that Adityanath was misquoted, the shankaracharya said.

""Adityanath and other leaders' remarks on Hanuman have vitiated the atmosphere in the country,"" the seer said.

Lord Hanuman has been termed a Jat, Thakur, a sportsman and even a Muslim, even though gods and goddesses are above caste and religion, he stated.

Uttar Pradesh Sports Minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan had said on Sunday that Hanuman was a sportsperson.

However, he had dismissed his party colleagues' attempts at identifying the deity's caste and said gods don't have castes.

The seer asked the BJP to clear its stand on the remarks and claimed no clarification was issued by the party on the statements on Lord Hanuman.

""The silence by BJP higher ups and RSS functionaries (on the remarks on Lord Hanuman) indicates that for the BJP, the Ram temple is a tool to garner votes,"" he said, adding that the temple in Ayodhya will be constructed by seers and dharmacharyas.

He demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other top leaders of the BJP should clear the party's stand and bar party functionaries from making such distasteful remarks about Hindu gods and goddesses.

The seer's reaction came days after Uttar Pradesh Religious Affair Minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary dubbed Lord Hanuman as a 'Jat', saying like Jats, the deity never tolerated injustice towards anybody, anywhere.

The minister made the remark on Friday after a BJP MLC from the state, Bukkal Nawab, dubbed Lord Hanuman as a 'Muslim' on the ground that his name rhymed with Islamic names like Rahman, Arman, Qurban etc.

During an election rally in Rajasthan, UP CM Adityanath had called the deity a 'Dalit'.

""On one side the BJP, from time to time, has been bringing up the Ram temple issue and on the other, its leaders are making absurd remarks on Hindu gods and goddesses, hurting religious sentiments,"" Shankaracharya Adhokshajanand Deo Tirth said.

""The Ram temple in Ayodhya will be incomplete without Lord Hanuman as Ram had himself praised Hanuman Ji calling him like his brother Bharat,"" he said.

If the remark made by Nawab has the BJP high-command's approval, ""then the party will have to get a mosque constructed for Lord Hanuman"", the seer said.

The Chief Minister had hurt religious sentiments by terming Lord Hanuman a Dalit, even as his office later issued a clarification, claiming that Adityanath was misquoted, the Shankaracharya said.

""Adityanath and other leaders' remarks on Hanuman have vitiated the atmosphere in the country,"" the seer said.

Lord Hanuman has been termed a Jat, Thakur, a sportsman and even a Muslim, even though gods and goddesses are above caste and religion, he stated.

Interestingly, Uttar Pradesh Sports Minister and former cricketer Chetan Chauhan had said on Sunday that Hanuman was a sportsperson.

However, he had dismissed his party colleagues' attempts at identifying the deity's caste and said gods don't have castes.

The seer asked the BJP to clear its stand on the remarks and claimed no clarification was issued by the party on the statements on Lord Hanuman.

""The silence by BJP top brass and RSS functionaries (on the remarks on Lord Hanuman) indicates that for the BJP, the Ram temple is a tool to garner votes,"" he said, adding that the temple in Ayodhya will be constructed by seers and dharmacharyas."

This time Congress president Rahul Gandhi is being targeted on social media for a viral photo which shows TS Singh Deo, a cabinet minister in the newly formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh. In the viral photo, Deo, who is much older to Gandhi, is seen bowing to touch his feet.

A Facebook page, 'India against Presstitudes', posted this photograph with a message: ""48-year-old senior blessing his 80-year-old junior. My friend Pappu ji is kind"".

Thousands of people shared this post and hundreds commented on it, attacking Rahul and the Congress culture. Many people even doubted if the picture was photoshopped.

India Today's Fact Check team found that the photograph is real. Chhattisgarh minister TS Singh Deo did indeed bow in front of Rahul.

Other Facebook pages like 'Social Tamasha', 'I support Modi Ji and BJP' also carried this picture with various captions hitting out at the Congress president.

In the photograph, one can see a grey-haired man bowing in front of Rahul. Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is also standing beside Rahul with a bouquet in hand on the red carpet. Senior Congress leader RPN Singh can also be seen in the crowd.

India Today TV spoke to TS Singh Deo to check the claims made on social media regarding the photograph. He confirmed that this is the venue of the swearing-in ceremony on December 17 and he was present there when Rahul Gandhi arrived. However he did not try to touch Rahul's feet and only shook hands. According to him, the photo is morphed.

But at the same time, Deo himself admitted that he has a habit of taking the blessings of senior party leaders by touching their feet on special occasions irrespective of their age.

""On that day too, I touched feet of the guests sitting on the dais after the oath taking,"" said Singh Deo. ""Just after my taking oath as a minister, I even tried to touch Rahul Gandhi's feet on the dais but he stopped me from doing it,"" he added.

Singh Deo indeed touched the feet of the guests on the dais and Rahul Gandhi stopped him; this can be seen in this video.

We could not find any supporting video which would have clearly established the sequence of events captured in the viral photo. But we could also not find any evidence to support the claim of Deo that the picture is morphed.

Moreover, when we pressed upon Deo to describe clearly what had happened at that moment, he gave self-contradictory statements. He even talked about picking up a napkin lying on the floor. But no such napkin is visible in the photo.

Looking closely at the photo, we observed that the shadows were aligned perfectly with the characters, hinting that the image is real.

Rajasthan Patrika, a local newspaper, also carried this viral photo claiming that the minister was actually trying to pick up a thread hanging loosely on the floor from the bouquet in Manmohan Singh's hands. But it can be seen that the thread hanging from the bouquet is nowhere close to the floor. Moreover, Singh Deo is bowing in front of Rahul Gandhi and not Manmohan Singh who is standing few steps away.

We also spoke to Congress leader RPN Singh, who was also present with Rahul. He confirmed that Singh Deo tried to touch Rahul's feet at the entrance but the Congress chief stopped him midway.

A viral photo on social media claims that senior Congress leader TS Singh Deo fell at the feet of Congress President Rahul Gandhi soon after taking oath as a cabinet minister in the newly-formed Congress government in Chhattisgarh.

In the picture, Singh Deo is seen bending near Gandhi's feet as Manmohan Singh and other leaders look on.

The photo has gone viral on several Facebook pages related to the BJP and PM Narendra Modi, with the message ""48 साल का युवा 78 साल के बुजुर्ग को आशीर्वाद देते हुए""

The photo was also shared by several other pages like Post Card Fans, My Prime Minister Modi, Social Tamasha and I Support Modi Ji and BJP.

TRUE OR FALSE?

Well, the claim is false on two points. Firstly, he is not 78 years old, as claimed in the message accompanying the photo. Born in 1952, Singh Deo is currently 67 years old, as recorded in the affidavit filed by him for the state Assembly elections.

Secondly, while the photo certainly seems as though the senior leader was falling at the Congress scion's feet, it apparently was not so.

A senior journalist based out of Raipur, who incidentally was at the oath-talking ceremony, confirmed to The Quint that Singh Deo had not bent down to touch Gandhi's feet. In fact, the story is quite different.

""I was there when this particular incident happened, Singh Deo had bent down not to touch Gandhi's feet, but to pick up a piece of thread that had fallen off the bouquet that Manmohan Singh was carrying. He definitely did not fall at Gandhi's feet.""Senior journalist to The Quint

Rajasthan Patrika, too, carried the viral photo with a small caption explaining the incident.

The daily had also zoomed into the photo to show the piece of thread that had fallen near Gandhi's feet.

BHUPESH BAGHEL SWORN IN AS CM

The new cabinet in Chhattisgarh was sworn in on Monday, 17 December, with Bhupesh Bagehl taking the mantle as chief minister. Senior leaders Tamradhwaj Sahu and TS Singh Deo were sworn in as ministers.

The party has not appointed any deputy chief minister for the state.

The Congress won a two-thirds majority in Chhattisgarh, bagging 68 seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came second with only 15 seats, and Mayawati-Ajit Jogi's JCC+ alliance managed to win in 7 constituencies.

Singh Deo is likely to get the key portfolio of Finance and and Tamradhwaj Sahu either Agriculture or Public Works. The allocation of portfolios in the Bhupesh Baghel Cabinet is expected to be completed by December 24, Congress sources say.

Mr. Baghel is expected to meet Congress president Rahul Gandhi soon to discuss the allocation, said a Congress leader, who did not wish to be identified. Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been in the reckoning for the top job in the State, were sworn in along with Mr. Baghel on Monday.

A day after pictures of the beaming trio holding hands with Mr. Gandhi were broadcast from Raipur, the jockeying for the meaty assignments has begun.

According to party officials, Mr. Deo had made it clear that having missed out on the top post, he should be given the Finance portfolio, which would enable him to influence key policies. The former Leader of the Opposition is considered the brain behind the party's manifesto, or Jan Ghoshna Patra, which promised a farm loan waiver and a minimum support price of ₹2,500 a quintal for paddy.

Mr. Sahu, who belongs to the dominant Sahu community, an OBC caste, could get either Agriculture or the Public Works portfolio, a party leader said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Mr. Sahu, who had earlier been seen by some as a favourite of the party's leaders in Delhi, lost out after Mr. Baghel, Mr. Deo and former Chattisgarh Pradesh Congress Committee chief Charan Das Mahant all opposed his candidature, party leaders said. A miffed Mr. Sahu had walked out of the meeting before being placated by the party leadership, the sources said. The idea of having Mr. Deo and Mr. Sahu share the top job, with each occupying the post for two-and-a-half years, was also briefly considered before being dropped as many felt that it would send out a wrong message, especially after the Congress had won such a decisive mandate.

Within hours of taking the reins on Monday, the Congress government cleared a waiver of farm loans amounting to ₹6,100 crore which would help over 16 lakh farmers. It also announced the promised support price for paddy and a decision to set up a special investigation team to probe the Maoist ambush of 2013 in the Jiram Valley, in which the party's top leaders in the State were all killed."

""Election Commission of India is committed towards inclusion of electoral literacy through the medium of Electoral Literacy Clubs (ELCs) in educational institutions, organisations as well as in rural communities via Chunav Pathshalas,"" he added.

He directed the Chief Education Officer and Principals of various degree colleges of the district to sensitize students regarding addition, deletion, correction and transposition of names in voter lists. He also asked for providing data of students with disabilities studying in higher classes so that required facilities can be provided to them at polling centers.

DEO asked ACD to seek cooperation of newly elected Panchs and Sarpanchs in creating awareness on SSR with respect to 1st January 2019 as qualifying date. He asked the District Youth Services and Sports Department to generate mass awareness on SSR during Khelo India Programmes and other sports activities. He also advised the EROs and AEROs to monitor the disposal of claims on daily basis.

Dy DEO, Chand Kishore Sharma, informed the meeting that ELC is a platform to engage school and college students through interesting activities and hands-on experience to sensitize them on their electoral rights and familiarize them with the electoral process of registration and voting besides developing a culture of electoral participation.

He said that ELCs shall have no association with any political party or political group and none of the ELC activities should involve partisan forces in any form. As far as participation is concerned, students regardless of their political affiliations are free to take part in ELC activities, he added."

After four days of protracted deliberations and brainstorming, Congress president Rahul Gandhi finally took the decision on who the chief minister should be. The announcement was made in Raipur on Sunday afternoon.

Baghel's rise in state politics began almost five years ago, after the top leadership of the Chhattisgarh Congress was wiped out in a Maoist attack at Jhiram Ghati in Bastar on 25 May, 2013.

The Ajit Jogi-led Congress had lost to the BJP in the 2003 Assembly election. Thereafter, the party also lost the elections in 2008 and 2013, which weakened the organisation deeply.

Baghel's first challenge after taking over as Chhattisgarh Congress chief four years ago was to consolidate the faction-ridden party and strengthen it at the grassroots level. It was certainly a tough task, especially when the BJP had been wielding immense power at the Centre and in the state.

After the election results were announced on 11 December, Rahul sought a referendum through an app called 'Shakti' - a unique experiment of sorts in Chhattisgarh. Nearly two lakh party workers, including the newly-elected legislators, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate.

According to sources, Singh Deo was earlier ahead of Baghel in the race for the post of chief minister. However, after a meeting of the Congress' top leadership in Delhi, followed by a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party, the party zeroed in on Baghel's name.

Factors in favour of Baghel

Baghel, the 57-year-old MLA from Patan, was deputy leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh assembly. He belongs to the Kurmi caste, which is considered a backward one. He has served as a minister in both the Digvijay Singh and Ajit Jogi cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh respectively. After he became president of Chhattisgarh Congress in October 2014, he toured the state on foot and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

Even when he was a minister in the Ajit Jogi government, he had been a strong critic of Jogi, and the two never got along well. After Jogi quit the Congress and became its most bitter critic, the party leadership wanted someone to take both Jogi and the ruling Raman Singh government head on. Baghel was believed to be the right choice.

Baghel is known for his aggressive style of leadership, which has also attracted criticism from a section of party workers. However, this warrior-like image helped him to take the party to victory. The Congress got a landslide victory by winning 68 seats in the 90-member Assembly, while the BJP got only 15 seats.

Baghel had been in jail for 14 days on charges of circulating a ""sex CD"" involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government. The BJP claimed that the CD was a fabricated one. However, the issue boomeranged against the saffron party, as the jail term became a factor in favour of Baghel.

While Baghel has been a minister, he also has age on his side. He is younger than Singh Deo and another contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu.

""Baghel's strong anti-establishment image, and his agitations over agrarian issues and rural distress, acted in his favour. He has been vocal against the RSS-BJP combine and has exposed corruption in the Raman Singh government. With strong secular credentials, he led the Congress' fight against the BJP,"" Ruchir Garg, a former senior journalist who joined Chhattisgarh Congress before the polls, told Firstpost.

Garg added, ""As he has strong organisational skills, he consolidated the Congress in Chhattisgarh and acted against anti-party people.""

However, the role of TS Singh Deo in the Congress' performance cannot be undermined. The party's manifesto, considered unique among such documents presented by the party in other states, played a pivotal role in the party's landslide victory.

Singh Deo, 66, popularly known as 'TS Baba"" across the state, was the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, and represents Ambikapur.

According to party sources, Rahul hailed the manifesto as a unique experiment and asked his research and analytics team to study and replicate it for the 2019 general election.

""Prior to the drafting of the manifesto, party leaders went to the masses and understood their hopes and aspirations, before coming out with a list of the ""doable"" promises in their manifesto. This ensured that no section of the society was left uncared for. It also ensured that the chances of the party defaulting on its promises were less,"" Chhattisgarh-based political commentator Parivesh Mishra said.

""Often, the drafting of a party manifesto is given low priority, and is done behind closed doors. Many promises are left unfulfilled. However, the Congress' Vachan Patra this time had short and long-term goals, with deadlines,"" he added.

The third contender, Tamradhwaj Sahu (69), the only Lok Sabha MP from Chhattisgarh, is known as Rahul's Man Friday. However, after the result of the survey of the ""Shakti"" app came out, his name was all but ruled out as a chief minsiterial candidate. According to political analysts, Sahu's candidature for the chief minister's post came up quite late.

In a letter submitted to the district education officer (DEO), Hyderabad, the management stated that the revision has been rolled out keeping with government orders that stipulate schools to adhere by a fixed structure for fee, teachers' salaries and other expenses. Accordingly, the school that was charging kindergarten students ?1.22 lakh per year, will now charge ?57,100 per child. For students in Classes 1 to 4, the revised fee is ?61,600 while for those in Classes 5 to 7 it is ?66,000 per year.

""While we received complaints against four schools, this particular school was found violating norms mentioned in GO Ms No. 1. As per the order, a school should spend at least 50% of the fee on teachers' salaries and 15% on maintenance. However, in this case, the school was spending less than 50% of the fee on teachers and were found allocating more for maintenance,"" said B Venkata Narasamma, DEO, Hyderabad. She said that these discrepancies came to the fore during an enquiry conducted on DPS, Mahendra Hills.

Among other illegalities, the school was also found fleecing students who did not opt for extra-curricular activities. ""If a school is providing activities like swimming, dancing or sports, it cannot add that amount to the fee of all students. The fee should be different for those signing up for them and those who aren't,"" Narasamma added.

Apart from being pulled up by the DEO, the school management also had a case filed against them by activist Vijay Gopal who dragged several schools to the court for charging exorbitant fees.

Speaking about the recent revision, Gopal said: ""Now that the school has accepted its fault, as per rules mentioned in the education act, the management must face a minimum punishment of three years in jail. Also, they must be forced to return the excess fee, to parents, collected over the last decade or so.""

He maintained that the ongoing case will not be dropped just because the school has slashed the fee.

""Once the management of this particular school is awarded jail term, all the other erring schools will fall in line,"" Gopal said, adding, ""if the verdict in the lower court is in favour of the school, I will approach the high court to get justice."""

It was this manifesto, especially the promises relating to farmers, that many believe became a game-changer in the party's bid to dislodge a populist chief minister.

The Congress has not come up with a clear choice yet, even after the referendum party chief Rahul Gandhi had sought on Wednesday through an app called 'Shakti'. A unique experiment of sorts, more than three lakh party workers, including elected Congress candidates, received a pre-recorded call from Rahul seeking their choice for a chief ministerial candidate for Chhattisgarh.

After hectic parleys at Hotel Babylon in state capital Raipur on Wednesday, two names emerged on the basis of the referendum through 'Shakti' and a meeting of the Congress Legislative Party in the presence of central observer and senior Congress leader Mallikarjun Kharge. According to party sources, between former Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly TS Singh Deo and Chhattisgarh Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel, the former is the front-runner for the chief minister's post at present. However, the party hasn't announced the name and is waiting for Rahul to take the final call.

""At our end, we conveyed our decision regarding the chief ministerial candidate. Unlike Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, we don't have a national-level leader for the post, so there's no debate over selection. Now the final decision will be made in Delhi by the party president,"" a Chhattisgarh Congress party source told Firstpost.

File photo of Congress leader TS Singh Deo.

Similar to Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, the supporters of the two contenders for the office of the Chief Minister of Chhattisgarh have now got into clashes over the issue of ""Kaun Banega Mukhyamantri"" (who will be the chief minister).

Outside Baghel's house in Raipur, the Chhattisgarh Congress chief's supporters got into a brawl with Deo's backers on Thursday. Even in Madhya Pradesh capital Bhopal, supporters of Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia gathered at Indira Bhawan -- the Pradesh Congress Committee headquarters -- with large cut-outs and posters, shouting slogans in Scindia's favour and demanding his appointment as the chief minister.

Chhattisgarh is the only state among the three that the Congress won where Rahul used the 'Shakti' app to know party workers' choice of chief minister. Project Shakti is an internal digital platform of the party that aims to link all Congress workers countrywide with party president.

So finally, who is likely to be the Chhattisgarh chief minister? Let's look at the choices.

Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo, popularly known as ""TS Baba"" across the state, is the Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Legislative Assembly, representing the Ambikapur constituency. A scion of the famous Surguja princely state and son of former chief secretary of undivided Madhya Pradesh MS Singh Deo, the 66-year-old exercises strong influence and popularity in Surguja, which attests to the fact that of the eight Assembly seats in the district, the Congress had won seven in the last election.

Pros: TS Singh Deo is suave and articulate. According to sources, most Chhattisgarh Congress party workers favoured his candidature over Baghel's in both the Shakti referendum and at the Congress Legislative Party meeting. Deo was also the brain behind the Chhattisgarh Congress manifesto, which was considered unique among the five manifestos the party released ahead of the Assembly elections.

""During the making of this manifesto, TS Singh Deo extended his reach to beyond Congress workers. He met every section of the society across the state, discussed issues with them, took their feedback and incorporated them in the manifesto. This exercise helped him get connected with as many voters as possible in Chhattisgarh and made him popular simultaneously. This manifesto, which has been hailed as a unique experiment by Rahul Gandhi, proved to be a game-changer in this election,"" political commentator Parivesh Mishra told Firstpost.

Con: His business ties with a big business house can prove to be a handicap, as some party workers pointed out. ""There can be conflict of interest with our party line,"" an elected member said on condition of anonymity.

Bhupesh Baghel, an MLA from Patan, was the deputy Leader of Opposition in the Chhattisgarh Assembly. A backward-class leader (Kurmi), the 57-year-old has served as minister in both Digvijaya Singh and Ajit Jogi's cabinets in undivided Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Active in social reform works, Baghel toured Chhattisgarh on foot before the elections and tried to revive the Congress at the organisational level.

File photo of Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel. PTI

Pros: Baghel virtually revived the party and gave shape to a new Congress after becoming Pradesh Congress Committee chief five years ago. He has strong organisational skills and is a more grassroots party worker in comparison. He actively campaigned across Chhattisgarh this election.

Con: According to insiders, Baghel's leadership style is not acceptable to many workers in the faction-ridden party in the state. His name had emerged in the alleged case of sleaze CDs involving a senior minister in the Raman Singh government ahead of the election. A special CBI court had sent him to 14-day judicial custody in the case.

Two other leaders, Tamradhwaj Sahu and Charandas Mahant, who were earlier in the fray for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's chair, are now apparently out of the race.

A 66-year-old Lok Sabha MP from Durg and a leader of the Sahu community, which has a sizeable presence in Chhattisgarh among Other Backward Classes, Sahu is now a fence-sitter. ""In case the Congress top leadership disagrees on Deo and Baghel, Sahu may become the chief minister. But the chances are bleak,"" a party leader said.

While finalising the candidate for the Chhattisgarh chief minister's post, the party leadership also has to consider who can play a pivotal role in maximising the party's tally in Chhattisgarh and mobilise resources in the run-up to the 2019 general elections. Besides, the party also has to fulfil the promises it made to voters in the state ahead of the polls.

Although it was initially believed that selecting the Chhattisgarh chief minister would be a comparatively easy task for the Congress, unlike in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, it seems that it's going to be another tight-rope walk for Rahul.

""Chhattisgarh has given a thumping majority to the Congress, ending the three-term rule of Bharatiya Janata Party's Dr Raman Singh. Although pollsters had predicted a tight contest, it eventually turned out to be one-sided, with the BJP losing a significant percentage (8%+) of its votes in the state. The 'Third Front', led by Ajit Jogi's Chhattisgarh Janata Congress (JCC) with ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), which was tipped to eat into the Congress vote share, seems to have damaged the prospects of the BJP more than the Congress.

So, how did the Congress win so convincingly in the absence of a wave?"" asks Anand Kochukudy, a Delhi-based political commentator.

Singh Deo","The Hindu",FALSE,"Did the anti-BJP sentiment and not really pro-Congress mood help your party?

This clearly was a vote for the Congress. BJP has been routed because the Congress presented a very acceptable and clear option. The people of Chhattisgarh did not give a negative vote against any party.

Mankind has not only reached the moon and we have gone even beyond. And we have only made practical promises. We are looking at roughly a budget of Rs 1 lakh crore. We will obviously have to look at ways to generate additional revenue, cut expenses and prioritise. It is difficult but doable and will be done.

Obviously, Narendra Modi's magic didn't work, they did not even cross 20 seats. And Raman Singh, nice guy, a smiling face. He had been in power for 15 years and in all these years nothing really stuck to him. There were talks but still nothing stuck to him. But his own victory margin came down. Obviously, they were on a back foot. But such a massive victory, not only in terms of number of MLAs but in amount of vote share shows that it is the people's victory. And that our (Congress) president Rahul Gandhi managed to connect to the people.

In every election in the State the margin between Congress and BJP has never gone above 2 per cent. But at the same time, in Lok Sabha elections, which are usually held 4-6 months after the State Assembly polls, the margin widens. So obviously whichever party wins the State also impacts the Lok Sabha outcome too.

And more importantly, a chain has been formed in the Hindi heartland. Out of 65 seats in three States (Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan) Congress only had five seats here. Even if we were to hand over half of the 65 seats to BJP it will no longer be in majority in the Lok Sabha."

Several exit polls have predicted a neck-and-neck fight between the big two.

Of the 90 Assembly segments, 51 are for the general category while 10 segments are reserved for Scheduled Castes and 29 for Scheduled Tribes.

In the last Assembly polls, the BJP had won 49, the Congress won 39, while one seat each was bagged by the BSP and an Independent.

Edited excerpts:

How do see the 2018 assembly elections? Can your party form the next government?

We are wining this election. Sometimes there is a sense of undercurrent -- where there is a movement towards you -- but I am seeing a wave. There is a great sense of dissatisfaction that has transformed into wave to remove BJP.

Former Congress CM Ajit Jogi has formed the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh and now contesting in an alliance with the Bahujan Samaj Party. What impact will he make?

Jogi was given a golden opportunity by Sonia [Gandhi] ji and the Congress leadership. He had only two MLAs with him when the state was formed. Jogi was seen as a capable person to rule the state, but he lost his chance. He wanted to create his own team, resulting in groupism. This led to the Congress losing the election. We are happy that Jogi is not with the Congress because he was sabotaging the party and helping the BJP.

Do you think Jogi can go with the BJP?

He is with the BJP; he is working for the BJP. But the Congress is getting a clear majority this time.

Who will be the CM if the Congress wins Chhattisgarh?

We have many faces. Two months ago, we met Rahul [Gandhi] ji along with other senior Congress leaders where it was decided that we will fight this election without any face. In Uttar Pradesh, BJP had not projected anyone and bagged 80% seats.

What will be Congress strategy in case we get a hung assembly?

We will certainly not join hands with Ajit Jogi. We will go back to people. If we can't fight an election with him, how can we form a government? We have responsibility towards people ...Coming back is power is not the sole criteria.

It is said that even after being in power for 15 years, Raman Singh is seen a reliable and trusted face. Do you agree?

It may have been so in 2008 but not now because Raman Singh did not fulfil his poll promises. His schemes are not working, electricity situation is bad, and all this has affected his image.

What about the infighting in the state unit of the Congress?

I don't think there is infighting in the Congress in Chhattisgarh. Nobody talks about the infighting in the BJP. Isn't there a fight between Raman Singh and [agriculture minister] Brijmohan Agarwal? Everyone knows who leaked documents showing Agarwal in bad light. And documents regarding scams by Raman Singh are also being leaked. Who is doing it in the BJP?"

MLA from Ambikapur constituency since 2008, Deo is touted as one of the frontrunners to be the chief ministerial picks if Congress comes to power. In a detailed conversation with Parth MN, Deo spoke about the need to improve the standard of living of tribals. He criticised the Raman Singh government for prioritising corporate interests over tribals, alleging that the BJP-led government has neglected their interests, which has resulted in an economic mismatch in Chhattisgarh. Popularly known as TS Baba, Deo, who belongs to the royal family, condemned the arrest of Sudha Bharadwaj, who has lived in Chhattisgarh almost all her life.

Edited excerpts from the interview

If the Congress comes to power in Chhattisgarh, what would be your policy regarding the tribals, who form a major population of the state?

Tribals form about 31 percent of the population in Chhattisgarh. Their population has reduced by 1 percent in the last census. They live mostly in jungle areas, which is less productive as far as the agriculture is concerned. So the main concern for their development is to provide them with means of livelihood other than agriculture.

Which would be?

Their natural habitat is the forest. So, one could be forest produce, two could be tourism, third could be handicrafts, fourth could be their rights in mining areas which they have been denied, and government jobs. The idea is to provide a better standard of living. If you make a road, it is of no consequence unless it improves your standard of living. If you make a school, it is of no use unless it improves the standard of living. It's important for them to make the best of the environment they live in. If you are bringing in industry and it is not providing jobs to them, if you are doing mining activity and they don't have any share of it, it is of no consequence. For example, in Kondagaon, they told me there are around 70,000-80,000 people engaged in cottage industry where they make gun metal statues. I met the workers during the process of making the people's manifesto. And one could see very easily where they are falling behind. There are middlemen who help the tribal with the raw material, and for their profit margins to be higher, they sell the finished good at a price lower than the market price. The tribals complained regarding the handicraft corporation which has been formed. There, too, it is a matter of commission mongering. There is a large market for such products, which are of interest and value to the people within the country and even to export markets. Unfortunately, no government has thought of pushing them in a big way.

You said tribal population has decreased by one percent. What is the reason?

The survey was not done in 100 villages, so it could mean that 500 people in a village on an average, which is 50,000. It is not a small number. Several groups are migrating because of pressure from the Naxals and lack of employment in the state, among other things. Other reason could also be the rise in the number of people coming from outside the state. Reasons behind falling percent in the number of tribals in the state are mostly migration out of tribal areas and migration into Chhattisgarh. There is no proof to conclude that drop in birth rate is the reason.

What are the policies of the Raman Singh government regarding the tribals which you particularly object to?

It is basically neglect. There is a sense of complacency in the current government -- no matter what happens, we win. There is a lot of bureaucracy in the ruling government and Raman Singh is completely dependent on that. So long as they are delivering him a government, election after election, Raman Singh has left Chhattisgarh to be managed by the bureaucrats.

Has the tribal situation worsened in the past 15 years?

Chhattisgarh has the highest percentage of BPL families in the country. At least, 39.93 percent is the reserve bank figure for average BPL families - urban and rural combined - for Chhattisgarh. It is the highest in the country. For a state that is supposed to be developing, something is going wrong. If the per capita income has crossed 90,000 and your family is an average of 4.53. By that calculation a family in Chhattisgarh should earn 4.5 lakh rupees. Tribals aren't earning even close to it. It basically indicates that a few people are earning a lot and the tribals are marginalised. If you are able to project the per capita is increasing, where is the money going?

Tribals are angry with Raman Singh for opening up their forests to the private players. How do you plan to manage them if you come to power?

Whether they are tribals or non-tribals, so long as they are residents of Chhattisgarh, you should target those reserves that displace the least. Secondly, if you are saying that in the next coming years, you are going to change the technology to non-traditional means of production of electricity, that is non-coal based electricity, you are not going to need coal. If you don't need all of this coal, where does it reside? If this coal resides in tribal areas only, then you don't have an option. But if there is coal in non-tribal areas, where the land could be more expensive, then the government is duty bound not to help the industry by getting cheaper land, which is forest and tribal land, in comparison to the land that may be more expensive but lie in non-tribal areas.

How do you plan to correct that?

Don't allot it to them.

Would it be as easy?

Yes, if you have the will. Lemru is an area between Surguja and Korba. It is a forest area of 450 square kilometers. This government had itself projected it as an elephant reserve. The UPA government had approved it. After the approval, Raman Singh government stalled it because they wanted to give it for mining. In our manifesto, we have included that areas like Lemru would be de-reserved for coal block allocation.

When I met the youth in tribal areas, they weren't exactly averse to industries. But they didn't trust the state and corporations coming in and working in their areas. They didn't trust them to provide adequate rehabilitation and compensation policies.

The section of society that is most opposed to land being taken over are the women. They are most opposed to being uprooted. Because, socially, they are the most affected and they are also the most exploited lot -- their lifestyle changes completely. They feel alientated. Then you have the male members, who go by how much will they get and what will they get. Then there is the youth -- after studying and switching over to wearing jeans, how many would like to till the land? They are looking for a different way of life. It is influenced by what they see on TV, or when they go to cities.

Social media has played a role in it?

Yes. The youth is not averse to land being taken. Yet, the rights of the landowners should have priority. The new land acquisition act requires 70-80 percent of the landowners.

But the biggest gripe of tribals is that the Forest Rights Act is not enforced and the consent is often ignored or forged.

We change that by governing better.

After having endured exploitation, there are several people who feel no matter who comes to power, the bureaucracy remains by and large the same.

We would like to believe that we are the kind of team that changes that.

There is an argument that the adivasis are torn between Naxals and police. How do plan to combat it?

When people use force to get power, then people will be seen standing behind whoever is in power and dominant. Historically, entire population never rebels. Eventually, the tendency is to accept whoever is stronger. In the Naxal area, whoever is seen to be stronger, will be able to subdue the population. The question is do people want to be with the Naxals or do they stand with the State? They would just want to be free. They do not like any pressure from anybody in their day to day lives. Basic nature of a tribal is independence. Among the adivasis, discontent begins when they are falsely accused of being Naxals, jailed for three-four years and then let off over lack of evidence.

Secondly, if Naxals or other organisations, that have the means to be dominant in that area, and are able to have their presence felt, why would people be listening to them? Either it is genuine support, where people feel the Constitution is a piece of paper worth nothing. I don't think that's what the people of Chhattisgarh think. Those villagers, who aren't fully educated, don't understand the matters of state or Constitution. It is a matter of making your dominance in an area through the ideology that you purport to believe in, using force to create dominance, and using people either as supporters - genuine or under pressure - or because you want to use them as shields. The informer is the target number one, not the exploiter. Had the exploiter been the target, we would have felt they are ideologically inclined.

You mentioned how the people are jailed and then let off for no proof. Sudha Bharadwaj has lived almost all her life in Chhattisgarh. She is in jail. What do you have to say about her arrest?

I have met her on a number of occasions. And she is a committed lady. Committed to the cause of those in need. She has given up better options in her career. The government does not have proof, and it is just trying to create pressure because somebody doesn't agree with what they are saying. No state organisation can make false charges against people to make their ends meet. She is an honest woman of high morale and ethical values. These are the people we need.

New Delhi: Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo Friday said he strongly opposed criminal defamation and that nobody should be arrested on the basis of what they think.

Deo's comments on free speech come in the backdrop of the arrest of Right-leaning defence analyst Abhijit Iyer-Mitra over a joke by the BJD-led Odisha government.

Speaking about the right to free speech, he said, ""The government has no right to tell us what we should eat, wear or how we should behave in our bedrooms.""

Deo was in conversation with ThePrint's National and Strategic Affairs Editor Jyoti Malhotra at the twelfth edition of Democracy Wall.

Democracy Wall is a monthly free speech campus initiative organised by ThePrint in collaboration with Facebook. The event at Xavier University Bhubaneswar, Odisha, also featured actor Nandita Das, stand-up comedian Rajneesh Kapoor and rap artist Big Deal.

Speaking about the Ram Temple issue in Ayodhya, Deo called the demand baseless and added that if one were to look back at the history of India, even the Aryans would be found to be immigrants.

Deo also encouraged people to look forward and not in the past, adding that a future must be considered for cities instead of renaming them.

Deo called Arvind Kejriwal's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) an interesting experiment which ""has now become very mundane like other political parties"".

""It can only be revived if Kejriwal reinvents himself,"" said Deo.

However, he added that the issue of pollution in Delhi really bothered him, and wondered why the AAP-led state government and the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government are not doing anything about it.

He suggested that pollution in the city could be reduced if all the parties came together and provided Rs 7,000 crore to the farmers of Haryana and Punjab to stop burning crop stubble. He said it worried him that the government has ""Rs 10,000 crore to build statues"" but nothing to deal with the grave issue of pollution.

As the #MeToo movement raged on around the world and in India, the political establishment in the country maintained studious silence. On this, Deo said that politicians are very concerned about their goodwill.

""There are already many people who are waiting for reasons to defame politicians so why would a politician let their reputation to damage,"" he said.

Deo, however, added that he was quite surprised that people in the media kept quiet about the issue of sexual harassment for so long.

Both the BJP and the Congress, in their current avatars, are not suitable enough to run the government, said Deo.

""I think BJP has become increasingly autocratic, it doesn't listen to different voices in India and tries to suppress different voices as they exist today,"" he said.

Even as it battles the ruling BJP's ""poaching prowess"", the Congress veteran and Leader of Opposition T.S. Singh Deo firmly believes Chhattisgarh is all set to end 15 years of the BJP's ""misrule and anti-people"" policies.

Voting in Chhattisgarh will be held in two phases. In the first phase, voting will be held in 18 constituencies in the southern part of the state on November 12, while the second phase of elections will be held on November 20.

""The agrarian crisis, exploitation of tribals and a downward spiraling economy with no jobs are the hallmarks of the Raman Singh government. Reeling under 15-years of misrule, the people, especially farmers and tribals, will vote the Congress to power in the state,"" Singh Deo said in an interview.

Widely considered as one of the party's Chief Ministerial hopefuls, Singh Deo has been leading the Congress campaign in the state that promises complete waiver of farm loans and Rs 2,500 as minimum support price for paddy.

""Under the BJP, Chhattisgarh has consistently been among the top states to account for most number of farm suicides. Annually, more than 1,200 farmers and agriculture labourers end their lives. In fact, the government admitted in Parliament that there have been nearly 2,400 farm suicides between 2014-2016 in the state,"" said Singh Deo, highlighting the deepening crisis in the agriculture sector in the state.

""Its the farmers and tribals who will vote Congress to power,"" said the MLA from Ambikapur.

Notwithstanding Singh Deo's assertions, the Congress is faced with a stiff challenge in the state which, for the first time, will witness a three-way poll battle with arch-rivals Congress and BJP wrestling it out with Mayawati's BSP, which has aligned with the Chhattisgarh Janata Congress of former Chief Minister Ajit Jogi and the CPI.

Still recovering from the snub by Mayawati, the Congress received a jolt when its state working president and prominent tribal face Ramdayal Uike joined the BJP. Soon after Uike switched loyalties, the BJP allegedly approached Chintamani Maharaj, the Congress MLA from Lundra, offering money and a ministerial berth to quit the party.

Since the 2013 Maoist attack that wiped out its top leadership, including then state unit chief Nand Kumar Patel and party veteran Vidya Charan Shukla, the Congress has been facing a leadership crunch that was further compounded in 2016 when Jogi quit to form his own outfit.

Adding to the problems, Congress chief Bhupesh Baghel has been charge-sheeted by the CBI for distributing a pornographic CD allegedly featuring a state minister. He was arrested in September and is now out on bail.

Singh Deo, however, asserted there is no leadership crunch and exuded confidence of the people putting their faith in the Congress.

While the Congress leadership, including President Rahul Gandhi, has refused to read much into Mayawati's alliance with Jogi and the CPI, Singh Deo admitted the BJP's ""poaching prowess"" is a big hurdle.

""The BJP is brazen in using money and muscle power in its bid to decimate the opposition. They have mastered the art of subverting the democratic process. It exposes their political bankruptcy,"" he said, adding that it was good for the Congress to have lost an ""opportunist"" like Uike.

""Going by BJP's way of fighting by by-hook-or-crook, but its the people who would give a befitting reply,"" he said asserting the Congress has been able to reach out to farmers, tribals and the youth who have been the biggest victims of the BJP's ""misrule"".

Asked if the Mayawati-Jogi alliance was a threat to Congress' plans on winning Dalit votes, Singh Deo asserted that both were insignificant players in the state.

""Compared to the Congress securing 40.3 per cent of the vote share and 39 seats in 2013, the BSP got only 4.27 per cent and could win only one seat. Our vote share difference with the BJP (41.04 per cent) was just 0.75 per cent. The people realise that it's only the Congress which is the alternate and they will vote for us. The BSP-Jogi combine is only bidding to hurt our chances,"" he said, asserting that the Congress will come to power with an absolute majority.

Hitting out at the BJP government over the rising Maoist violence, Singh Deo said that bringing the rebels into the mainstream through dialogue and appropriate policies was high on the Congress' agenda.

""Like in other fields, the BJP government has been a complete failure in tackling left- wing extremism. For 15 years, the state has been deprived of any development and even basic amenities like water and roads. Raman Singh is only known for making promises and not fulfilling them. Dialogue with the Maoists and an effective surrender policy will be our way to tackle the issue,"" said Singh Deo.

Polling to the 90-member assembly will be held on November 12 and November 20, with the first phase covering 18 seats, spread across the Maoist-affected districts of Bastar, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma, Kondagaon, Kanker, Narayanpur and Rajnandgaon. The second phase will cover the remaining 72 seats.

The Congress has fielded a mix of youth and experience with prominent faces including Baghel, Singh Deo and senior leader Satyanarayan Sharma.

Among the main candidates in the first phase is Devati Karma, widow of former state minister Mahendra Karma and founder of the controversial anti-Maoist Salwa Judum militia.

Besides reaching out to the people at the grassroots, the Congress is actively running a digital campaign to appeal to both urban and rural voters.

Using social media to reach out to the youth, the party has also been targetting voters in the hinterland, particularity farmers and tribals.

""We have been running a campaign called the '15 saal kayi sawaal' (15 years, many questions) across the state, particularly in rural areas, highlighting how the Raman Singh government has paid only lip-service and all its promises to farmers have remained unfulfilled,"" said Naresh Arora who is spearheading the digital campaign.

""My father and guru, Pt. Rajabhau Deo, was the sculptor of my musical upbringing. He taught me the best aesthetic values of Gwalior, Kirana and Jaipur Gharanas for more than 45 years,"" the vocalist told IANS in an email interview.

""Having your guru as a meticulous father is a matter of advantage, but in this journey my father mostly remained strict. He maintained an excellent balance between my upbringing as a growing child, as a growing student of music, as well as a growing academician,"" she said.

Marulkar, who is also trained in the semi-classical repertoire of the Purab music tradition, also teaches young classical singers in the emotive and fluent styles of Purabi 'thumri' and 'dadra'.

She attributes her association with the Purab genre to her prolonged stays in Varanasi, during which her recitals came to be influenced by this style.

The 67-year-old musician -- entitled ""Gaan Saraswati"" by Chandigarh-based Pracheen Kala Kendra -- feels that newer entrants in the music industry do not tend to be selective about their performances.

""We had a strict discrimination in accepting concerts,"" Marulkar said.

""Now, the number of concerts a performer tends to accept does not allow him to observe himself, self-evaluate his concerts and contemplate on the coming assignments,"" she added.

The Jaipur gharana exponent is also known for her intricate analysis of the 'raags' of Indian classical music.

Along with initiating young singers into music, she demonstrates its subtleties with workshops and lectures in education spaces.

""Music cannot be confined into a syllabus-based teaching plan,"" asserted Marulkar, who says her constant inspirations in her repertoire remain Pt. Siddheshwari Devi, Pt. Girija Devi and Pt. Nirmala Arun.

The musician will be performing the musical forms of 'khayal' and semi-classical compositions at the National Centre for Performing Arts here on Thursday.
