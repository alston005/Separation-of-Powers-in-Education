Deputy Commissioner Srinagar, Dr Syed Abid Rasheed Shah, Friday directed for immediate inspection of private schools across the district to ascertain the complaints of exorbitant pricing of books and uniforms provided to students in schools.

The DC taking a strong note of the complaints directed for joint inspection by concerned executive magistrates of the district and ZEOs from the Education department to inspect schools in all educational zones of the district and submit reports within three days.

Dr Shah said education is a social cause and must not be allowed to be commercialized. He said the district administration will ensure that there is strict adherence to the mechanism in place regulating the pricing of books and other related items and that strict action will be taken against any violations. He said the Private Schools Association of the district has also been taken on board on the issue and that the latter has assured of full support in regard to the matter.

To an unsuspecting class of primary school students, the teacher darts this question. ""Who is the Prime Minister of Cyprus?""

As the children keep mum, the District Educational Officer (DEO) turns to the teacher and the headmaster for an answer, who by now realise their ignorance and begin mumbling. Akbar Kakkattil, who immortalised school teachers in many of his short stories, ends this popular anecdote on school inspection in his book School Diary, saying the DEO too did not know the answer.

This ritualistic approach of fact-finding by the officials, a favourite theme in many Malayalam short stories, is expected to change soon as the Education Department has decided to overhaul the process of inspection of aided and government schools by officials. In a recent circular, the Director of Public Instruction (DPI) has asked Assistant Educational Officers, DEOs, and Deputy Directors of Education to be more self-critical about it.

Reminding teachers that there has been an unprecedented response to the 'Save public education' programme of the government, the DPI says the enrolment in government and aided schools had gone up considerably of late. Now, it is the responsibility of the educational officers and teachers to respond to the trust of parents by ensuring academic excellence. Inspection of schools is the effective way to do this, says the circular.

""There is need to be more serious towards the monitoring of educational activities in schools. The proposal is to put in place a mechanism to review the feedback [from teachers and students] after inspection. If there is proper intervention, the quality of education will improve,"" K.V. Mohan Kumar, DPI, told The Hindu on Monday.

The circular asks educational officers to inspect the schools in their jurisdiction at least once a year compulsorily, apart from conducting an unscheduled visit. For aided schools, managers should be kept in the loop. Pointing out the consecutive reports of the Accountant General citing the ineffective nature of school inspections, the DPI says it is the responsibility of the officers to travel from one school to another.

""The process should not be an error-finding mechanism. The officer should act as a friend of the teachers and non-teachers and help them achieve academic excellence,"" the circular says. They should check if the benefits of government schemes reach the beneficiaries. Whether the schools have adequate infrastructure such as libraries, laboratories and furniture should be examined, it adds."

In the second half, Balodi inspected two more schools in and around Panery and Bhergaon under Bhergaon subdivision of Udalguri district and made a complete supervision of the schools.

C T Murthy, joint commissioner, transport, revealed special squads, led by two deputy transport commissioners, will inspect school vehicles. ""I have instructed the deputy transport commissioners to form squads and launch inspections,"" Murthy said.

M Prabhuswamy, deputy commissioner for transport and senior RTO, Mysuru said a meeting was held on June 16 with all the heads of schools in this regard.

""We had given school managements a deadline of 15 days to follow rules and implements measures,"" he said. ""From July 1, we will launch inspection drives. We have already seized a bus belonging to a private school in Nanjanagud for violating safety norms.""

Welcome move

However parents and school managements feel it is a difficult task to monitor and regulate private vehicles which drop and pick up students. ""Private vehicles are being misused,"" said a school principal. ""This is the reality across the district. Parents opt for private vehicles as the monthly fee is low. In the city also, 10 to 12 children are ferried in a single auto. School managements are helpless, but the transport department and the traffic police can initiate action. If we raise objections, they start a blame game. So the transport department must launch this inspection drive as soon as possible."""

The authorities have given errant institutions 15 days to ensure their vehicles meet the standards.

The lapses were revealed during an inspection conducted by RTO officials on Friday at Maharaja's College Ground. The inspection comes in the wake of several complaints regarding the lack of safety measures in vehicles ferrying children to school.

RTO officials issued notices to educational institutions to attend an awareness programme on road safety and to bring school and college vehicles for inspection. Around 300 vehicles turned up for inspection. The authorities verified vehicles documents, fitness, and safety measures adopted, the details of the drivers and other details which were specified by the Supreme Court Committee on Road Safety.

M Prabhu Swamy, RTO (West), told TOI that of the 300 vehicles, only 30 vehicles were found to have met safety guidelines. ""We conducted thorough inspection of the vehicles and found only 10 per cent, that is only 30 vehicles, had followed all the safety guidelines,"" he said.

Some of the guidelines include horizontal grills on windows, firm door locks, speed governors, GPS tracking and fire extinguishers. The authorities also inspected whether the school vehicle driver had five years of driving experience and wore a uniform and badge.

Swamy said that after the inspection, a checklist was issued to managements of educational institutions. ""After 15 days, institutions should bring their vehicles to the RTO and get their vehicles inspected again. If they are still found violating rules, vehicles will be seized immediately,"" he said.

Swamy warned private unregistered vehicles (vans, cars, autorickshaws etc), which ferry students to educational institutions, that vehicles will be seized if found violating safety rules. ""We will conduct awareness programmes for unregistered vehicles owners also. But during regular inspection, if we find they violate rules, we will seize such vehicles and a case will be filed against the owners."""

All school buses and school vans in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad will have to undergo a safety inspection at the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Pune, which has launched a 're-inspection drive' from June 2 to 18. The 're-inspection' is compulsory for all vehicles, including those with valid fitness certificates. Vehicles that have recently undergone a fitness test or were bought on or after April 1, 2018, are exempt from the inspection.

As part of the drive, about 3,700 school buses registered with Pune RTO will undergo re-inspection between June 2 and 18 at Alandi facility of RTO, Pune.

The decision was taken following the directives of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court regarding safety of children travelling in school buses, vans and autorickshaws.

The school bus transport rules, which came into effect in March 2011, stipulate various regulations on school buses, operators, transport department and school authorities. The rules apply to all vehicles with a seating capacity of more than 12 but do not apply to autorickshaws engaged in ferrying schoolchildren.

""The directives were passed by the High Court in a 2012 case, which has asked RTO officials to make sure that the vehicles involved in transporting schoolchildren follow the rules and regulations issued from time to time. To ensure 100 per cent adherence to the rules, such as installation of speed governor, fire extinguisher, GPS system and driver's licence, etc. We will inspect all the school buses registered with us. Only new buses bought after April 1 and those, which have obtained a fitness certificate post that date, will be exempt,"" said Sanjay Raut, Deputy Regional Transport Officer.

Raut added that to finish re-inspection of all the vehicles, it has been decided that the Alandi testing centre will work on holidays too.

""If a vehicle fails any test or there are lacunae, we will give it the opportunity to fix them,"" said Raut.

Officials said re-inspection was mandatory for both private and school-owned buses, adding that those failing to abide by the rules will not be allowed to operate on city roads.

Raut added that in case there are more than 25 buses at one place, a motor inspector will be appointed to visit the site and inspect the buses there itself.

""The process will be totally free of cost. Vehicle that fulfil school transport rules and regulations will be provided a certificate,"" said Raut.

The Pune School Bus Association said although the move was an unnecessary hassle as the vehicles have to renew fitness certificates every year, the association will not oppose the move as it involves the safety of children.

""The directives have come from the High Court. So let them do it, though we feel it's unncecessary. We are not opposing it since it's for the safety of children...,"" said Rajan Junawane of the association."

With the new academic year just a week away, the Motor Vehicles Department (MVD) has gone into overdrive to complete the inspection of educational institution vehicles and contract carriages engaged in the transportation of students.

While the inspection is already under way, a special inspection clinic for vehicles has been scheduled for this Saturday at Rajagiri School followed by an awareness session for drivers and ayahs engaged in these vehicles.

""Operational condition of speed governors, stocking of first-aid kit and overall mechanical and physical condition of vehicles will be inspected. We plan to check all vehicles deployed for the transportation of students by this month end and those found fit for operations will be issued stickers,"" said Reji P. Varghese, Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer.

According to the data available with MVD, over 1,000 educational institution vehicles have been registered within the Ernakulam RTO limits alone in addition to countless contract carriages roped in both by schools and parents.

Steps will be taken to ensure that only drivers with ten years of experience are behind the wheels of light motor vehicles used to transport students while drivers of heavy vehicles should have a minimum of five years' experience. MVD has issued detailed guidelines to schools and employees of vehicles. For instance, when young children have to cross roads, the ayahs deployed in vehicles should ensure that they safely reach the other side of the road.

Mr. Varghese said that the Deputy Director of Education would issue the guidelines during a meeting to be held with school principals. School authorities are required to keep complete details of contract carriages transporting their students and furnish them to MVD officials on demand. A PTA member of schools should undertake a journey in contract carriages used by students in their schools once in a while and ensure the travel worthiness of the vehicle.

MVD has also warned of stringent action against contract carriages overcrowded with students. Permits of such carriages will be suspended along with licence of drivers concerned, Mr. Varghese said."
