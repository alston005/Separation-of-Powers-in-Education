The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

""Currently, the draft permits only 80 students per class, which we feel needs to be extended to 100. We also demand the formation of a regulatory body - a coaching class council that will have representation of class owners and government"", said Bhuyar.

Another provision that has been criticised is the mandate for all coaching class owners to provide a dedicated parking space. ""Most coaching classes are near the station. There is no need to have a dedicated parking area,"" Karnavat said.

Subhash Joshi, trustee, science parivar group of classes, said, ""The bill should consider the fact that classes thrive because of a competitive market. Excessive restrictions would neither benefit students nor classes"".

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

""My decision will also draw the local administration's attention towards this school. I have already taught in 1996 and will now do so again after a long hiatus.

After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories, highlighted the plight of at least 100 students of this school who come from nearby villages and have to cross a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar to reach school daily, Sharma visited the school on Friday and spoke with the teachers and students.

For these students, who come to school daily from villages covered under three gram panchayats, Bhoj Koti, Rajji Tikri and Thandog, Sharma has directed officers of the district administration and PWD to construct a proper bridge that would allow students to cross the river safely. PWD officials told Newsline that construction of the bridge shall commence by October 15 and it will be completed before next monsoon.

The school also has a number of students who walk long distances daily from village Johrian to reach Koti. For them, Sharma directed the education department to arrange daily transport service. ""During my interaction with the school authorities, I learnt that many students have to walk long distances daily to reach school.

Mahesh after he likened students in private schools to parrots as opposed to their counterparts in government schools, whom he referred to as eagles.

He also compared private school teachers with nuns for their strict enforcement of discipline, which ""kills creativity"".

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning. ""Students in private schools are like parrots and only repeat what you say.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death. There was a violent mob at the school which had illegal firearms and bombs so we don't yet know whose guns killed the two people. Police had not opened fire on the protesters.""

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

Despite the police washing off its hand from the incident, victims' relatives claimed that cops with masked faces had shot the two students with silencer-fitted guns.""My son was supervising construction work at our shop outside our residence when he was shot by a policeman who was wearing blue uniform and had his face covered with a black cloth,"" deceased Tapas Barman's mother said.

On the other hand, deceased Rajesh Sarkar's niece Bhiti Sarkar said that police used silencer-fitted guns 'to silence' his uncle. ""Policemen tore off clothes of girl students and verbally abused them. When my uncle protested against it, they shot at him with a silencer gun,"" she said. Another witness Tumpa Biswas said police had shot at Rajesh from a police vehicle."

Chatterjee criticised the BJP-led central government for trying to ""malign and politicise"" the Army. The BJP said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the central government.

On September 29 in 2016, the Indian Army carried out 'surgical strikes' on seven terrorist launchpads across the LoC as a response to an attack on its base in Uri earlier that month. The Indian Army had said its special forces inflicted ""significant casualties"" on terrorists waiting there to cross onto the Indian territory.

""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using the UGC ahead of elections. It is a matter of shame that they are using the UGC to achieve their political agenda. We won't abide by the directions of UGC,"" Chatterjee said.

The University Grants Commission yesterday directed varsities and higher education institutions across the country to observe September 29 as ""Surgical Strike Day"".

Talk sessions by ex-servicemen about sacrifices by the armed forces, special parades by NCC and visit to exhibitions are among the prescribed events by the University Grants Commission for the celebration.

Chatterjee said, ""We would have understood it had they asked us to observe the day in the name of sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

""The Indian Army has always been kept above politics and controversies. But now we are seeing that the BJP is trying to malign and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

Reacting to the allegations, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the Centre.

""Earlier also, we had seen Bengal government opposing directions by the UGC. This is not new,"" he said."

Speaking of the team which had framed the curriculum for Classes I, VI, IX and XI, Sengottaiyan said the team was headed by M Anandakrishnan, former vice- chancellor of Anna University and former chairman of IIT Kanpur. The team also consisted of 14 educationists,

The minister added that Atal Tinkering Labs would be set up in 500 schools across the state within three months. For this, the state has been working together with the Centre, he said.

""Through these labs, students would get familiar with latest technologies,"" he said."

Devegowda said, ""I had to reply to all his allegations in detail and sent the same to the Chief Minister too. The uniform act for state universities was not implemented, then how can I implement it when the governor rejected it?

It was published by a company over which the government has no control, remarked minister Partha Chatterjee.

Incidentally, on August 20, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien said the book was neither a part of government school curriculum nor was it published by the state.

""The book is not a government publication. It was published by someone who is not even known to us. He (Farhan Akhtar) can lodge a police complaint if he wants,"" Chatterjee told the media on Tuesday evening.

Chairman of the state's syllabus committee, Avik Majumdar had said earlier that the book was not a part of the government school curriculum.

The controversy began on August 19, when Akhtar, who played the legendary athlete in the 2013 biopic 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', tweeted that a still from the film was used in the book instead of Singh's photo.

""Thanks Farhan. Ref the wrong pic of Milkha Singh. Checked with education minister of state. He tells me it isn't a textbook for government schools. Nor is it published by government,"" Derek O'Brien tweeted.

""Appreciate your response. Tagged you since you take education very seriously,"" tweeted Akhtar in response to the MP's response.

Mikha Singh was the first Indian to win an individual athletics gold medal at Commonwealth Games in 1958.

Akhtar described the error as glaring. ""Could you please request the publisher to recall and replace this book? Sincerely,"" Akhtar wrote in the microblogging site tagging the West Bengal education minister.

Chatterjee first reacted by saying the government will take necessary steps after finding out the details.

Incidentally, the biopic on Milkha Singh won National Awards in two categories - Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and Best Choreography."

He also went a step ahead saying that the budget book carrying that announcement made in the budget speech by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, was erroneously printed.

""There is no such proposal before the state primary and secondary education department or before the state government to merge schools with low students enrolment. This was wrongly printed in the budget book,"" he said. He was speaking to reporters after a review meeting of the department. Meanwhile, the minister also blamed the media for the school merger issue. ""This is all a creation by the media and there is no such proposal before us,"" he said.

In the budget presented by Kumaraswamy, over 28,000 government and aided schools having lesser student enrolment -- some in single digits -- were to be merged with other schools within 3 km radius with healthier enrolment figures. The budget presented by the CM clearly said these schools will be merged with 8,000 schools located nearby. However, following opposition from academic, the CM said he will not do it in a hurry.

Meanwhile, the data provided for the budget itself created a controversy wherein it was found that no such information was available with the department and nobody knew how it made its entry into the budget copy. Subsequently, even the principal secretary of the department clarified that the particular paragraph had been misinterpreted in the budget.

MINISTER HAS NO ANSWERS

Although the minister is blaming the media while saying that no such proposal was before the department, one question arises: Why has the department gathered district-wise data of schools having less student enrolment with a list of 14,000 such schools? While on the one hand, the minister says it was wrongly printed in the budget book, he seems to have no clue who gave that data to the Finance Department and to the Chief Minister's Office. Also, no action has been initiated against those officers. Soon after taking charge of the primary and secondary education portfolio, the first thing N Mahesh said was about merging of such schools. This created a controversy and was criticised by academics and other stakeholders. Later, the CM himself had said the proposal has been put off."

Assam Education Minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya today slammed Opposition parties and a section of the media for ""unnecessarily creating controversy"" around the screening of Chalo Jeete Hain, a film based on the childhood of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Guwahati on August 13.

The film, screened at the Sreemanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra Auditorium in the city, was ""open to anyone who wishes to attend"" but Congress leaders claimed that a circular from the Higher Education Department had ordered the principals of all government and provincialised colleges in the Kamrup Metro district to send 30 students to attend the film screening. The circular, according to several media reports, says that the ""student community will be mostly benefitted from viewing this movie.""

Bhattacharya rubbished the existence of any such circular and said that he was open to initiate a probe if he gets a written complaint about any ""over enthusiastic official indeed sending out such an order"". ""As the education minister, I never signed any such order. The film was screened at 5.30 in the evening when all colleges are shut. Which student will be available in college at that time?"" the minister told India Today.

Opposition leaders are, however, not ready to buy his argument. ""This is ridiculous. India is a democratic country. Nobody can be forced to watch a film,"" said former chief minister Tarun Gogoi. All Assam Students Union General Secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi also criticised the alleged circular saying that it was a political gimmick by the BJP to win 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Bhattacharya and many other government dignitaries attended the screening of the film in the jam-packed auditorium. In the 32-minute long film by Marathi filmaker Mangesh Hadawale, the character of the young protagonist Narendra or Naru is fashioned on Modi as a school-going student. A book by Swami Vivekanand, which said that one should live to serve others, impresses him and he dedicated his life towards serving the nation. The boy, the film suggested, was destined to serve the country.

Biren Singh with the representatives of Manipur University Students' Union (MUSU) and Manipur University Teachers' Association (MUTA) had already been held on various occasions, the Government Spokesperson informed.

The Chief Minister along with senior members of the State Government had brought the issue to the highest levels of the Government of India including the Prime Minister, the Union Human Resources Development Minister and other high ranking officials, he added.

Stating that there had been responses from the MHRD in consideration of the demands raised by MUSU and MUTA, Th Radheshyam said that the first response was in the nature of the constitution of a Fact Finding Committee led by a Joint Secretary of UGC vide order dated 12th July, 2018.

The same is now to be headed by a retired acting Chief Justice, he added.

However, the above developments are not fully acceptable to MUSU and MUTA.

They continue to demand that the enquiry should be made under the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 so that the body may function more independently.

They are also demanding that the Vice-Chancellor should be asked to proceed on leave and an in-charge VC be appointed in his place, Shri Radheshyam said.

Maintaining that detailed discussions covering the entire gamut of issues had been conducted on the floor of Manipur Legislative Assembly on July 23, 2018, Th.

Radheshyam recalled that Chief Minister N.

Biren Singh while taking part at the discussion had conveyed the House that the Government has been making serious efforts to resolve the issue.

The Government would still continue to explore to resolve the crisis, he assured.

He informed that about 93 colleges are currently affiliated to Manipur University.

With a total strength of about 82,000 students suggesting that there are about 27,000 students in each year of the three year under graduate degree programme.

Students who passed the 6th semester which may number about 20,000 are expected to seek for higher studies at Manipur University and other universities.

The Manipur University has a strength of about 3000 students which suggest that its intake capacity annually is limited to about 1500 students, he said while adding that the balance of students are expected to seek admissions for further studies in different universities of the country.

Radheshyam said the delay in declaration of the results of students who have taken the 6th semester examination is limiting the option of pursuing higher studies and is expected to create a grave situation in the future management of higher education in the State.

In case, a backlog is created of such huge numbers, it will be critically challenging for the authorities involved in the management of higher education in the future, he added.

The Minister said that the State Government is also taking up step for the initial functioning of Dhanamanjuri University from the current academic year.

He appealed to allow the Dhanamanjuri authority to continue with the admission procedure so that the functioning of the new university is not affected in its very infancy."

In July 2016, Madhya Pradesh became the first state in the country to set up a 'Happiness Department'. Andhra Pradesh formed a similar department in April 2017.

Raising the demand through a non-government resolution in the Bihar legislative council, Purbey said it was a unique proposal hence the state government should consider his demand and create a separate department to ensure well-being of common people.

Attacking the state government for its alleged ""wrong policies"", Purbey said though Bihar currently has a government of 'double engine' and the state government leaves no stone unturned to trumpet its development works, happiness is still missing from the lives of common people.

Referring to data related to happiness index, Purbey, a fourth-term MLC, said Bihar government had no exclusive plan to ensure happiness in the lives of poor people and strongly argued for creation of a 'happiness department' citing examples of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh as well as of a country like Bhutan.

Responding on behalf of the cabinet secretariat department's minister, the state's water resources minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, however, rejected Purbey's demand saying, ""no such proposal is under consideration of the state government.""

""You always remain in mood of happiness. And even today, you are looking very happy. So, why are you asking for a 'happiness department'?"" the minister told Purbey and urged him to withdraw his non-government resolution.

To this, Purbey said he was demanding 'happiness department' not for himself, but in the interest of common people of Bihar. He also refused to withdraw his resolution on the minister's request.

Later, Purbey's resolution was rejected by the upper house through a voice-vote."

Medical education minister Girish Mahajan has agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for another year.

However, Mahajan said that the deans of all the colleges must submit the vacancies at different cadres immediately to the medical education department or these ad hoc promotions will not be continued after one year. ""The department is very keen on stabilizing the staff position across state and hence has sought state government's permission to make regular promotions without the MPSC. But it is bad that the deans of almost 50% of the GMCHs in the state have not sent the vacancies despite repeated reminders. Hence the fault lies with the college administration and not the medical education department,"" he told TOI.

The directorate of medical education and research had issued a letter dated July 11 reverting the ad hoc promotions from Thursday and asking the teachers to join back. But the issue was taken up by the Maharashtra State Medical Teachers Association (MSMTA). The association was planning to meet the authorities to stress that reverting the promotions was not right. But when Mahajan agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for one more year the association welcomed the decision.

The ad hoc promotions were done to ensure enough teachers at all posts during the Medical Council of India (MCI) inspection for an increase in the post graduate (PG) seats across all colleges. Hence it appeared absurd to the teachers to withdraw the promotions after the increase in seats was over.

The MSMTA state secretary Dr Samir Golawar from GMCH Nagpur and the president of GMCH's MSMTA told TOI that he was very happy with the decision. ""How can you revert an ad hoc promotion till a regular promoted person comes on the post. And who will refuse to take the ad hoc promotion since he/she is a getting a rise in salary and a promotion. Otherwise lecturers slog for years together without promotion. I am more delighted to know that the medical education minister is keen on making regular promotions. This will pave way for more regular promotions in the department,"" said Dr Golawar."

An experts' committee formed to prepare the draft Maharashtra Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill has submitted its report to the government and action had begun on it, state Education Minister Vinod Tawde said today.

Tawde made the statement in response to concerns raised by Assembly members, from both the ruling and opposition parties, over private coaching classes allegedly cheating and looting parents of school students as well as candidates appearing for competitive examinations.

The members of the House also questioned poor attendance of students in schools on whose premises integrated coaching classes were being run.

Tawde said biometric attendance systems would be installed in such schools to combat absenteeism.

""The government had formed a committee under the Commissioner (Education) to prepare draft of the Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill on January 4 last year. The committee has submitted its report to the government and action is being taken based on the report,"" Tawde said on the floor of the House.

While the government plans to bring an act to regulate big private coaching classes, Tawde said it would exclude private tutors who teach 25 to 30 students at the household level.

Responding to concerns raised by some members over the killing of a coaching centre head (Avinash Chavan) last month, allegedly out of business rivalry, the minister said arrests have been made in connection with the incident.

""However, no complaint has been received from coaching class owners in Latur regarding extortion money being sought from them,"" Tawde added.

The minister also said that the question papers set for Class X examination would carry more subjective queries than objective ones to tackle instances of high scoring by students.

Settling his daughter in to a college in Pune, Vinod Tawde attended the orientation function like other parents, refusing an invite to the dais

In an era of endless traffic congestion to make way for VIP convoys, giant illegal billboards to hail politicians' birthdays, and myriad other forms of showsha that end up alienating the general public, a minister managed to set an example for his peers last weekend with a little humility.

This was probably the first time in some years that state education minister Vinod Tawde was attending an academic programme, but was not at the dais as the chief guest -- instead, he was sitting amid the audience to watch the event, just like others at the gathering. The unique circumstances came about since Tawde and his wife, Varsha, were present primarily in the role of parents, in Pune to attend the orientation programme at the Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts (SSLA), where their daughter Anvee recently got admission.

To quote the state minister of school education, higher and technical education and culture, he chose to give a hundred per cent as a father that day, and therefore did not step into the shoes of a minister.

The Tawdes arrived in the city on July 13 to drop off Anvee at the hostel of the college she had applied to after Class XII, and were present at the orientation on July 15.

Naturally, Tawde was also invited by the college management to the stage as a respected guest in the course of the function -- but, he made it a point to refuse any special treatment, and preferred to sit in the audience with the other parents. In fact, the politician made this a completely personal visit, refusing to commute in his official minister's car and instead using his own vehicle.

Later, Tawde told Mirror, ""After completing her studies in Mumbai, this is the first time my daughter will be staying on her own in a different city for her education. Like every father, I just wanted to make sure she is safe and secure wherever she stays, so my wife and I came along to settle her down in the hostel. I am a minister by profession, but my child did warn me that I was to keep my designation away for a day to focus on being her father during this orientation programme.""

To settle his daughter in to the Symbiosis Viman Nagar campus last week, Tawde also officially sought permission to remain absent from the ongoing monsoon Assembly session in Nagpur, submitting in a letter to the Speaker that he would not be present on Friday due to his child's admission responsibilities. After he took over as a minister in October 2014, this is the first time Tawde has been absent from any Assembly session.

""I am a minister today, but may not be in the future. I will always be a father, and as one, this is an important phase in my child's life. All these years, we have lived together and at least met at home at the end of the day. Now, she is embarking on a journey away from home, and I wanted to spend some time with her,"" he shared.

Tawde further said that it was wholly his daughter's decision to pursue Liberal Arts, and he was informed about her selection only after she had finalised on her dream. ""I am happy she was selected for the course due to her efforts. We were also considering the Ashoka University, but she was keen on joining Symbiosis,"" he said, adding, ""I had heard Malala Yousafzai father's speak about how he would never cut his daughter's wings, and wanted her to fly. I believe in this philosophy -- my daughter will take her own decisions without my interference, and I will support her completely.""

The keen dad also went a step ahead to acquaint himself with concepts under Liberal Arts, to better understand this comparatively new stream. ""It is a beautiful, off-beat course that gives students a variety of subjects to delve into. I am proud my daughter chose it,"" he said.

Sunday's orientation began with a message from the institute director introducing the programme, followed by a special session for parents with counsellors on 'how to deal with young adults'. The Tawdes were present for every session of the programme, and curious to understand course details.

SSLA director Anita Patankar confirmed that the minister had been an active member of the parental audience. ""We were pleased that the education minister considered our Liberal Arts programme as a valuable one, and enrolled his daughter here. Her parents attended the induction programme like all others, participating in the sessions and workshop. It was a unique experience to have a top politician in the auditorium just being a regular parent, doing what other parents do -- supporting their children,"" she summed up."

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said the government does not want to ""shut the doors of madrasas"", but it wants to open their doors for mainstream education.

Mr Naqvi made the remarks at an event here to distribute certificates to the students who have been successful in a 'Bridge Course', jointly conducted by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and the Jamia Millia Islamia, for school dropouts and those studying in madrasas.

A statement issued by the minister's office quoted him as saying that the government's ""3T"" -- Teacher, Tiffin & Toilet -- formula to bring minority youths into mainstream education has been a tremendous success.

The government does not want to ""shut down the doors of Madrasas"", it only wants to ""open their doors for formal and mainstream education,"" Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying.

He said that steps taken by the Modi government for the educational empowerment of the needy sections of the society, including the minorities, have ensured that the youths belonging to the minority communities are getting better jobs through quality education.

In the past about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all minority communities, including madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with the 'Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet' campaign, Mr Naqvi said.

He said the school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35 per cent due to the educational empowerment programmes of the government.

Mr Naqvi said that during the last four years, 2.66 crore students belonging to the poor and weaker sections among minorities have benefitted from various scholarships.

More than 5.43 lakh youths have been provided employment and employment opportunities through job-oriented skill development schemes, he said.

Mr Naqvi handed out the certificates to the students successful in the bridge course.

The Ministry of Minority Affairs, in collaboration with the Jamia Millia Islamia University, had started the nine-months ""bridge course"" to bring madrasa students and school dropouts into mainstream education system.

This year, a total of 260 students had been trained under the course out of which 182 students successfully completed the course.

Mr Naqvi said the Ministry of Minority Affairs has also started a training programme to link madrasa teachers with the mainstream education system.

Minority Affairs Ministry Secretary A Luikham, Aligarh Muslim University Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor; Chairman Guru Harkishan Public School Society S Manjit Singh GK and representative of Diocese of Delhi-Church of North India Bishop Collin Theodore, were among those present at the event."

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

Though the state Assembly is presently under suspended animation, the governor it would not be dissolved even if Jammu and Kashmir was placed under President's rule in December. This increases the chances of the NC-PDP-Congress alliance forming the next government.

""Currently, the draft permits only 80 students per class, which we feel needs to be extended to 100. We also demand the formation of a regulatory body - a coaching class council that will have representation of class owners and government"", said Bhuyar.

Another provision that has been criticised is the mandate for all coaching class owners to provide a dedicated parking space. ""Most coaching classes are near the station. There is no need to have a dedicated parking area,"" Karnavat said.

Subhash Joshi, trustee, science parivar group of classes, said, ""The bill should consider the fact that classes thrive because of a competitive market. Excessive restrictions would neither benefit students nor classes"".

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

Under fire for attacks on migrants in Gujarat, the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma on Friday described the migrant-labour force as 'brothers' and appealed to the businessmen state to ensure that the state's image of Vibrant Gujarat built by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remain blemish-free.

""Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Gujarat through the Vibrant Gujarat summits have built an image for itself across the globe in the past 15 years.

The minister was speaking in reference to a series of attacks on migrant labourers working in factories in Mehsana, Sabarkantha, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, and Gandhinagar. These attacks have lead to their exodus from the state.

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

""My decision will also draw the local administration's attention towards this school. I have already taught in 1996 and will now do so again after a long hiatus.

After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories, highlighted the plight of at least 100 students of this school who come from nearby villages and have to cross a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar to reach school daily, Sharma visited the school on Friday and spoke with the teachers and students.

For these students, who come to school daily from villages covered under three gram panchayats, Bhoj Koti, Rajji Tikri and Thandog, Sharma has directed officers of the district administration and PWD to construct a proper bridge that would allow students to cross the river safely. PWD officials told Newsline that construction of the bridge shall commence by October 15 and it will be completed before next monsoon.

The school also has a number of students who walk long distances daily from village Johrian to reach Koti. For them, Sharma directed the education department to arrange daily transport service. ""During my interaction with the school authorities, I learnt that many students have to walk long distances daily to reach school. Government will soon begin maxi-cab service for these students,"" Sharma told Newsline.

""The minister has expressed desire to teach students every month. We will be seeking his availability after October 20,"" said P K Jain, principal of the school.

Mahesh after he likened students in private schools to parrots as opposed to their counterparts in government schools, whom he referred to as eagles.

He also compared private school teachers with nuns for their strict enforcement of discipline, which ""kills creativity"".

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning. ""Students in private schools are like parrots and only repeat what you say.

He then went on to question the role of private schools in society, and claimed that they only contribute to the betterment of Switzerland, America, and Russia. ""Government school students, on the other hand, contribute to society by becoming police officials and taking up other jobs in our country,"" Mr. Mahesh said.

He commended government school students for their behaviour, and said they were hundred times more intelligent than those in private schools.

Private school managements have demanded his resignation. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said they condemn the Minister's statement.

""How can the Education Minister make a statement showing private schools in poor light? His understanding of education is very poor and we urge the Chief Minister to change his portfolio as he is unfit to be the Education Minister,"" said Mr. Kumar.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death. There was a violent mob at the school which had illegal firearms and bombs so we don't yet know whose guns killed the two people. Police had not opened fire on the protesters.""

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

Despite the police washing off its hand from the incident, victims' relatives claimed that cops with masked faces had shot the two students with silencer-fitted guns.""My son was supervising construction work at our shop outside our residence when he was shot by a policeman who was wearing blue uniform and had his face covered with a black cloth,"" deceased Tapas Barman's mother said.

On the other hand, deceased Rajesh Sarkar's niece Bhiti Sarkar said that police used silencer-fitted guns 'to silence' his uncle.

Chatterjee criticised the BJP-led central government for trying to ""malign and politicise"" the Army. The BJP said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the central government.

On September 29 in 2016, the Indian Army carried out 'surgical strikes' on seven terrorist launchpads across the LoC as a response to an attack on its base in Uri earlier that month. The Indian Army had said its special forces inflicted ""significant casualties"" on terrorists waiting there to cross onto the Indian territory.

""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using the UGC ahead of elections. It is a matter of shame that they are using the UGC to achieve their political agenda. We won't abide by the directions of UGC,"" Chatterjee said.

The University Grants Commission yesterday directed varsities and higher education institutions across the country to observe September 29 as ""Surgical Strike Day"".

Talk sessions by ex-servicemen about sacrifices by the armed forces, special parades by NCC and visit to exhibitions are among the prescribed events by the University Grants Commission for the celebration.

Chatterjee said, ""We would have understood it had they asked us to observe the day in the name of sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

""The Indian Army has always been kept above politics and controversies. But now we are seeing that the BJP is trying to malign and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

Reacting to the allegations, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the TMC government has made it a practice to oppose each and every decision of the Centre.

""Earlier also, we had seen Bengal government opposing directions by the UGC. This is not new,"" he said."

It was published by a company over which the government has no control, remarked minister Partha Chatterjee.

Incidentally, on August 20, Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien said the book was neither a part of government school curriculum nor was it published by the state.

""The book is not a government publication. It was published by someone who is not even known to us. He (Farhan Akhtar) can lodge a police complaint if he wants,"" Chatterjee told the media on Tuesday evening.

Chairman of the state's syllabus committee, Avik Majumdar had said earlier that the book was not a part of the government school curriculum.

The controversy began on August 19, when Akhtar, who played the legendary athlete in the 2013 biopic 'Bhaag Milkha Bhaag', tweeted that a still from the film was used in the book instead of Singh's photo.

""Thanks Farhan. Ref the wrong pic of Milkha Singh. Checked with education minister of state. He tells me it isn't a textbook for government schools. Nor is it published by government,"" Derek O'Brien tweeted.

""Appreciate your response. Tagged you since you take education very seriously,"" tweeted Akhtar in response to the MP's response.

Mikha Singh was the first Indian to win an individual athletics gold medal at Commonwealth Games in 1958.

Akhtar described the error as glaring. ""Could you please request the publisher to recall and replace this book? Sincerely,"" Akhtar wrote in the microblogging site tagging the West Bengal education minister.

Chatterjee first reacted by saying the government will take necessary steps after finding out the details.

Incidentally, the biopic on Milkha Singh won National Awards in two categories - Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment and Best Choreography."

He also went a step ahead saying that the budget book carrying that announcement made in the budget speech by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, was erroneously printed.

""There is no such proposal before the state primary and secondary education department or before the state government to merge schools with low students enrolment. This was wrongly printed in the budget book,"" he said. He was speaking to reporters after a review meeting of the department. Meanwhile, the minister also blamed the media for the school merger issue. ""This is all a creation by the media and there is no such proposal before us,"" he said.

In the budget presented by Kumaraswamy, over 28,000 government and aided schools having lesser student enrolment -- some in single digits -- were to be merged with other schools within 3 km radius with healthier enrolment figures. The budget presented by the CM clearly said these schools will be merged with 8,000 schools located nearby. However, following opposition from academic, the CM said he will not do it in a hurry.

Meanwhile, the data provided for the budget itself created a controversy wherein it was found that no such information was available with the department and nobody knew how it made its entry into the budget copy. Subsequently, even the principal secretary of the department clarified that the particular paragraph had been misinterpreted in the budget.

MINISTER HAS NO ANSWERS

Although the minister is blaming the media while saying that no such proposal was before the department, one question arises: Why has the department gathered district-wise data of schools having less student enrolment with a list of 14,000 such schools? While on the one hand, the minister says it was wrongly printed in the budget book, he seems to have no clue who gave that data to the Finance Department and to the Chief Minister's Office. Also, no action has been initiated against those officers. Soon after taking charge of the primary and secondary education portfolio, the first thing N Mahesh said was about merging of such schools. This created a controversy and was criticised by academics and other stakeholders. Later, the CM himself had said the proposal has been put off."

Pointing out that KSOU had been re-recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the former Minister said, ""The KSOU is located in his constituency.

""These programmes have been budgeted and there is no reason why there should be a delay in implementing them,"" he added.

Assam Education Minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya today slammed Opposition parties and a section of the media for ""unnecessarily creating controversy"" around the screening of Chalo Jeete Hain, a film based on the childhood of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Guwahati on August 13.

The film, screened at the Sreemanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra Auditorium in the city, was ""open to anyone who wishes to attend"" but Congress leaders claimed that a circular from the Higher Education Department had ordered the principals of all government and provincialised colleges in the Kamrup Metro district to send 30 students to attend the film screening. The circular, according to several media reports, says that the ""student community will be mostly benefitted from viewing this movie.""

Bhattacharya rubbished the existence of any such circular and said that he was open to initiate a probe if he gets a written complaint about any ""over enthusiastic official indeed sending out such an order"". ""As the education minister, I never signed any such order. The film was screened at 5.30 in the evening when all colleges are shut. Which student will be available in college at that time?"" the minister told India Today.

Opposition leaders are, however, not ready to buy his argument. ""This is ridiculous. India is a democratic country. Nobody can be forced to watch a film,"" said former chief minister Tarun Gogoi. All Assam Students Union General Secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi also criticised the alleged circular saying that it was a political gimmick by the BJP to win 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Bhattacharya and many other government dignitaries attended the screening of the film in the jam-packed auditorium. In the 32-minute long film by Marathi filmaker Mangesh Hadawale, the character of the young protagonist Narendra or Naru is fashioned on Modi as a school-going student. A book by Swami Vivekanand, which said that one should live to serve others, impresses him and he dedicated his life towards serving the nation.

He made the appeal while speaking to media persons at a press conference held at his New Secretariat office chamber.

Th. Radheshyam, who is also the Government Spokesperson, urged all the stakeholders to help declaration of results of the 6th semester examination for the sake of the students and their welfare.

The Minister sought people's support, especially, from the parents, teachers and students in this regard.

He also urged the agitating bodies to allow conduct of regular classes in Manipur University, colleges and schools, and also to let the admission procedures begin.

Radheshyam said that the issue relating to the demand for removal of the Vice Chancellor of Manipur University has seriously affected the academic atmosphere of different educational institutions of the State.

In order to sort out the matter, discussions at the level of the Chief Minister Shri N.

Biren Singh with the representatives of Manipur University Students' Union (MUSU) and Manipur University Teachers' Association (MUTA) had already been held on various occasions, the Government Spokesperson informed.

The Chief Minister along with senior members of the State Government had brought the issue to the highest levels of the Government of India including the Prime Minister, the Union Human Resources Development Minister and other high ranking officials, he added.

Stating that there had been responses from the MHRD in consideration of the demands raised by MUSU and MUTA, Th Radheshyam said that the first response was in the nature of the constitution of a Fact Finding Committee led by a Joint Secretary of UGC vide order dated 12th July, 2018.

The same is now to be headed by a retired acting Chief Justice, he added.

However, the above developments are not fully acceptable to MUSU and MUTA.

They continue to demand that the enquiry should be made under the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 so that the body may function more independently.

They are also demanding that the Vice-Chancellor should be asked to proceed on leave and an in-charge VC be appointed in his place, Shri Radheshyam said.

Maintaining that detailed discussions covering the entire gamut of issues had been conducted on the floor of Manipur Legislative Assembly on July 23, 2018, Th.

Radheshyam recalled that Chief Minister N.

Biren Singh while taking part at the discussion had conveyed the House that the Government has been making serious efforts to resolve the issue.

The Government would still continue to explore to resolve the crisis, he assured.

He informed that about 93 colleges are currently affiliated to Manipur University.

With a total strength of about 82,000 students suggesting that there are about 27,000 students in each year of the three year under graduate degree programme.

Students who passed the 6th semester which may number about 20,000 are expected to seek for higher studies at Manipur University and other universities.

The Manipur University has a strength of about 3000 students which suggest that its intake capacity annually is limited to about 1500 students, he said while adding that the balance of students are expected to seek admissions for further studies in different universities of the country.

Radheshyam said the delay in declaration of the results of students who have taken the 6th semester examination is limiting the option of pursuing higher studies and is expected to create a grave situation in the future management of higher education in the State.

In case, a backlog is created of such huge numbers, it will be critically challenging for the authorities involved in the management of higher education in the future, he added.

The Minister said that the State Government is also taking up step for the initial functioning of Dhanamanjuri University from the current academic year.

He appealed to allow the Dhanamanjuri authority to continue with the admission procedure so that the functioning of the new university is not affected in its very infancy."

In July 2016, Madhya Pradesh became the first state in the country to set up a 'Happiness Department'. Andhra Pradesh formed a similar department in April 2017.

Raising the demand through a non-government resolution in the Bihar legislative council, Purbey said it was a unique proposal hence the state government should consider his demand and create a separate department to ensure well-being of common people.

Attacking the state government for its alleged ""wrong policies"", Purbey said though Bihar currently has a government of 'double engine' and the state government leaves no stone unturned to trumpet its development works, happiness is still missing from the lives of common people.

Referring to data related to happiness index, Purbey, a fourth-term MLC, said Bihar government had no exclusive plan to ensure happiness in the lives of poor people and strongly argued for creation of a 'happiness department' citing examples of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh as well as of a country like Bhutan.

Responding on behalf of the cabinet secretariat department's minister, the state's water resources minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, however, rejected Purbey's demand saying, ""no such proposal is under consideration of the state government.""

""You always remain in mood of happiness. And even today, you are looking very happy. So, why are you asking for a 'happiness department'?"" the minister told Purbey and urged him to withdraw his non-government resolution.

To this, Purbey said he was demanding 'happiness department' not for himself, but in the interest of common people of Bihar. He also refused to withdraw his resolution on the minister's request.

Later, Purbey's resolution was rejected by the upper house through a voice-vote."

Medical education minister Girish Mahajan has agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for another year.

However, Mahajan said that the deans of all the colleges must submit the vacancies at different cadres immediately to the medical education department or these ad hoc promotions will not be continued after one year. ""The department is very keen on stabilizing the staff position across state and hence has sought state government's permission to make regular promotions without the MPSC. But it is bad that the deans of almost 50% of the GMCHs in the state have not sent the vacancies despite repeated reminders. Hence the fault lies with the college administration and not the medical education department,"" he told TOI.

The directorate of medical education and research had issued a letter dated July 11 reverting the ad hoc promotions from Thursday and asking the teachers to join back. But the issue was taken up by the Maharashtra State Medical Teachers Association (MSMTA). The association was planning to meet the authorities to stress that reverting the promotions was not right. But when Mahajan agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for one more year the association welcomed the decision.

The ad hoc promotions were done to ensure enough teachers at all posts during the Medical Council of India (MCI) inspection for an increase in the post graduate (PG) seats across all colleges. Hence it appeared absurd to the teachers to withdraw the promotions after the increase in seats was over.

The MSMTA state secretary Dr Samir Golawar from GMCH Nagpur and the president of GMCH's MSMTA told TOI that he was very happy with the decision. ""How can you revert an ad hoc promotion till a regular promoted person comes on the post. And who will refuse to take the ad hoc promotion since he/she is a getting a rise in salary and a promotion. Otherwise lecturers slog for years together without promotion. I am more delighted to know that the medical education minister is keen on making regular promotions. This will pave way for more regular promotions in the department,"" said Dr Golawar."

An experts' committee formed to prepare the draft Maharashtra Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill has submitted its report to the government and action had begun on it, state Education Minister Vinod Tawde said today.

Tawde made the statement in response to concerns raised by Assembly members, from both the ruling and opposition parties, over private coaching classes allegedly cheating and looting parents of school students as well as candidates appearing for competitive examinations.

The members of the House also questioned poor attendance of students in schools on whose premises integrated coaching classes were being run.

Tawde said biometric attendance systems would be installed in such schools to combat absenteeism.

""The government had formed a committee under the Commissioner (Education) to prepare draft of the Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill on January 4 last year. The committee has submitted its report to the government and action is being taken based on the report,"" Tawde said on the floor of the House.

While the government plans to bring an act to regulate big private coaching classes, Tawde said it would exclude private tutors who teach 25 to 30 students at the household level.

Responding to concerns raised by some members over the killing of a coaching centre head (Avinash Chavan) last month, allegedly out of business rivalry, the minister said arrests have been made in connection with the incident.

""However, no complaint has been received from coaching class owners in Latur regarding extortion money being sought from them,"" Tawde added.

The minister also said that the question papers set for Class X examination would carry more subjective queries than objective ones to tackle instances of high scoring by students.

Speaking in the Legislative Council during the Question Hour, Tawde said that the government had restored the standard of Mumbai University which had been plagued with delays in the declaration of exam results of various streams.

He said that, this year, B.Com results had been declared in 27 days, that of Bachelor of Arts in 37 days and of B.Sc in 21 days.

Settling his daughter in to a college in Pune, Vinod Tawde attended the orientation function like other parents, refusing an invite to the dais

In an era of endless traffic congestion to make way for VIP convoys, giant illegal billboards to hail politicians' birthdays, and myriad other forms of showsha that end up alienating the general public, a minister managed to set an example for his peers last weekend with a little humility.

This was probably the first time in some years that state education minister Vinod Tawde was attending an academic programme, but was not at the dais as the chief guest -- instead, he was sitting amid the audience to watch the event, just like others at the gathering. The unique circumstances came about since Tawde and his wife, Varsha, were present primarily in the role of parents, in Pune to attend the orientation programme at the Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts (SSLA), where their daughter Anvee recently got admission.

To quote the state minister of school education, higher and technical education and culture, he chose to give a hundred per cent as a father that day, and therefore did not step into the shoes of a minister.

The Tawdes arrived in the city on July 13 to drop off Anvee at the hostel of the college she had applied to after Class XII, and were present at the orientation on July 15.

Naturally, Tawde was also invited by the college management to the stage as a respected guest in the course of the function -- but, he made it a point to refuse any special treatment, and preferred to sit in the audience with the other parents. In fact, the politician made this a completely personal visit, refusing to commute in his official minister's car and instead using his own vehicle.

Later, Tawde told Mirror, ""After completing her studies in Mumbai, this is the first time my daughter will be staying on her own in a different city for her education. Like every father, I just wanted to make sure she is safe and secure wherever she stays, so my wife and I came along to settle her down in the hostel. I am a minister by profession, but my child did warn me that I was to keep my designation away for a day to focus on being her father during this orientation programme.""

To settle his daughter in to the Symbiosis Viman Nagar campus last week, Tawde also officially sought permission to remain absent from the ongoing monsoon Assembly session in Nagpur, submitting in a letter to the Speaker that he would not be present on Friday due to his child's admission responsibilities. After he took over as a minister in October 2014, this is the first time Tawde has been absent from any Assembly session.

""I am a minister today, but may not be in the future. I will always be a father, and as one, this is an important phase in my child's life. All these years, we have lived together and at least met at home at the end of the day. Now, she is embarking on a journey away from home, and I wanted to spend some time with her,"" he shared.

Tawde further said that it was wholly his daughter's decision to pursue Liberal Arts, and he was informed about her selection only after she had finalised on her dream. ""I am happy she was selected for the course due to her efforts. We were also considering the Ashoka University, but she was keen on joining Symbiosis,"" he said, adding, ""I had heard Malala Yousafzai father's speak about how he would never cut his daughter's wings, and wanted her to fly. I believe in this philosophy -- my daughter will take her own decisions without my interference, and I will support her completely.""

The keen dad also went a step ahead to acquaint himself with concepts under Liberal Arts, to better understand this comparatively new stream. ""It is a beautiful, off-beat course that gives students a variety of subjects to delve into. I am proud my daughter chose it,"" he said.

Sunday's orientation began with a message from the institute director introducing the programme, followed by a special session for parents with counsellors on 'how to deal with young adults'. The Tawdes were present for every session of the programme, and curious to understand course details.

SSLA director Anita Patankar confirmed that the minister had been an active member of the parental audience. ""We were pleased that the education minister considered our Liberal Arts programme as a valuable one, and enrolled his daughter here. Her parents attended the induction programme like all others, participating in the sessions and workshop. It was a unique experience to have a top politician in the auditorium just being a regular parent, doing what other parents do -- supporting their children,"" she summed up."

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said the government does not want to ""shut the doors of madrasas"", but it wants to open their doors for mainstream education.

Mr Naqvi made the remarks at an event here to distribute certificates to the students who have been successful in a 'Bridge Course', jointly conducted by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and the Jamia Millia Islamia, for school dropouts and those studying in madrasas.

A statement issued by the minister's office quoted him as saying that the government's ""3T"" -- Teacher, Tiffin & Toilet -- formula to bring minority youths into mainstream education has been a tremendous success.

The government does not want to ""shut down the doors of Madrasas"", it only wants to ""open their doors for formal and mainstream education,"" Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying.

He said that steps taken by the Modi government for the educational empowerment of the needy sections of the society, including the minorities, have ensured that the youths belonging to the minority communities are getting better jobs through quality education.

In the past about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all minority communities, including madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with the 'Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet' campaign, Mr Naqvi said.

He said the school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35 per cent due to the educational empowerment programmes of the government.

Mr Naqvi said that during the last four years, 2.66 crore students belonging to the poor and weaker sections among minorities have benefitted from various scholarships.

More than 5.43 lakh youths have been provided employment and employment opportunities through job-oriented skill development schemes, he said.

Mr Naqvi handed out the certificates to the students successful in the bridge course.

The Ministry of Minority Affairs, in collaboration with the Jamia Millia Islamia University, had started the nine-months ""bridge course"" to bring madrasa students and school dropouts into mainstream education system.

This year, a total of 260 students had been trained under the course out of which 182 students successfully completed the course.

Mr Naqvi said the Ministry of Minority Affairs has also started a training programme to link madrasa teachers with the mainstream education system.

Minority Affairs Ministry Secretary A Luikham, Aligarh Muslim University Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor; Chairman Guru Harkishan Public School Society S Manjit Singh GK and representative of Diocese of Delhi-Church of North India Bishop Collin Theodore, were among those present at the event."

The agitators of Heramba Chandra College blocked thoroughfares in Golpark area for two consecutive days, demanding immediate relaxation of norms. The protest was also backed by students of Gurudas College and Jaipuria College, who demonstrated outside their campuses. The education minister said the government will not succumb to the pressure tactics of the students. ""Under no circumstances will the administration tolerate such pressure tactics. Many people were inconvenienced as they (students) blocked the roads to get their demands fulfilled. This is unacceptable,"" Chatterjee told reporters on Saturday.

Earlier this year, the CU authorities had asked all affiliated colleges to ensure that only those with a minimum 60 percent attendance would be allowed to sit for semester exams. A list of non-eligible students was recently published at Heramba Chandra College, triggering the agitation. Chatterjee pointed out that the state education department has fixed 60 percent attendance as a criterion to sit for semester exams, even as the UGC suggested 75 percent attendance for higher educational institutions.

""Maybe the agitating students wanted to sit for exams without attending classes or studying,"" he said. Heramba Chandra College Principal Nabanita Chakraborty, who met Chatterjee Saturday morning, said the authorities are planning to reduce the cut-off figure for attendance from 60 percent to 55 percent. Trinamool Congress Chhatra Parishad (TMCP), the students' wing of the ruling party, also appealed to the education minister to find a ""way out of the deadlock"" to restore normalcy in the institutes.

TMCP president Trinankur Bhattacharya, who met the minister at his residence, told reporters that the unit has sought a solution that would be acceptable to all sides. A TMCP source said the union urged Chatterjee to consider relaxation in attendance norm for this year.

The Government of Maharashtra is mulling to make Marathi a compulsory subject in schools for students studying classes one to ten, India Today has reported.

On Tuesday (20 November), Minister for Education Vinod Tawde said that the proposal is being considered by the government.

The minister gave the above reply while addressing a question raised by Shiv Sena MLA Vilas Potnis, claimed the report. He had highlighted that states like Bengal, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Kerala has made it compulsory for the students between Class I and X to learn the local language.

However, the minister later told reporters that the proposal is 'difficult' to implement.

It was reported in 2016 that an earlier proposal of teaching everyone Marathi till class 7 was opposed by certain education institutions in the state. They contended that such a move should not be made mandatory for students coming from other states or outside India. One school also complained that it had found it tough to hire a Marathi teacher.

""Very soon you will get good news,"" Bukhari said, speaking about the alliance.

Kashmir's richest legislator

Bukhari held the post of education minister in the erstwhile Mehbooba Mufti government. In March, he was given the additional charge of the finance ministry, after Haseeb Drabu was axed from the post over his remark that Kashmir was not a political issue.

Earlier, Bukhari held the portfolio of roads and buildings minister during the tenure of Late Mufti Mohammad Sayeed. According to News18, he was the richest candidate in 2014 Assembly election with assets worth Rs 84 crore. The 55-year-old holds a graduate degree in agriculture science from Government Agriculture College in Sopore.

In September 2018, the businessman-turned politician also welcomed the suggestion of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Coordination Committee for a tie-up between NC and PDP for the formation of the new government to defend the Article 35A and to fight communal forces.

When Bukhari was asked on Wednesday if he was in the running for the chief minister's post, he said, ""There is no such thing. The chief minister will be from among the leaders. This issue is not about chief ministership"".

He added that the alliance was being formed to address the Kashmir issue, and to protect the special identity of the state that ""we have in the Constitution of India"". ""As elected representatives, we have to respond to the aspirations of the people and the emerging situation. Article 370 and Article 35A are under attack. This alliance is not being formed for being in power,"" he said.

Though the state Assembly is presently under suspended animation, the governor it would not be dissolved even if Jammu and Kashmir was placed under President's rule in December. This increases the chances of the NC-PDP-Congress alliance forming the next government.

""Currently, the draft permits only 80 students per class, which we feel needs to be extended to 100. We also demand the formation of a regulatory body - a coaching class council that will have representation of class owners and government"", said Bhuyar.

Sachin Karnavat, president, Maharashtra Class Owners Association (MCOA), said the government needs to scrap the provision that requires class owners to give 1% of their profits to the government. ""We already pay 18% GST, along with other taxes. Why should we pay more than that?"" he said.

Another provision that has been criticised is the mandate for all coaching class owners to provide a dedicated parking space. ""Most coaching classes are near the station. There is no need to have a dedicated parking area,"" Karnavat said.

Subhash Joshi, trustee, science parivar group of classes, said, ""The bill should consider the fact that classes thrive because of a competitive market. Excessive restrictions would neither benefit students nor classes"".

In a major blow to state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, the Supreme Court has also refused to entertain his plea seeking rejection of an election petition against him pending before the Gujarat High Court. The minister had moved the apex court against the rejection of his plea by the high court and the division bench of Justice AK Sikri and Justice R Subhash Reddy dismissed it on Monday.

The rejection of Chudasama's plea has paved the way for the hearing of the petition filed against him by his rival and Congress candidate Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the assembly election through unfair means and his election be declared void.

Notably, high court's single judge bench of Justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, had pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried. Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency was held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. It was the contention of Rathod that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots by the returning officer was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He had also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, one Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election. Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instruction of the Election Commission of India is that the postal ballots are to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates."

Amid PROTEST by the regular and contractual teachers of Punjab government schools since October 7, Education Minister O P Soni termed the agitation 'uncalled for'. Teachers, under the banner of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, are protesting against the regularisation of 8,886 contractual teachers of Sarv Siksha Abhiyaan (SSA) and Rashtriya Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyaan (RMSA), due to which they will get a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, the entry-level pay, instead of their present salary of Rs 42,800. Most teachers are on contract for the past 10 years. The minister spoke to The Indian Express, justifying the government decisions.

Teachers across the state, especially in the Chief Minister's home town Patiala, are sitting on dharna since October 7.

Our talks with the teachers are going on and a number of them have gone back to their schools, rather than sitting on dharna. Their fast unto death has also been withdrawn. We took a historic decision by taking 8,886 SSA/RMSA teachers on regular government rolls as they had been demanding it for long. They should be thankful to us for this decision, rather than protesting. Gradually this protest will fizzle out. Already numbers at dharnas are reducing with each passing day. In addition to this, 2,000 teachers have joined work, a few union leaders are not letting the others to join.

Teachers are talking about slash in the salary from Rs 42,800 per month to Rs 15,000 only. Your take on it?

It is not a slash. Rather we have given them an incentive of Rs 4,700. If a teacher joins on regular rolls, the starting salary is Rs 10,300 per month, but we have made it to lump sum Rs 15,000, looking at their work done in the previous years. They were on contract in SSA/RMSA and everything has been done in consultation with the teachers. I am surprised why they are protesting now. The probation period, which is three years, has been reduced to two-and-a-half years for them. Even if a PCS officer joins a government job, his/her starting salary is Rs 15,000 only. They will get all benefits of this job and moreover, it is not a compulsion for them to join at Rs 15,000. They can continue to remain on contract at Rs 42,800. Even in the past, many SSA/RMSA teachers had quit their contractual jobs and joined at Rs 10,300. So why a hue and cry now?

Why over 50 have been transferred to far-off areas?

The teachers, who are not reporting to their schools and participating in union activities, have been clearly told no work, no pay. When they did not relent, our next line of action was immediate transfers of all those who are not taking classes, rather forcing others to join dharnas. They can either be teachers or union leaders. So we have to act strict against the ones who take salary from the government and don't fulfill their duties. If they will not join their new stations, we will think of the next action.

What is the mode of payment to the SSA/RMSA teachers?

The SSA and RMSA are the societies introduced by the Centre, under which 60 per cent of the salary is being funded by the Union government and rest by the state. However, now the Centre has told us that they will pay a lump sum of Rs 15,000 per teacher per month only. Hence it is a huge financial burden on us to contribute the rest. Still, we are not forcing all to join on regular rolls. It is their choice to remain contractual or on regular rolls. After two-and-a-half years, when the probation period will end, the state government will have an additional burden of Rs 400 crore in form of perks to these teachers and we are ready to bear it, however, they also need to get serious and give quality education.

Now teachers are pinning all hopes on November 5 meeting with the CM. Will you be part of it?

I am not aware of any meeting of teachers with the CM.

Teachers say the department is treating them very harshly.

We started with cordial talks and appeals, however, strict action needs to be taken if one flouts rules . Our primary aim is to make teachers available in schools and disciplinary action needs to be taken, if they are not teaching."

Under fire for attacks on migrants in Gujarat, the state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasma on Friday described the migrant-labour force as 'brothers' and appealed to the businessmen state to ensure that the state's image of Vibrant Gujarat built by Prime Minister Narendra Modi should remain blemish-free.

""Under the leadership of Narendra Modi, Gujarat through the Vibrant Gujarat summits have built an image for itself across the globe in the past 15 years.

These attacks have lead to their exodus from the state.

Notably, the minister had moved the court seeking rejection of an election petition filed against him by his rival, and Congress candidate, Ashwin Rathod alleging that Chudasama won the election through unfair means and that his election be declared void.

The single-judge bench of justice Paresh Upadhyay, while rejecting the education minister's plea, pronounced that Rathod's petition cannot be dismissed at the threshold and his contentions against Chudasama's election need to be tried.

Interestingly, the minister had won the election by a wafer-thin margin of 327 votes and that too after the returning officer mysteriously rejected 429 votes through postal ballots, a number greater than the winning margin.

As per the case details, the Assembly elections for the Dholka constituency were held on December 14, 2017, and the results were declared on December 18. Rathod's contention is that the rejection of 429 votes received through postal ballots was illegal and resulted in Chudasama winning the election.

He has also contended that the then deputy collector of Dholka, Gaurang Prajapati, who was supposed to be the returning officer as per his designation, was removed after the election code of conduct was implemented. In place of Prajapati, a Dhavan Jani was posted at Dholka with an aim to increase Chudasama's prospects of winning the election.

Another argument of Rathod was that although the standing instructions of the Election Commission of India are that the postal ballots were to be counted before counting of votes on EVMs, the same was not followed. In fact, the postal ballots were counted only after counting of the EVM votes and after knowing that there was a narrow margin between the two contesting candidates.

After considering the contentions from both the parties, the court pronounced that the election petition of Rathod discloses enough cause of action and meets with all the requirements of the Representation of the People Act. Therefore, the contentions raised require a trial to adjudicate whether the election in question needs to be declared void, the court added."

HARYANA EDUCATION Minister Ram Bilas Sharma will now be teaching at Government Senior Secondary School at Koti village of Morni hills in Panchkula district, once every month. The school is located around 45 kms from Panchkula.

""My decision will also draw the local administration's attention towards this school. I have already taught in 1996 and will now do so again after a long hiatus. In fact, students and teachers of other schools nearby will also feel encouraged when I go to this school in Koti to teach,"" Sharma told Chandigarh Newsline. ""Most probably, I will teach Sanskrit,"" Sharma added. Out of a total 250 students, there are around 150 of classes VI to X who have Sanskrit.

After Chandigarh Newsline, in a series of stories, highlighted the plight of at least 100 students of this school who come from nearby villages and have to cross a 20-foot-high water pipeline over the Ghaggar to reach school daily, Sharma visited the school on Friday and spoke with the teachers and students.

For these students, who come to school daily from villages covered under three gram panchayats, Bhoj Koti, Rajji Tikri and Thandog, Sharma has directed officers of the district administration and PWD to construct a proper bridge that would allow students to cross the river safely. PWD officials told Newsline that construction of the bridge shall commence by October 15 and it will be completed before next monsoon.

The school also has a number of students who walk long distances daily from village Johrian to reach Koti. For them, Sharma directed the education department to arrange daily transport service. ""During my interaction with the school authorities, I learnt that many students have to walk long distances daily to reach school. Government will soon begin maxi-cab service for these students,"" Sharma told Newsline.

""The minister has expressed desire to teach students every month. We will be seeking his availability after October 20,"" said P K Jain, principal of the school.

Mahesh after he likened students in private schools to parrots as opposed to their counterparts in government schools, whom he referred to as eagles.

He also compared private school teachers with nuns for their strict enforcement of discipline, which ""kills creativity"".

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning. ""Students in private schools are like parrots and only repeat what you say. Whereas students in government schools are eagles and make their voice heard,"" he said, and added that government school students even argue with their teachers to get their point across.

He then went on to question the role of private schools in society, and claimed that they only contribute to the betterment of Switzerland, America, and Russia. ""Government school students, on the other hand, contribute to society by becoming police officials and taking up other jobs in our country,"" Mr. Mahesh said.

He commended government school students for their behaviour, and said they were hundred times more intelligent than those in private schools.

Private school managements have demanded his resignation. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said they condemn the Minister's statement.

""How can the Education Minister make a statement showing private schools in poor light? His understanding of education is very poor and we urge the Chief Minister to change his portfolio as he is unfit to be the Education Minister,"" said Mr. Kumar.

He said managements were deeply hurt by his irresponsible statements which amounted to discrimination against their students.

Clearing the confusion over introduction of English in government schools, Mr. Mahesh on Saturday said English would be taught effectively only as a language in 1,000 government schools.

Abysmal results, dip in enrolment, lopsided teacher deployment and frequent protests by teachers - these are not just some of the myriad problems that the school education department in Punjab is grappling with. But they are also symptomatic of a deeper rot in the education system. In an interview to HT, school education minister Om Parkash Soni, a five-time MLA inducted into the cabinet five months ago, was candid in admitting serious deficiencies in the state's school education system and talked about hard steps needed to bring any meaningful change. Excerpts:

What are your focus areas?

In the last 10-12 years, the graph of school education in Punjab has gone down quite a lot. The exam results were 50% to 60% last year. In border areas, these were 20% to 25%. With such poor results, we realised it is time to stem the rot, especially in border districts. And, this has been my first priority in the past five months. When we looked into reasons for such dismal performance, we found teachers were not coming to schools or not paying attention. Another alarming finding was that they had engaged some persons to teach on their behalf or even tied up with fellow teachers to take classes on alternate days. We are making biometric attendance compulsory.

Special teams have been deployed. Another priority is border districts such as Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Amritsar, Ferozepur and Fazilka where we plan to open 100 model schools. Also, 3,500 newly recruited teachers have been given postings there.

Student enrolment in government schools has seen a sharp dip in the last 7-8 years. What are you doing to check this exodus?

If there is no quality education, what will the parents do? They want to give quality education to their children and are sending them to private schools. In government schools, most children are from poor families, be it from the Scheduled Castes or general category, because their parents cannot afford private schools. First, it was terrorism and then successive governments did not pay attention to school education. We need to ensure quality. Only then will children come to our schools.

NCERT had recently conducted an assessment of learning achievement of students of classes 3, 5, 8 & 10 in which Punjab fared badly. How do you plan to change this?

Teacher availability is one part, but that alone will not help. We have started making efforts to improve the quality of education, facilities and infrastructure in schools by ensuring timely delivery of books, regular assessment of leaning achievement, healthy classroom environment, proper sitting arrangements, availability of clean drinking water and good quality midday meal.

About 2,100 schools are being upgraded to 'smart schools' this year at Rs 64 crore and additional classrooms are being constructed in schools. We are also providing free uniform to 14.43 lakh children at Rs 90 crore, setting up solar system in 880 schools, installing RO systems in 1500 schools and giving library books.

The government had made a similar promise to deliver textbooks on time this year, but failed.

I know books could not be delivered on time. After I took over five months ago, we have reviewed the process. Corrective steps are being taken. Textbooks will be delivered one month in advance next year. They will have good quality paper and proper watermarks. No outside books will be allowed.

Class 12 students are still waiting for their history book. Why the expert committee headed by historian Kirpal Singh is taking so long?

As you know, the book was ready, but some political parties raised a ruckus over its contents. The expert committee is reviewing its contents and the syllabus. They gave three chapters which have been put online. The complete book will be ready in the next one-and-a-half months.

There is serious imbalance in teacher deployment with surplus teachers in urban areas and schools in rural and border areas facing a severe shortage.

How serious is the government about teacher rationalisation?

The policy has been approved. We are posting teachers to rural schools and wherever they are fewer in number. It is an ongoing process. As there is shortage, additional recruitment will be done.

The online transfer policy has worked well in several states. Why has Punjab abandoned the policy after it was cleared by the cabinet?

If someone is teaching well and there is no complaint, why shift him or her after a fixed number of years. If a teacher is sent to a school located 100 km away from home, he or she will not work. What is the logic? If one is teaching well, what is the harm if he or she remains there? The department has allowed transfer of differently abled teachers, those suffering from serious ailments, widows or unmarried ones on compassionate grounds. We are trying to fill up all vacant posts. There will be no mass transfer of teachers during the next three years. Frequent transfers disrupt education and teachers are not able to develop connect with children. We are clear on this.

Teachers' unions are demanding regularisation of 27,000 contractual and other temporary teachers. What is stopping the government?

Yes, these unions have been holding protests. In democracy, it is their right to protest. Why disrupt classes and waste time of children? I have told them I will not allow this. We have taken stringent action. I will transfer teachers who disturb education 200 kilometres away.

The government is considering their demands. I am meeting union leaders again two-three days later. If someone talks of dharna, I don't talk to them. As for their demand, the regularisation of services of 8,896 teachers of SSA, RMSA, etc. will be approved shortly.

The department proposes to cut the salary of these teachers to ₹10,300 per month on regularisation from ₹30,000 to ₹35,000 they are currently drawing. This is lower than the minimum wage for semi-skilled labour. Is this fair?

No doubt these teachers have been working for the past 10 years or so, but the government policy is to pay a fixed monthly sum for first three years on regularisation. There are other compulsions too. The government is trying to find a way. We are thinking of giving them an allowance of Rs 5,000 in addition to Rs 10,300 per month.

Chief minister Amarinder Singh is keen on English and foreign languages such as French, Chinese and German in government schools. Any update?

If we don't teach English to our children, they will not be able to compete. We have introduced English as medium of instruction in several schools and expand it. CM is also keen on foreign languages and wants all this to be done quickly. This can't be done in one go. We will do this in stages."

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee on Friday said that educational institutions in West Bengal will not observe Surgical Strike Day on September 29, as directed by University Grants Commission (UGC).

Criticising the Centre's move, the minister said, ""This is an agenda of the BJP and it is trying to push this agenda by using UGC, ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. It is a matter of shame that they are using UGC to spread their political agenda. We would have understood if it had asked us to observe the day to honour sacrifices made by our soldiers. We have full respect for our soldiers and their sacrifices.""

Coming under criticism over the UGC circular, Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar Friday said that it was just an advisory and that nothing was made mandatory.

""The allegations are ridiculous and false because we have not made any compulsions, neither to the institutions nor to the students. We have issued a programme because there was a suggestion from many students and teachers that we need to commemorate second anniversary of the surgical strike. Therefore on 29th of September we have asked the colleges, those who want to do, can arrange a lecture and the lecture by an ex-Army officer who can describe to the students how the country gets defended,"" Javadekar said.

""This information needs to reach students, it's not political,"" he said.

In a letter to vice-chancellors on Wednesday, the UGC suggested that institutions ask students to ""pledge their support"" to the armed forces through letters and cards, which the government will use for publicity.

""All the NCC units will have special parade on that day. That is also good. Where is the politics in it? This is patriotism,"" Javadekar said. ""We never mandate anything, we just suggested. We don't make anything compulsory,"" he added.

Asked why the government did not observe the first anniversary and chose to do so in the second year just ahead of the elections in key states, Javadekar said, ""Every time is good for noble acts.""

The state education minister also slammed the central government for trying to malign the image of the Indian Army. ""The Indian Army has always been above politics and controversies. But now we are witnessing that the BJP is trying to malign its image and politicise the Indian Army. This is not right and we won't support it,"" he said.

BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, ""This is nothing new as we had seen earlier how West Bengal government opposed directions by the UGC. We are not surprised at all.""

Earlier, the state government had criticised Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi for witting a letter to vice-chancellors of state universities advising them to celebrate International Yoga Day on June 21. The state government had defied Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) and UGC circular on the same issue and had asked state-run schools not to observe International Yoga Day. The state education department had organised a separate yoga competition among state-run schools later.

In September last year, the state government had refused to follow MHRD guidelines on how to celebrate Teacher's Day in state-run schools.

""RSS cadres were brought from outside to foment trouble in the school and politicise the unfortunate deaths,"" he said.

However, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied RSS involvement and demanded CBI inquiry into the incident.

Rajesh Sarkar died after being shot at allegedly by police on Thursday while another former student Tapas Barman succumbed to his injuries at North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri on Friday. The school witnessed pitched battles between students and police on Thursday after students protested appointment of Urdu teachers and demanded Science, Computer and Bangla teachers instead.

However, Uttar Dinajpur superintendent of police Sumit Kumar said: ""Seven people have been arrested in connection with the incident of which some are BJP supporters. We have not yet received the post-mortem reports to know the cause of death. There was a violent mob at the school which had illegal firearms and bombs so we don't yet know whose guns killed the two people. Police had not opened fire on the protesters.""

On the other hand, education minister Partha Chatterjee removed district inspector of education Rabindra Kumar Mondal from his post on Friday after the incident and said the education ministry was in the dark over the appointment of Urdu teachers.

""A DI has no rights to appoint teachers on their own. Education ministry was kept in the dark. We had no information about the appointment. We are also scrutinising the role of the school principal who did not seek any permission for appointing new teachers,"" he said.

Despite the police washing off its hand from the incident, victims' relatives claimed that cops with masked faces had shot the two students with silencer-fitted guns.""My son was supervising construction work at our shop outside our residence when he was shot by a policeman who was wearing blue uniform and had his face covered with a black cloth,"" deceased Tapas Barman's mother said.

On the other hand, deceased Rajesh Sarkar's niece Bhiti Sarkar said that police used silencer-fitted guns 'to silence' his uncle. ""Policemen tore off clothes of girl students and verbally abused them. When my uncle protested against it, they shot at him with a silencer gun,"" she said.

Talk sessions by ex-servicemen about sacrifices by the armed forces, special parades by NCC and visit to exhibitions are among the prescribed events by the University Grants Commission for the celebration.

He also went a step ahead saying that the budget book carrying that announcement made in the budget speech by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy, was erroneously printed.

""There is no such proposal before the state primary and secondary education department or before the state government to merge schools with low students enrolment. This was wrongly printed in the budget book,"" he said. He was speaking to reporters after a review meeting of the department. Meanwhile, the minister also blamed the media for the school merger issue. ""This is all a creation by the media and there is no such proposal before us,"" he said.

In the budget presented by Kumaraswamy, over 28,000 government and aided schools having lesser student enrolment -- some in single digits -- were to be merged with other schools within 3 km radius with healthier enrolment figures. The budget presented by the CM clearly said these schools will be merged with 8,000 schools located nearby. However, following opposition from academic, the CM said he will not do it in a hurry.

Meanwhile, the data provided for the budget itself created a controversy wherein it was found that no such information was available with the department and nobody knew how it made its entry into the budget copy. Subsequently, even the principal secretary of the department clarified that the particular paragraph had been misinterpreted in the budget.

MINISTER HAS NO ANSWERS

Although the minister is blaming the media while saying that no such proposal was before the department, one question arises: Why has the department gathered district-wise data of schools having less student enrolment with a list of 14,000 such schools? While on the one hand, the minister says it was wrongly printed in the budget book, he seems to have no clue who gave that data to the Finance Department and to the Chief Minister's Office. Also, no action has been initiated against those officers. Soon after taking charge of the primary and secondary education portfolio, the first thing N Mahesh said was about merging of such schools. This created a controversy and was criticised by academics and other stakeholders. Later, the CM himself had said the proposal has been put off."

Pointing out that KSOU had been re-recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC), the former Minister said, ""The KSOU is located in his constituency.

Assam Education Minister Siddhartha Bhattacharya today slammed Opposition parties and a section of the media for ""unnecessarily creating controversy"" around the screening of Chalo Jeete Hain, a film based on the childhood of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in Guwahati on August 13.

The film, screened at the Sreemanta Sankardeva Kalakshetra Auditorium in the city, was ""open to anyone who wishes to attend"" but Congress leaders claimed that a circular from the Higher Education Department had ordered the principals of all government and provincialised colleges in the Kamrup Metro district to send 30 students to attend the film screening. The circular, according to several media reports, says that the ""student community will be mostly benefitted from viewing this movie.""

Bhattacharya rubbished the existence of any such circular and said that he was open to initiate a probe if he gets a written complaint about any ""over enthusiastic official indeed sending out such an order"". ""As the education minister, I never signed any such order. The film was screened at 5.30 in the evening when all colleges are shut. Which student will be available in college at that time?"" the minister told India Today.

Opposition leaders are, however, not ready to buy his argument. ""This is ridiculous. India is a democratic country. Nobody can be forced to watch a film,"" said former chief minister Tarun Gogoi. All Assam Students Union General Secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi also criticised the alleged circular saying that it was a political gimmick by the BJP to win 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, Bhattacharya and many other government dignitaries attended the screening of the film in the jam-packed auditorium.

He made the appeal while speaking to media persons at a press conference held at his New Secretariat office chamber.

Th. Radheshyam, who is also the Government Spokesperson, urged all the stakeholders to help declaration of results of the 6th semester examination for the sake of the students and their welfare.

The Minister sought people's support, especially, from the parents, teachers and students in this regard.

He also urged the agitating bodies to allow conduct of regular classes in Manipur University, colleges and schools, and also to let the admission procedures begin.

Radheshyam said that the issue relating to the demand for removal of the Vice Chancellor of Manipur University has seriously affected the academic atmosphere of different educational institutions of the State.

In order to sort out the matter, discussions at the level of the Chief Minister Shri N.

Biren Singh with the representatives of Manipur University Students' Union (MUSU) and Manipur University Teachers' Association (MUTA) had already been held on various occasions, the Government Spokesperson informed.

The Chief Minister along with senior members of the State Government had brought the issue to the highest levels of the Government of India including the Prime Minister, the Union Human Resources Development Minister and other high ranking officials, he added.

Stating that there had been responses from the MHRD in consideration of the demands raised by MUSU and MUTA, Th Radheshyam said that the first response was in the nature of the constitution of a Fact Finding Committee led by a Joint Secretary of UGC vide order dated 12th July, 2018.

The same is now to be headed by a retired acting Chief Justice, he added.

However, the above developments are not fully acceptable to MUSU and MUTA.

They continue to demand that the enquiry should be made under the provisions of the Commissions of Inquiry Act, 1952 so that the body may function more independently.

They are also demanding that the Vice-Chancellor should be asked to proceed on leave and an in-charge VC be appointed in his place, Shri Radheshyam said.

Maintaining that detailed discussions covering the entire gamut of issues had been conducted on the floor of Manipur Legislative Assembly on July 23, 2018, Th.

Radheshyam recalled that Chief Minister N.

Biren Singh while taking part at the discussion had conveyed the House that the Government has been making serious efforts to resolve the issue.

The Government would still continue to explore to resolve the crisis, he assured.

He informed that about 93 colleges are currently affiliated to Manipur University.

With a total strength of about 82,000 students suggesting that there are about 27,000 students in each year of the three year under graduate degree programme.

Students who passed the 6th semester which may number about 20,000 are expected to seek for higher studies at Manipur University and other universities.

The Manipur University has a strength of about 3000 students which suggest that its intake capacity annually is limited to about 1500 students, he said while adding that the balance of students are expected to seek admissions for further studies in different universities of the country.

Radheshyam said the delay in declaration of the results of students who have taken the 6th semester examination is limiting the option of pursuing higher studies and is expected to create a grave situation in the future management of higher education in the State.

In case, a backlog is created of such huge numbers, it will be critically challenging for the authorities involved in the management of higher education in the future, he added.

The Minister said that the State Government is also taking up step for the initial functioning of Dhanamanjuri University from the current academic year.

He appealed to allow the Dhanamanjuri authority to continue with the admission procedure so that the functioning of the new university is not affected in its very infancy."

In July 2016, Madhya Pradesh became the first state in the country to set up a 'Happiness Department'. Andhra Pradesh formed a similar department in April 2017.

Raising the demand through a non-government resolution in the Bihar legislative council, Purbey said it was a unique proposal hence the state government should consider his demand and create a separate department to ensure well-being of common people.

Attacking the state government for its alleged ""wrong policies"", Purbey said though Bihar currently has a government of 'double engine' and the state government leaves no stone unturned to trumpet its development works, happiness is still missing from the lives of common people.

Referring to data related to happiness index, Purbey, a fourth-term MLC, said Bihar government had no exclusive plan to ensure happiness in the lives of poor people and strongly argued for creation of a 'happiness department' citing examples of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh as well as of a country like Bhutan.

Responding on behalf of the cabinet secretariat department's minister, the state's water resources minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lalan Singh, however, rejected Purbey's demand saying, ""no such proposal is under consideration of the state government.""

""You always remain in mood of happiness. And even today, you are looking very happy. So, why are you asking for a 'happiness department'?"" the minister told Purbey and urged him to withdraw his non-government resolution.

To this, Purbey said he was demanding 'happiness department' not for himself, but in the interest of common people of Bihar. He also refused to withdraw his resolution on the minister's request.

Later, Purbey's resolution was rejected by the upper house through a voice-vote."

Medical education minister Girish Mahajan has agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for another year.

However, Mahajan said that the deans of all the colleges must submit the vacancies at different cadres immediately to the medical education department or these ad hoc promotions will not be continued after one year. ""The department is very keen on stabilizing the staff position across state and hence has sought state government's permission to make regular promotions without the MPSC. But it is bad that the deans of almost 50% of the GMCHs in the state have not sent the vacancies despite repeated reminders. Hence the fault lies with the college administration and not the medical education department,"" he told TOI.

The directorate of medical education and research had issued a letter dated July 11 reverting the ad hoc promotions from Thursday and asking the teachers to join back. But the issue was taken up by the Maharashtra State Medical Teachers Association (MSMTA). The association was planning to meet the authorities to stress that reverting the promotions was not right. But when Mahajan agreed to continue the ad hoc promotions for one more year the association welcomed the decision.

The ad hoc promotions were done to ensure enough teachers at all posts during the Medical Council of India (MCI) inspection for an increase in the post graduate (PG) seats across all colleges. Hence it appeared absurd to the teachers to withdraw the promotions after the increase in seats was over.

The MSMTA state secretary Dr Samir Golawar from GMCH Nagpur and the president of GMCH's MSMTA told TOI that he was very happy with the decision. ""How can you revert an ad hoc promotion till a regular promoted person comes on the post. And who will refuse to take the ad hoc promotion since he/she is a getting a rise in salary and a promotion. Otherwise lecturers slog for years together without promotion. I am more delighted to know that the medical education minister is keen on making regular promotions. This will pave way for more regular promotions in the department,"" said Dr Golawar."

An experts' committee formed to prepare the draft Maharashtra Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill has submitted its report to the government and action had begun on it, state Education Minister Vinod Tawde said today.

Tawde made the statement in response to concerns raised by Assembly members, from both the ruling and opposition parties, over private coaching classes allegedly cheating and looting parents of school students as well as candidates appearing for competitive examinations.

The members of the House also questioned poor attendance of students in schools on whose premises integrated coaching classes were being run.

Tawde said biometric attendance systems would be installed in such schools to combat absenteeism.

""The government had formed a committee under the Commissioner (Education) to prepare draft of the Private Coaching Classes Regulatory Bill on January 4 last year. The committee has submitted its report to the government and action is being taken based on the report,"" Tawde said on the floor of the House.

While the government plans to bring an act to regulate big private coaching classes, Tawde said it would exclude private tutors who teach 25 to 30 students at the household level.

Responding to concerns raised by some members over the killing of a coaching centre head (Avinash Chavan) last month, allegedly out of business rivalry, the minister said arrests have been made in connection with the incident.

""However, no complaint has been received from coaching class owners in Latur regarding extortion money being sought from them,"" Tawde added.

The minister also said that the question papers set for Class X examination would carry more subjective queries than objective ones to tackle instances of high scoring by students.

Speaking in the Legislative Council during the Question Hour, Tawde said that the government had restored the standard of Mumbai University which had been plagued with delays in the declaration of exam results of various streams.

He said that, this year, B.Com results had been declared in 27 days, that of Bachelor of Arts in 37 days and of B.Sc in 21 days.

""I appreciate the efforts of Mumbai Vice Chancellor Dr Suhas Pednekar and his team for announcing the results within 27, 37 and 21 days,"" said Tawde.""The standard of Mumbai University is back to where it was and its glory will increase further,"" Tawde told the Council."

Settling his daughter in to a college in Pune, Vinod Tawde attended the orientation function like other parents, refusing an invite to the dais

In an era of endless traffic congestion to make way for VIP convoys, giant illegal billboards to hail politicians' birthdays, and myriad other forms of showsha that end up alienating the general public, a minister managed to set an example for his peers last weekend with a little humility.

This was probably the first time in some years that state education minister Vinod Tawde was attending an academic programme, but was not at the dais as the chief guest -- instead, he was sitting amid the audience to watch the event, just like others at the gathering. The unique circumstances came about since Tawde and his wife, Varsha, were present primarily in the role of parents, in Pune to attend the orientation programme at the Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts (SSLA), where their daughter Anvee recently got admission.

To quote the state minister of school education, higher and technical education and culture, he chose to give a hundred per cent as a father that day, and therefore did not step into the shoes of a minister.

The Tawdes arrived in the city on July 13 to drop off Anvee at the hostel of the college she had applied to after Class XII, and were present at the orientation on July 15.

Naturally, Tawde was also invited by the college management to the stage as a respected guest in the course of the function -- but, he made it a point to refuse any special treatment, and preferred to sit in the audience with the other parents. In fact, the politician made this a completely personal visit, refusing to commute in his official minister's car and instead using his own vehicle.

Later, Tawde told Mirror, ""After completing her studies in Mumbai, this is the first time my daughter will be staying on her own in a different city for her education. Like every father, I just wanted to make sure she is safe and secure wherever she stays, so my wife and I came along to settle her down in the hostel. I am a minister by profession, but my child did warn me that I was to keep my designation away for a day to focus on being her father during this orientation programme.""

To settle his daughter in to the Symbiosis Viman Nagar campus last week, Tawde also officially sought permission to remain absent from the ongoing monsoon Assembly session in Nagpur, submitting in a letter to the Speaker that he would not be present on Friday due to his child's admission responsibilities. After he took over as a minister in October 2014, this is the first time Tawde has been absent from any Assembly session.

""I am a minister today, but may not be in the future. I will always be a father, and as one, this is an important phase in my child's life. All these years, we have lived together and at least met at home at the end of the day. Now, she is embarking on a journey away from home, and I wanted to spend some time with her,"" he shared.

Tawde further said that it was wholly his daughter's decision to pursue Liberal Arts, and he was informed about her selection only after she had finalised on her dream. ""I am happy she was selected for the course due to her efforts. We were also considering the Ashoka University, but she was keen on joining Symbiosis,"" he said, adding, ""I had heard Malala Yousafzai father's speak about how he would never cut his daughter's wings, and wanted her to fly. I believe in this philosophy -- my daughter will take her own decisions without my interference, and I will support her completely.""

The keen dad also went a step ahead to acquaint himself with concepts under Liberal Arts, to better understand this comparatively new stream. ""It is a beautiful, off-beat course that gives students a variety of subjects to delve into. I am proud my daughter chose it,"" he said.

Sunday's orientation began with a message from the institute director introducing the programme, followed by a special session for parents with counsellors on 'how to deal with young adults'. The Tawdes were present for every session of the programme, and curious to understand course details.

SSLA director Anita Patankar confirmed that the minister had been an active member of the parental audience. ""We were pleased that the education minister considered our Liberal Arts programme as a valuable one, and enrolled his daughter here. Her parents attended the induction programme like all others, participating in the sessions and workshop. It was a unique experience to have a top politician in the auditorium just being a regular parent, doing what other parents do -- supporting their children,"" she summed up."

Minority Affairs Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi on Saturday said the government does not want to ""shut the doors of madrasas"", but it wants to open their doors for mainstream education.

Mr Naqvi made the remarks at an event here to distribute certificates to the students who have been successful in a 'Bridge Course', jointly conducted by the Ministry of Minority Affairs and the Jamia Millia Islamia, for school dropouts and those studying in madrasas.

A statement issued by the minister's office quoted him as saying that the government's ""3T"" -- Teacher, Tiffin & Toilet -- formula to bring minority youths into mainstream education has been a tremendous success.

The government does not want to ""shut down the doors of Madrasas"", it only wants to ""open their doors for formal and mainstream education,"" Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying.

He said that steps taken by the Modi government for the educational empowerment of the needy sections of the society, including the minorities, have ensured that the youths belonging to the minority communities are getting better jobs through quality education.

In the past about one year, thousands of educational institutions of all minority communities, including madarsas, have been included in the mainstream education system by connecting them with the 'Teacher, Tiffin, Toilet' campaign, Mr Naqvi said.

He said the school dropout rate among Muslim girls, which was earlier more than 70 per cent, has now been reduced to about 35 per cent due to the educational empowerment programmes of the government.

Mr Naqvi said that during the last four years, 2.66 crore students belonging to the poor and weaker sections among minorities have benefitted from various scholarships.

More than 5.43 lakh youths have been provided employment and employment opportunities through job-oriented skill development schemes, he said.

Mr Naqvi handed out the certificates to the students successful in the bridge course.

The Ministry of Minority Affairs, in collaboration with the Jamia Millia Islamia University, had started the nine-months ""bridge course"" to bring madrasa students and school dropouts into mainstream education system.

This year, a total of 260 students had been trained under the course out of which 182 students successfully completed the course.

Mr Naqvi said the Ministry of Minority Affairs has also started a training programme to link madrasa teachers with the mainstream education system.

Minority Affairs Ministry Secretary A Luikham, Aligarh Muslim University Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor; Chairman Guru Harkishan Public School Society S Manjit Singh GK and representative of Diocese of Delhi-Church of North India Bishop Collin Theodore, were among those present at the event."
