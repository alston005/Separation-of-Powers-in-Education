The decision comes after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had issued directions to the schools to roll back their 'arbitrary' fee hike after receiving complaints.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia plans to hold a meeting with representatives of the schools that have rolled back their hikes in fees, and brainstorm on ideas related to the education sector.

According to officials, the education department had sent notices to 195 private schools over the fee hike on the directions of the chief minister. Around 2 lakh children study in the 128 schools that decided to comply with the order and rolled back their raised fees.

However, a few schools (of the ones that had complied) that TOI spoke to claimed there had been no fee hike at their end in the first place.

Schools: Fee hike linked to rising costs

Claiming that fees had not been raised, one principal said for most schools that are on DDA land with a lease-rider, a fee hike proposal needs to be sent to the directorate of education, complete with audit reports and expense details. This was done for the 2017-18 session too, the principal said.

The directorate of education, after scrutinising the details of the proposals, communicates to the school whether it can increase its fee or not. The school acts accordingly, the principal said.

Several schools said a fee hike is usually proposed keeping in mind the annual increase in the cost of electricity and water.

The principals also clarified that proposals for 2018-19 have not been filed yet as the DoE portal, where details are furnished, has not gone online for this session yet.

Government sources, however, disagreed.

They said that while the schools do submit their proposals to the DoE, they also simultaneously increase their. That is when parents file complaints with the government or the DoE.

Following these complaints, notices are sent to the schools to roll back their fees, which is when they adjust the excess fees over the next few months, the sources added."

Currently, school managements require only PTA'S approval to hike fees, but this is often seen to be a mere formality. The amendment proposes that schools get 76% of the parents to sign off on the plan. Previou-sly, the state had proposed that parents would be able to approach the divisional fee review committee against a hike if they have the backing of 25% of the total parent strength. But the move was perceived to be impractical, given the difficulties involved in mobilizing support among parents in such large numbers. Putting the onus on the school to seek parents' approval may act as a better safeguard against profiteering.

Maharashtra, unlike states like Tamil Nadu, doesn't have a committee which fixes fees for schools. The fee review committees at the district level only hear complaints from schools and parents if the difference in the proposed and acceptable fees is over 15%.

But a former member of a school's PTA executive body said the 76% rule is likely to work against parents. ""The PTA committee is elected by parents and designated with the responsibility to understand the calculations behind a proposed hike. But when we fight fee hikes, we find support in only a handful of parents,"" said the parent.

The 11-page amendment has also proposed that schools be allowed to charge an interest in case of non-payment of fees. While the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, has no mention of charging late fee or fine in case of non-payment, schools were expected to follow the old rule, which allowed them to charge Re 1 per day.

""Schools can collect fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. If a parent wants to pay for six months or annually, they must be allowed to do so and a discount could be given for the same,"" stated the draft. But if a parent does not pay fees in time, the school would be authorized to charge an interest on the late fee. The interest will be decided by the state.

The draft also proposed reducing the number of posts held by parents by one. Parents rued that all amendments favoured school managements. ""Our representation is being reduced, interest has been introduced and fine amount for schools has been reduced,"" said a parent. School education minister Vinod Tawde did not respond to TOI's queries on the draft."

Bringing relief to parents beset by frequent and arbitrary increases in school fees, a government commission is likely to suggest a 10% yearly cap on the fee hike permissible by private, unaided schools, with provisions for penalties in case of violations, two officials familiar with the development said.

The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) , a statutory body, is in the process of making a recommendation to that effect to the human resource development (HRD) ministry, the officials said on condition of anonymity.

Although fixing school fees is the domain of state governments, in the absence of a standard fee policy for unaided schools, there has been a growing clamour for central regulations.

India has 3,50,000 private, unaided schools -- 24% of all schools -- where 75 million children, or 38% of all students, study. Such schools do not receive any grant from the government and have to generate their own revenue for sustenance.

Many cities across India have of late seen parents protest arbitrary fee hikes by such schools. In Delhi and Mumbai, for instance, the fee hike in private, unaided schools in last year varied between 10 % and 40 %.

Inundated with complaints from parents, NCPCR, the country's apex child rights body, has drafted regulations to put in place a uniform fee framework for unaided private schools. It will propose setting up a district fee regulatory authority in states to monitor school fee increases.

The draft regulations will also suggest a formula for determining fees, based on a school's location, costs incurred, revenue earned, student strength, and other parameters. ""We will send the draft regulation to HRD ministry shortly for action,"" said a senior NCPCR official.

According to the draft regulations, if a school violates the norms provided in the uniform fee framework, it will be fined 1% of the revenue it generates in the first instance, which will increase to 2 % and 5% for a second and third violation. For any subsequent violation, NCPCR has proposed that the school be put in a ""no admission category"" and barred from admitting new students.

""Instead of closing the school, which jeopardises the schooling of existing students, we have proposed that no fresh admission should be allowed in the school. This will allow the existing students to complete their education,"" said a second NCPCR official involved in drafting the regulations.

The regulation of education-related matters is the domain of the HRD ministry, but NCPCR has stepped in to draft the proposed fee regulations for unaided schools, citing Section 13 of the Commission for Protection of Child Rights (CPCR) Act, 2005 and Section 32 of Right to Education (RTE) Act, which gives NCPCR the authority to review safeguards under the law to protect of child rights and recommend measures.

Vimla Ramachandran, a professor at the National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been working on elementary education, said that a central regulation to check arbitrary fee hikes will be a welcome move although she has doubts whether one will be passed . ""The private school lobby is very strong and will not allow it to go through,"" she said.

But Avinash Chandra, member of National Independent Schools Alliance, a national federation of private unaided school associations from across India said that if NCPCR has proposed a fee framework they should also look at how much government is spending in their own schools. ""Its not practical. Private schools don't get any aid from government and need to raise their own revenue. We have to spend on ugrading the school infrastructure from time to time. We also have to give good salary package to teachers.""

In the last few years, states such as Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab and more recently Uttar Pradesh have framed laws to regulate fees charged by private, unaided schools. Delhi passed a bill to regulate fee hike in such schools way back in 2015 but it is yet to be become an Act after the Centre objected to some of its provisions.

But lax monitoring has resulted in unaided schools continuing with arbitrary fee hikes. ""The fee structure also varies. A central regulation will go a long way in bringing uniformity in fee structure of such schools and can also result in strict enforcement,"" the first official cited above said.

""Every year, the school increases the fee by 15 %. This year, apart from the fee hike they have taken development charge also but hardly any facilities have been added in the school..,"" said Pramod Lohia, a Delhi parent whose two children study in a Delhi school."

The Tirupathi Rao Committee, in its report sumbitted to the government in December 2017, had recommended an annual fee hike of 10 per cent for all schools.

""After holding series of discussions, we decided to not allow any increase or decrease in the fee structure. The number of schools that will have to appear before the district fee regulatory committees will be based on the percentage of annual fee hike. Schools that have enhanced it by more than 10 per cent in the last two years will have to appear before the committees. Schools that have increased their fee by less than 10 per cent every year will be excluded from this process,"" Tirupathi Rao, chairman of the committee told TOI.

The Rao committee was constituted by the state government in March last year to examine if private schools were involved in profiteering as the government norms do permit schools to make over five per cent of annual profit. The committee submitted its final report in December, 2017 after a series of extensions spanning 10 months. The government had granted furtheran extention of three months which concluded on June 19, following protests by parents on the recommendation allowing private unaided schools an annual 10 per cent hike. The government sought clarification from the committee over it's rationale behind the recommendation.

While there are 12,000 schools in Hyderabad district alone, committee members claim that ratifying all will be cumbersome. ""Initially, all schools will have to submit their audited accounts for the past two years on the website launched by the school education department. A database will be developed and will be with the government. So far, only 4,500 schools have submitted their audited accounts based on which we will examine the fee issue,"" said Rao.

The committee is also planning to decide a cut-off on percentage of fee hike based on the annual pay revision. However, the modalities into the same are yet to be decided.

Apart from this, the committee has also developed a provision through which parents will be able to raise complaints against schools charging excess fee under various heads. ""Once we have the database on the fee structures, such complaints can be looked into with a click. On par with the Telangana Admission and Fee Regulatory Committee, grievances related to school fee can also be probed,"" said Rao, adding that the recommendations of the committee can only be implemented once the government authorities agree upon it."

Most of the city's prominent schools have gone in for a moderate 5% to 12% hike in tuition fees for the coming academic year, with many of them admitting that they ""kept in consideration"" the state government's nudge to restrict hikes to ""manageable levels"".

Several leading schools said they didn't have to incur substantial additional expenditure on beefing-up security on their campuses since measures had been taken in phases easing the financial burden.

Old schools like St Xavier's, Birla High, Don Bosco and Modern High as well as the new-age ones like New Town School, Calcutta Public School and The Heritage have stuck to the unofficial ceiling hinted at by the CM at a meeting with school representatives last year.

CM Mamata Banerjee along with education minister Partha Chatterjee had met principals and administrators along with management members of all city-based private schools at the Town Hall in May last year. A fee regulation committee had been set up by the CM which had representatives from several government and private schools.

The objective of the committee was to draw up a feeband for schools and the maximum fee hike which is acceptable, after taking into account various aspects including facilities and students strength. However, despite three meetings and drafting a proposal, a decision is yet to be arrived at.

Decision on school fee policy soon, says Partha

Anindita Mazumdar, mother of a CBSEschoolstudent in Salt Lake, said, ""The average school fee hike is 10%-15%every year. If theschools consider the government's point of view, it will put lesser burden on parents. Nonetheless, we are waiting for the government to roll out a school fee policy.""

""We will soon take a decision on school fee after discussing with the CM. However, all schools have been requested not to hike fee which is unacceptable to parents and students. A detailed fee-band will soon be set,"" minister Partha Chatterjee said.

The principal of an English-medium school said there was 'little scope' for a steep hike after the CM's diktat. At Birla High School, the hike this year is 10%. ""A steeper hike was not necessary as we have not

had to spend anything additional for security. We already had 350 CCTV cameras,"" said school director Mukta Nain. Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, too, has gone for an identical hike.

The Heritage, however, has chosen to move to an annual hike format from this year instead of the three-year fee-revision gap. ""If you wait for three years, sticking to10% turns difficult. So,wehavedecidedto raise the fee by 5%-7% every year which would not be a burden on parents,"" said principal Seema Sapru.

Modern High School for Girls had its last fee revision two years ago. Don Bosco Park Circus, too, has continued with its annual 10% hike taking the monthly fee for 2018-2019 to Rs 3,500. La Martiniere Schools had a 10% fee hike from last year. St Xavier's Collegiate School is among the few big schools whose fee structure remains unchanged from 2017. Calcutta Public School went in for a less than 10% hike."

Tuition fee hike will be capped at 15% per year and schools will have to make the fee structure public by December 31.

A notification to this effect was issued by the primary and secondary education department on Friday.

This comes two years after the Karnataka Education Institutions (Classification, Regulation and Prescription of curricula etc,) (Amendment) Rules 2016 were introduced as part of the Siddaramaiah government's efforts to rein in private schools charging exorbitant fees.

The notification makes it mandatory for schools to disclose the following information by December 31 every year: fee structure for the ensuing academic year, audit report of the school's finances in the previous financial year which ended on March 31, details of teaching resources, results of public examinations and a statement showing computation and compliance of fee structure as per the department's rules. The school can't charge more fee than the sum disclosed.

The order has restricted fee increase, saying that tuition fee for the ensuing year to be collected from all students (except RTE quota) shouldn't be more than 15% over and above the amount charged during the current academic year.

The education department also stated that fee calculation should be made considering the normative total expenditure for the ensuing academic year, which should be computed based on the actual salary expenditure incurred on teaching and non-teaching staff, including outsourced staff and operational costs in the previous financial year.

The notification also re-attempts to penalize schools for fee violations. Institutions are supposed to pay a fine of Rs 10 lakh for charging exorbitant fee, a sum which has not been revised for 18 years, but the department hasn't been able to implement the rule.

Not just that. The draft notification also mandates schools not to levy additional amounts (above the fee) on students admitted under the RTE quota. This comes at a time when the RTE task force has been complaining to the department about some private schools charging fee for uniforms and text books.

The draft reiterates that school development fee cannot be levied on children availing the quota."

The circular issued on May 9 says that no action shall be taken against schools.

""The honourable high court, Jodhpur in its interim order has directed the office (department) to not act against schools in cases related to Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) until cases (related to the fees act) pending in court are disposed off,"" said a circular issued by the education department on May 9. Sources said that almost a dozen cases challenging the legality of the fee Act were pending before the court.

' Govt can only guide us in fixing school fees '

Around 20 schools in Rajsamand and Jodhpur have filed a petition against the Act. The schools contended that they were autonomous bodies and the government can only guide them in fixing the fees.

""Our case is very strong. The Act is a violation of our rights guaranteed by the Constitution. It will not stand in the court,"" said one petitioner.

The education department had served notices to over 7,000 schools over unjust fee hikes. The circular has come as a relief for schools but has left parents and the government jittery. Parents were hoping to get relief from fee hikes of up to 30% made by schools. Government officials are still studying the order which is not clear on whether the schools can charge the hiked fees from students. ""Our legal team is examining the implications of the interim order,"" said a government officer requesting anonymity.

The state government, which had earlier cancelled the no-objection certificate (NOC) of BVB Vidhyashram school over the fee hike issue, is in a dilemma on whether to restore the NOC or to maintain status quo.

Damodar Goyal, president, Society for Unaided Schools in Rajasthan, said, ""As per the Supreme Court order, fee fixation is the prerogative of schools. The Act which calls for the involvement of parents in fixing fees violates the autonomy of schools."""

The ongoing protests by parents against the exorbitant hike in fee by private schools in Jaipur got a fresh impetus Saturday with the Prime Minister's Office stepping in after taking cognisance of a letter written by an aggrieved parent,

Replying to a letter written by the parent of a student at Bharatiya Vidya Bhawan Vidyashram School highlighting the excessive fee hike, the PMO, in the letter dated April 27, has directed the Rajasthan chief secretary to take action in the matter.

Deepak Jain, a parent, had written to the PMO on April 23, seeking its intervention in the matter. He had also attached the notices issued by the district education officer (DEO) and the director of secondary education department to Vidyashram School for hiking the fee by up to 40 per cent this year.

The letter stated that the school's action was in violation of The Rajasthan Schools (Fee Regulation) Act, 2016 and demanded that the fee hike be revoked.

Last week, the Directorate of Secondary Education had also cancelled the school's No Objection Certificate (NOC). However, hearing a PIL filed by the school, the Rajasthan High Court ordered the government to not take any coercive action against the educational institute.

The school has asked the parents to deposit the hiked fees by May 9.

The PMO has asked the state government to reply to the petitioner and a copy of the same to be uploaded on the portal.

Parents of students at Vidyashram school, meanwhile, carried out a candle light march Saturday evening.

Parents across the city have been protesting against the fee hike by private schools since the start of this academic session in April. While some of the schools had rolled back the fee hike after the protests, others have refused to do so."

School authorities called the police to disperse the parents from the premises. When contacted, principal Vidya Sharma refused to comment on the matter.

The school hiked the fee by 25 to 40 percent since the beginning of the new session in April. Parents have voiced their dissent and have filed a writ in the high court challenging the fee hike. The school, on the other hand, also filed a writ challenging the authority of the education department to regulate the school fees.

""The school administration has been harassing students and threatening to take them to the police if their dues are not cleared,"" a parent said on condition of anonymity.

Parents alleged that the school authorities have been singling out students who have not yet paid their fees and threatening to take action against them. The school has extended the last date for the submission of fees to April 30.

Director of secondary education Nathmal Didel has given the school a final chance to present their case in person at the directorate on Monday. In case the school representatives failed to show up, the directorate would have the liberty to cancel the school's No Objection Certificate (NOC), Didel had said.

The final warning was given to the school after they failed to comply with Didel's notice and did not show up on Thursday.

A protest was also staged in front of St Angela Sophia Senior Secondary School by some parents who alleged that the school has hiked the fees by 35 per cent this year.

The school's principal Sister Ramona denied the allegations. ""We have raised the fees by 14 per cent, that too, in compliance with the provisions of the fee regulation Act. The hike is mostly to meet the expense of teachers' salaries,"" Sister Ramona said.

Under the Fee Regulation Act, private schools are supposed to form fee regulation committees with representatives from the school and parents to decide on the fee hike. However, since the beginning of the new session in April, several schools raised the fees by a considerable amount, which led to the protest. The aggrieved parents said that the schools did not form any committee nor consulted the parents and raised the fees arbitrarily."

Ramesh Rana, president of Haryana Parents' Forum For Education, said, ""All schools raise fees every session by 10-12%. They don't ask parents what the hike should be. They raise school fees at will in the name of rising costs.""

In the second poll, 87% parents said their respective state governments have not taken any action in years to regulate the yearly hikes, while only 13% said otherwise.

Dev Kumar, president of DPSG Parents' Association, said, ""Had the Haryana government acted against the schools, who are always looking to hike the fee, the disparity wouldn't have been so much. There are schools in the city which are run by MPs, MLAs and corporates. This is an education mafia and the state government easily accepts whatever they say.""

When parents were asked about the root cause of these hikes, around 61% said it was due to a lack of regulation by the state, while 14% said it was due to a lack of enforcement by district officers. Many of them also cited lack of funds as the possible reason.

Sameer Nasa, whose kid studies in Blue Bells School, said, ""The state is not willing to regulate school fees because the entire system has become greedy. Schools are increasing the fee citing the Seventh Pay Commission, which is wrong.""

The survey further revealed that 72% parents are of the opinion that fee hike should be based on a model that ties it to the rate of inflation, while 22% said there should be a 10% cap on hikes.

Bhupinder Singh, whose kid study in Narayana e Techno School, Sector 37, said, ""There should be a capon school fee hikes by the authorities. Why should the school alone get to decide this? It shouldn't be raised beyond 3-5% annually.""

On the other hand, schools said the annual hikes are justified. Vaibhav Kapoor, principal of Ajanta Public School, Sector 31, said, ""Every year, we have to increase the teacher's salary. Invariably, we have to do it by increasing the school fee. It's also based on improvements in infrastructure.""

Deepika Sharma, principal of DPSG, Palam Vihar, said, ""The fee hike in our school this year is less than 10%. We do it every year to keep up with maintenance and other costs. There are 15 teacher workshops which are held 'round the year, for which NCERT charges us a lot."""

The Fee Regulation Committee of the Ahmedabad zone, while allowing 5 per cent hike in school fees, has indicted private schools of charging ""exorbitant fees"", saying that ""there appears to be a systematic attempt on the part of school management to claim inflated expenses"".

In its April 2 order, the Committee, assigned with the task of determining provisional fees of 32 self-financed schools of nine districts, stated: ""Fees proposed by many schools are exorbitant as compared to the fees charged by them for earlier years. There appears to be a systematic attempt on the part of school management to claim inflated expenses by way of payment of excessive rents for school building, transportation charges and other activity charges.""

The nine districts that fall under the Committee, chaired by retired Gujarat High Court judge K A Puj, are Ahmedabad city, Ahmedabad district, Gandhinagar, Mehsana, Patan, Sabarkantha, Banskantha, Aravalli, Botad and Kutch.

""In many cases, the school management is collecting fees under different heads such as uniform charges, meal charges, activity charges etc. If these are optional and students are free to choose, there may not be any problem. However, when they are compulsory, the element of profit may not be ruled out,"" it added.

The Committee also stated that many schools have failed to submit their complete records. However, it has also allowed the schools to charge higher fee for the year 2018-19 and 2019-20.

""It is made clear that no school is permitted to collect fees for the first quarter of 2018-19 more than the provisional fees determined for the year 2017-18 with 5 per cent rise therein,"" the order read. The annual fees for 2017-18 as decided by the Committee stand at Rs 27,700, Rs 28,600 and Rs 30,800 for pre-primary, lower primary and upper primary classes, respectively.

The Committee has also accepted its limitations in deciding the fee in a short span of time. ""Since the provisional fees for each of these schools are to be determined within a time-bound framework it may not be possible to minutely examine all these details. This exercise will be undertaken by the committee after considering objections, if any, raised by any school against determination of provisional fees by the committee,"" the order further added.

""We'll be approaching local court against the fee hike in private schools since FFRC has not been doing its job. As of now, we'll move to court against two reputed schools of Gurgaon and Faridabad,"" added Sheoran.

While earlier the FFRC conducted yearly audits of selected schools, the process halted after some private schools appealed against its order and questioned its role in the fee regulation."

In order to keep an eye on arbitrary fee hike by private schools, including minority institutions, the Uttar Pradesh government will soon be promulgating an ordinance. Schools with classes 1 to 12 charging over Rs 20,000 per annum as fees will come under its ambit. Deputy Chief Minister Dr Dinesh Sharma told PTI, ""Once the ordinance is notified, the new rules will come into effect from the present academic session (2018-19) prohibiting schools from raising fees arbitrarily. If any school wishes to hike fees, it will have to approach a regulatory committee headed by a divisional commissioner.

Representatives of parents and school management will also be members of the pannel. All the private schools will be covered by the new legislation. However, pre-schools have been kept outside its ambit, Sharma said.

Schools will only be allowed to hike fees by seven to eight per cent after taking permission from the committee, based on the consumer price index and increase in salaries of staff. The draft of the ordinance was approved at a meeting of the state cabinet and seeks to tighten the noose around schools charging hefty fees, the deputy chief minister said.

""We are committed to stop harassment of parents and arbitrary increase in fees by private self-financed schools,"" Sharma said, explaining the salient features of the measure. He added that after the governor's assent, a notification will be issued and it will be implemented immediately in letter and spirit.

""Not only books, but uniforms, shoes and socks are sold by schools or parents are forced to buy these from a certain shop. Our government is committed to check all these wrong practice,"" he said.

Those schools which will break the rules will have to pay a fine of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh will be levied on schools for their first and second violations, respectively. If a school repeats the mistake, it will be de-recognised. The government has kept a four-point agenda in mind that includes ""happy teacher, tension-free students, copying-free examinations and quality education"", he said.

On the need for such a legislation, Sharma said, ""Education, which was a service earlier, has now become a business. Parents are exploited after their wards get admission."" ""Not only books, but uniforms, shoes and socks are sold by schools or parents are forced to buy these from a certain shop. Our government is committed to check all these wrong practice,"" he said.

""We also sought suggestions and even got 134 objections, which were taken note of while preparing the draft,"" he said

""Legal options were also explored and advice of former high court judges was also taken to avoid any legal loopholes.

""Finally a committee headed by the chief secretary okayed it, before it was presented before the cabinet,"" Sharma said, adding that the measure was welcomed by parents all over the state. ""Many a times the meetings ran late into the night, even till 2 AM.

Now schools will have to put income generated from commercial activities such as giving its premises for marriage and other functions under the development category, Sharma said. The funds will be spent on increasing teachers salaries and facilities in the school, he said

""Till now, schools used such income in the commercial head and schools did not get any benefit from them (in the form of development). Also, we could not stop them from commercial use so we decided to insert a clause asking them to show such income in school development fund,"" he said.

In Uttar Pradesh, of the total only 15 per cent schools are government-run, while rest 85 per cent schools are privately managed and these will be covered through this new law, he said.

For the last few days he has been under immense pressure, not over his work, but over his daughter's education. He had received intimation that the fee was to be hiked substantially for the upcoming year and since then, he has been wondering what he can do to ensure that he can pay his child's school fee. Ravi is one of many parents in the city who are feeling the heat, not because of the summer but rather because private schools in the city have hiked their fees. The surge in school fees ranges from Rs 6,000 to over '30,000 per annum in some cases. Schools are tight-lipped about why the fee is being increased so drastically.

""My daughter's school fee has been increased from '1.1 lakh to about '1.4 lakh,"" said M Ashwin*, a parent of a class 7 student at a private school in South Chennai. ""They have not given us any reason for the increase but if at all someone asks, they say it is because they are building a sports arena. This sports arena has not been completed so long. In the process, the children have not been playing for the last one year. It is ridiculous.""Further, parents said they hesitated to question the fee hike as they thought their children might then be subjected to ill-treatment by the staff and teachers in schools.

While some parents allege that the Goods and Services Tax has led to the surge in fees, schools dismiss this claim and called the hike a 'routine' one. ""The fee hike is done every year in accordance with the guidelines set by the Fee Determination Committee,"" said Principal of a well-known private school on the condition of anonymity. ""The hike has little to do with the Goods and Services Tax. I don't see schools using that as a reason to increase the fees.""

She added that the fee structure is set by the Tamil Nadu Private Schools Fee Determination Committee and hence schools cannot violate what the committee lays down as the rate of increase for the stipulated period. ""Every three years every school has to approach the committee and based on the expenditure of the school and facilities, the committee sets a limit by which the school can hike the fees every year,"" she explained. ""Generally it is not more than 10% but it differs from school to school and board to board.""Last year, the fee committee under Justice TV Masilamani met for the first time in April and had reportedly discussed various issues like the logistics needed for the fee fixation process and enhancing the staff strength for the huge task.

The committee had said it would provide every school with the chance to present their facts and records before fixing the fee. It has the power to determine the fee to be collected by private schools and hear complaints with regards to collection of the fee in excess of the fee determined by it. However, when Express approached the committee to find out if schools were following the diktat issued by them, they said that there were schools which were flouting the rules. ""There are some schools that are charging amounts that are above the prescribed limit,"" said an official of the committee on the condition of anonymity.

""There are schools which are supposed to charge '9,000 as the fees but they charge '18,000 in the name of some trust or other facilities. They do this without the knowledge of the committee and if parents feel that the school is charging an exorbitant fee that is not justified or in line with the guidelines of the committee, they can approach the committee and complain. The committee will definitely look into it and take action.""

The official added that schools should not force parents to pay the entire amount in one go. He said it is mandatory for the fee to be split over three terms and for parents to be given the option of paying it before every term. He did, however, say that if a parent voluntarily wants to pay the fee at one time, that is permissible. Those from lesser privileged backgrounds are feeling the pinch more than anyone else. Many of them put a lot on the line just to ensure their children can go to a reputed private school and receive good education. The hope is that their children will not have to lead the lives that they did. However, with such a spike in fees, it makes it very hard for parents to keep their children in such schools.

""I am getting very worried now,"" said Rahul Kumar*, who works as a driver for a family and is sending his son to a private school in the suburbs for education. ""The school has not intimated us about a hike as yet but I heard from many people that the fee is being hiked steeply this year; so I am very uneasy. I wanted my son to get a good education; but, if it continues like this, I will have to send him back to my village to study because the city schools are too expensive.""For parents whose children are graduating from Montessori school to LKG too, the fee figure is a looming nightmare.

The cabinet on Tuesday gave an in-principle approval to the UP Self-Financed Schools (Fixation of Fee) Ordinance 2018, failing to which the licence of the school will be revoked.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said, ""The fee process will be more transparent now with only four type of fees like booklet fee, entrance fee, examination fee and joint annual fee. Private schools will have to charge admission fees only once per student. If a school fails to comply with the ordinance more than twice, its licence may also be revoked.""

Sharma said the fee structure of private schools will be divided into two categories. ""The first is what the school can charge from students, including admission fees, exam fees, registration fees and annual fees. For all remaining heads, students will pay only for those services which they avail. It will be mandatory for schools to give receipt of all types of fees,"" he added.

Regarding changing school dresses from time to time, the Deputy CM said the government has no desire to interfere in their day-to-day functioning.

""We are only reacting to complaints by parents. Once the ordinance comes into force, the uniforms won't be changed before five years. The schools can also not force parents or students to purchase the uniform from a certain dealer.""

As per the ordinance, private schools who are charging fees of over Rs 20,000 per student per year won't be able to increase the fees by more than 7-8% annually. The base year for calculation of increase in fee is 2015-16 and if parents have paid more than what is required, the extra amount will be refunded. Also, the school cannot take the entire fee for one year as annual fee; they will have to take it quarterly or half-yearly.

Most importantly, as per the ordinance, a committee will be formed under all divisional commissioners, which will comprise a chartered accountant, a PWD engineer and one representative of a school's parents association. The committee will be empowered to look into any kind of dispute related to the school."

The astronomical rise in fees has left parents in a financial soup. But, what is shocking is, unbeknown to parents, the new fee has been decided in 'consultation' with them.

As per the Act, the fee is decided in every school by a 10-member school fee committee which includes five parents, three teachers and two representatives from the school administration.

The committee proposes the hike after considering the expenses, facilities, teachers' qualification, etc. Sources said that the state expected to restrict the yearly rise between 5% and 8%.

But most of the schools have raised the fees above the maximum, with BVB Vidhyashram increasing it by a whopping 27%.

The annual fees for classes I to 5 jumped from Rs 68,000 in 2017-18 to Rs 84,000 in 2018-19. TOI repeatedly called up the school to speak to the principal but received no response.

Parents said that they feel cheated about the hike approved by the school-level fee committee for the new academic session.

The Act says that every school has to form a Parent -Teacher Association (PTA), with five if its members picked through lottery for the fee committee.

The names of members in the committee have to be displayed on the notice board within a period 15 days from the formation of the committee.

But when TOI spoke to parents of students studying in various schools, they expressed ignorance about the formation of any such committee.

Anubha Goyal, a mother of two children studying in classes 4 and 9 at BVB Vidhyashram, was not aware about the role of parents in deciding the fees. ""The hike is not justifiable. The facilities they provide to our children are very minimal. The furniture is broken and tears the uniform. Even big classrooms have only two fans which make it unbearable for our children. I have complained many times to the authority, but no action has been taken,"" she said.

According to the Act, the PTA has to meet before August 15 and the school-level fee committee has to meet once every three months. None of the parents that TOI contacted have been invited for the general meeting or informed about the fee committee.

What is more surprising is that many schools have not formed the committee due to objections while others due to ignorance. Sarita Katiyar, principal of Ryan International School, Mansarovar, said the school has not formed the fee committee. ""I am not aware of constituting any committee for fee fixing,"" said Katiyar. TOI repeatedly called Lata Rawat, the principal of Cambridge Court High School, to enquire about fee hike but received no response.

With tension mounting between parents and schools over the issue, sparks are set to fly at the start of the next academic session."

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has approved a cap of up to 8 per cent fee hike in private schools of Chandigarh, according to the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016, with some modifications.

What happens next?

In its order, the High Court has stated that the draft of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institution Bill, 2016, has been sent for publication at the government press for issuing the notification. Education Secretary B L Sharma said the rules will be in effect on the date the notification is published, which may happen in a week or so. For any act, the implementation starts from the day of publication of the notification. In this case, the UT education department will circulate an advisory on the rules to be implemented at all the private schools once the notification is out. The next hearing is on April 19 where HC will listen to the status report on the matter.

Will the rules be implemented at private schools from the 2018-19 session?

With the new session about to begin in the first week of April, the fee hike rules will not apply to private schools this session as parents have already paid the fees. Sharma said any transaction made before the notification will not be covered by the new rules. ""It is a breather for private schools this session as they have vehemently opposed the implementation of the Punjab rules. But, they will have to comply from the session 2019-20,"" he added. In February, when the proposal was in its final stage of approval with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the education department planned to extend the February 12 deadline for fee submission in schools. However, this did not materialise due to a delay in approval. This year, schools have hiked the fee between 8 per cent and 12 per cent.

Why has this remained a contentious issue between parents and schools? Why did the education department decide to mirror the Punjab rules?

In the absence of a proper policy, schools hike the fee by 10-12 per cent each year. In 2017, after a number of parents moved court on the fee hike by private schools, the UT Administration told the High Court that it has proposed to extend the Punjab rules to Chandigarh. A draft was prepared by the education department last year and they were awaiting a nod from the Centre for its implementation.

A petitioner, Ritesh Pandey, approached the court through a PIL in February 2017, seeking directions on the arbitrary fee hike of private schools. Pandey submitted that the schools have hiked the fee by 10 per cent, by clubbing the development and tuition fees. Schools, on the other hand, say there is a high possibility that the implementation will face a lot of litigation from the schools. According to them, a ruling by the Supreme Court states that schools can increase the fee up to 10 per cent. Another SC ruling also says that there can be no parity between the fee structure of schools as each offers a different educational experience.

Under the Societies Registration Act, charitable organisations could seek tax concession if there was a surplus expenditure of up to 10 per cent. Beyond that, it became a commercial activity and then they could be brought under the tax net. Hence, the ruling by the Supreme Court.

What do the Punjab fee regulation rules state and what are the modifications proposed by UT?

Besides providing for the constitution of a regulatory body, the rules contain provisions on imposing penalty on the educational institutions resorting to unjustified hike of the annual fee.

The UT, in its draft policy, proposed to double the penalty in case a school violates the rules. The MHA asked UT to amend the policy for the penalty to be stricter.

This fine can go up to Rs 2 lakh, according to the new rules. Schools will have to justify the fee hike under the Act and submit to audit by the education department to justify their hike.

They demanded that the schools be taken over by the state government under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay model school scheme under which 166 new schools have been started by the UP government.

Built in 2010, schools were free for first two years and fees started being charged in 2012. However, in 2018 the schools revealed the new structure to new and old students.

While two-month fee for a class VI child in SC/ST category till 2017 was Rs 5,775 including three fee sections -- pupil fee, tution fee and transport charges, the fee has been increased to Rs 16,950 in 2018- -- almost three times the previous year. The new sections include admission fee, caution money (refundable), maintenance charge, co-curricular activity, examination and e-learning and lab fee.

They alleged a minor percentage was reduced from the fees after a meeting with Meerut mandal commissioner Prabhat Kumar, who is also the chairman of Noida-Greater Noida education society, which manages four schools funded by authorities.

""We met the commissioner 10 days ago and he promised some respite but to our shock, fee was reduced by between Rs 500-1,000,"" a parent said.

Senior management staff of a school run by the Church of North India (CNI) , for instance, feared that they might find it difficult to maintain the old school building which has a heritage status. ""We spend crores on upkeep. We also provide free education to financially weak students. How can we run a school if we decide to increase only 10% development fee every year?"" he asked.

A senior school principal pointed out that salary of staff, yearly increment and the enhanced government DA were an addition to its expenses, apart from the house rent allowance for teachers. ""How can a school, which pays for all of this from the students' fee, afford a mere 10% development fee hike every year. We have several school buildings which need upkeep. It is not possible to implement such decisions without uniform consent from schools,"" he said.

Some schools with minority status protested the government's possible decision to ""impose"" the fee cap. Sources said they are worried of the state trying to breach their autonomous status as they are only governed by the set of rules framed by the church and do not even come under the RTE Act, 2009.

A school which had initially sent a representative to the self-regulation commission said they were not keen to implement the decision till the Church takes a call.

Another school principal, however, welcomed the initiative. . But he felt that the new structure should not be imposed. ""Let the state create a neutral accreditation body which can determine fee. If schools satisfy norms then they should be graded and allowed to charge fee as per the grade. A general slab can't be fixed for schools,"" he said."

The government will launch this new initiative from ensuing academic year.

Besides, the government proposes to increase the number of parents' representation on PTA, an executive body whose approval is must for a fee increase. Henceforth, more parents can be appointed on PTA through lottery system as the government had received several complaints that even parents' representatives were selected in such a way that they would be in favour of the management.

In order to give much needed relief to parents, the government proposes to give them freedom to purchase school material from the shops of their choice, and not those assigned by the school.

While several schools had initiated the process of a school fee hike as early as in December, some had put the hike on hold in view of the government order. Weeks after the HC quashing the government order, parents flay that the government is a mute spectator to their misery.

""Several schools that had not issued the hike fee circular earlier are now doing it much more boldly. Parents can't even say anything because they have gotten a stay on the government department's order to carry forward last year's fee this year as well,"" said Seema Agarwal, a parent.Schools like Scholars International School, St Andrews School, Kennedy High The Global School, are some of the schools that have reissued the fee structure with a hike. Depending upon the category of the school, the hike is anything between 3 to 10 per cent. For most upper budget international schools it is 10 per cent hike. ""In our knowledge, there is hardly any school that has not increased the fee after the HC order. Those that had issued the circular but held it up after the GO have reissued along with those that had not issued any notification them,"" said Pavan Reddy, from Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA).

Parents rue that the little hope they had got from the status quo of the Education Department has also vanished. ""We were hopeful that finally, something favourable was happening. But that was not to be. I will be spending close to Rs 1.75 lakh on fees for this year for my two daughters,"" said Ghazala Syed, who will be shelling out Rs 40,000 towards transportation fee of her two kids."

Parents' associations and NGOs in different cities such as Mumbai, Nasik, and Allahabad are coordinating the protests.

In Bengaluru, silent protests are being organised in Marathahalli and Whitefield.

AB Suresh, one of the key organisers in the city, said the protests were mainly against the fee hike by private schools which is more than 10% every year.

""It is against both the state and central government policies. A major thing is that schools are increasing the fee on the excuse that they have to admit children under the Right to Education quota without the fee. They claim that the money reimbursed by the government is not enough and we are forced to make up for it,"" Suresh, a parent, said.

Another bone of contention is that the majority of schools do not have a democratically-elected parent-teachers association (PTA).

""We have no idea what is happening to the fee we pay. We have no say in what happens in the school. Some schools have a PTA for namesake. But they have only parents who are on the management's side,"" he said."

The top four, includes,

Indian School of Business, Hyderabad ranked at #28 Indian Institute of Management- Ahmedabad ranked at #31 Indian Institute of Management- Bangalore ranked at #35 Indian Institute of Management- Calcutta ranked at #78

IIM-Bangalore has moved up to rank #35 from 49th, while IIM-Calcutta climbed from 95 to 78th spot.

Although the rankings for the top Indian b-schools in the index saw a dip, there was a positive for ISB-Hyderabad. The Indian School of Business, joined a list of premiere b-schools posting a three-figure salary-difference, in the FT survey.

The top honors for the highest salary difference was with Chinese b-schools. The top 5 b-schools with a three figure salary percentage increase were,

Shanghai Jiao Tong University: Antai with an average weighted salary of $121635, posted a 182% increase. Fudan University School of Management, China, with an average weighted salary of $103032, a 175% increase.

Although one may think that this list is a feature of the top global b-schools, it did not include b-schools from developed economies such as Israel, Japan and even OPEC countries such as Saudi Arabia, and UAE. Yes, FT rankings only included schools accredited by AACSB, but then Universities in countries such as Israel and Japan were accredited by AACSB.

The list features 100 b-schools, but only from 17 countries. The bulk of b-schools were in the US (50), the others were spread in countries such as UK (14), China (7), France (4) and India (4).

Though disappointed, they are preparing to challenge the court stay legally in the coming days. Hyderabad School Parents Association (HSPA), that has been fighting the indiscriminate hike in fees by schools, claims it had anticipated the stay. ""We knew the school managements would try to stay the government order and hence wanted the government to file a caveat in the court. However, the government's unwillingness resulted in the stay,"" say association members. Not being a party in the case, the HSPA could not file a caveat on its own.

""HSPA had also contacted the Government Pleader for the Education Department to inform HSPA on the filing of any case by any school or school association so that HSPA could effectively intervene in the issue. Neither was a caveat filed nor were we informed for reasons best known to the government,"" said Seema Agarwal of HSPA.

""Had the government impressed upon the court that the issue has been pending since 2009, and that between 2009 and 2018 school fees have increased by a massive 500 per cent, the court would not have, perhaps, passed the interim order,"" fume parents. ""The government also has at its disposal all the proofs of extreme profiteering by schools, including those submitted by HSPA. However, these too it seems, have not been brought to the notice of HC,"" alleged Seema.

A statement issued by HSPA has questioned the government's intention in the matter. ""The actions or the lack of it seem to suggest that the government finds the schools more powerful than itself. That is why it is acquiescing meekly before the schools allowing them to ride roughshod over all its orders,"" it read.

Meanwhile, most parents feel the respite they got from the freezing of fee hike is now over and they now have to revise their budgets to accommodate additional expenditure. ""It is only a matter of days when the schools will send circulars detailing their new and hiked fee structure. Several schools had already sent the new fee structure but had to grudgingly withdraw it due to the government directive,"" said Rachana Sharma, a parent.

What next?

""We will be fighting this order in the courts for sure. The best way to move ahead legally is either by impleading in the present case or by the filing of a separate Writ Appeal against this judgment. We will decide our course of action after consultation with our legal team,"" said Ashish Naredi, a member.

She said that as per Government Orders admission process has to start on January 2 and the final list had to be displayed by January 12.

However, the Government issued the orders to maintain the status quo on the fee on January 4 itself, which is much before the admissions were finalised.

Schools continue to violate the government orders, some openly and some discreetly. Some schools are however approaching a cautious path and reminding parents that the report was in their favour, particularly with regard to 10% fee hike every year and nothing much will emerge from the government's study.

Parents want the government to strictly monitor the schools and respond quickly to their complaints on the issue.

They also fear that schools will adopt an innovative method to continue their 'loot', collecting the existing fee in the first term and change their module in the second and third terms when the heat is likely to be substantially lower.

""We are getting complaints from parents that some have already indicated to them about collecting the increased fee in the second and third terms while looking to follow the government order for the first term,"" a representative of Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) said.

Members of the HSPA, who have led a fight against fee hike over the last two years, feel the lack of fear among the schools regarding withdrawal of recognition or the NOCs issued for flouting norms is a serious concern.

However, the disrespect to the report by the school managements and strong reaction from parents has forced the government to serve memos to the managements of some top schools. The Directorate of School Education called the managements of over 20 schools that have acquired notoriety for fee hike. The Directorate also presented the copies of the government order to maintain status quo till the final call.

Deputy Chief Minister and Education Minister, Kadiyam Srihari, asked the parents not to pay the increased fee when HSPA representatives met him to discuss the developments."

""We pointed out that since the report questioned only the fee hike percentage and not the base fee, a school charging ' 50,000 as fees in 2017-18 could increase it by 100 per cent, making it '1 lakh in 2018-19 and then also expect a minimum hike of 10 pc over and above that every year as per Prof Rao's recommendations,"" said Ashish Naredi, a member of HSPA.
