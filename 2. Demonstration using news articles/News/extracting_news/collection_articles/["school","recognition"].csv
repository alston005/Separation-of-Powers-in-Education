US Senator Elizabeth Warren (in pic), a liberal firebrand who has taken on Wall Street and traded barbs with Donald Trump, on Monday became the most prominent Democrat to announce a challenge to the Republican president in 2020.

Warren said she had formed an exploratory committee, which will allow her to begin raising money to compete in what is expected to be a crowded Democratic primary field before the November 2020 presidential election.

She said on Twitter she would announce her decision on whether to run early in 2019.

Warren, 69, a senator from Massachusetts since 2013, became one of Trump's fiercest critics during the 2016 presidential race and they have continued to exchange biting insults during his presidency. Trump mockingly refers to her as ""Pocahontas"" because of her claim to Native American ancestry.

Warren has denounced Trump as an ""insecure money grubber"" with a platform of ""racism, sexism and xenophobia,"" while Trump has described the former Harvard Law School professor as ""goofy"" and a ""lowlife"" with ""a nasty mouth.""

On Monday, Warren released a video in which she outlined her vision of a path to opportunity for all Americans and charged that the US middle class was under attack from corporate interests. She later elaborated on the theme in an exchange with reporters outside her Cambridge, Massachusetts, home.

""America's middle class is getting hollowed out and opportunity for too many of our young people is shrinking,"" she said. ""So I'm in this fight all the way. Right now Washington works great for the wealthy and the well connected. It's just not working for anyone else.""

Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News, said he would love to run against Warren and again ridiculed her assertion of Native American ancestry. Asked if he thought Warren really believed she could defeat him, Trump said: ""I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

The Democratic presidential field could eventually include Senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as former Vice President Joe Biden. Julian Castro, former President Barack Obama's housing secretary, formed an exploratory committee this month.

Warren welcomed the ""strong and growing group of Democrats"" making arguments similar to those she is making, saying: ""That's how we build a movement. We do it together.""

In searching for a candidate to run against Trump, Democrats will grapple with the tension between the party's establishment and liberal progressive wings that flared during the 2016 nominating primaries between former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who ran under the Democratic banner.

A Warren candidacy can expect opposition from Wall Street. In the US Senate, she has been a strong voice on financial issues and a self-described defender of the ordinary American against powerful interests.

Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks' retail business from their riskier investment banking activities.

Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration's efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law.

In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. ""Oh yeah,"" she told the New York Times. ""Give me a chance.""

She also has opposed the administration's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co.

Many of Warren's policy positions have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for seniors to include everyone.

Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as ""another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.""

Warren's 80 per cent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said.

""Some Democrats swear by her and love her blunt style, while others are put off by her and fear she'd lose to Trump,"" he said. ""Warren has a lot of convincing to do,"" adding the same is true of many other Democratic contenders. Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said.

Trump's use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race.

Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage.

Trump's reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticised Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage."

In 2006-2007, in the early years of the Web 2.0 that emerged phoenix like from the ashes of the dotcom bust of 2000, Michael Wesch, Professor of digital ethnography at Kansas State University, produced a video called ""The Machine is Us/ing Us"". Prior to the emergence of Web 2.0, the world wide web was primarily a read-only medium to publish news and information to a passive audience. Web 2.0, with its focus on user-generated content and a personal network of trust, created a read-write platform that allowed individuals to feed information easily into the system or 'the machine'.

In the process, the machine learnt stuff that it never knew before. Wikipedia, one of the first Web 2.0 platforms, became the biggest repository of information, if not knowledge. This in turn allowed it to influence a whole generation of students, journalists and web users, and shape the way they view the world. For example, this author who has studied in a Catholic missionary school, had had a great regard for Francis Xavier. But this was completely reversed after he read the Wikipedia article about the murderous inquisition that Xavier had unleashed on the Hindus of Goa. Obviously, no one at school had ever talked about such unsavoury matters.

The thrust of Wesch's video was that every action that a person takes in the digital world is used as an input by 'the digital machine' to increase its own knowledge of both the physical world and recursively, about the digital world. Every 'like' of a post on social media or a click on hyperlink on a web page or a mobile app is like a drop of information that individually and collectively adds to the pool of knowledge about what humans know and think.

This, in turn, is used to shape our own worldview by returning recommendations of what next to view, 'like' and click again. Unless you are like Richard Stallman, an advocate of extreme privacy who hardly uses anything digital -- like Google search, cell phones or credit cards -- you have no escape from this tight embrace of the machine. Fortunately, the machine is not yet one monolithic device. Its world has been broken up into fragments -- Google, Baidu, Amazon, Alibaba and Facebook -- by high commercial walls. But in its tireless striving, it certainly does stretch its arms into every nook and corner of human activity and through that, the human mind.

In parallel with the growth of the web, there has been the emergence of data science. This began as an extension of statistics and has evolved into machine learning. Then again there was the classical 1960s style artificial intelligence that, after lying dormant for nearly 30 years, suddenly woke up and adopted the neural network structure of the brain as a new model of machine learning. This neural network model, often referred to as deep learning is the new age artificial intelligence (AI) and it is racing forward with some truly stunning applications in the area of voice and image recognition, language translation, guidance and control of autonomous vehicles, and in decision-making as in loan disbursement and hiring of employees.

Data science has moved through three distinct stages of being descriptive -- reporting data, inferential -- drawing conclusions from data through the acceptance or rejection of hypotheses and finally predictive -- as in the new-age AI. What has really accelerated the adoption and usage of this new AI has been the availability of data and hardware. The backpropagation algorithm that lies at the heart of all neural network based AI systems that are popular today was developed in the 1960s and 1970s but it has become useful only in the last decade.

It is driven by the availability of (a) huge amounts of data, collectable and collected through the web by the machine described in the Wesch video, and (b) enormous yet inexpensive computing power that is available on rentable virtual machines from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure.

The key driver in this field is cloud computing. Instead of purchasing and installing physical hardware, companies rent virtual machines in the cloud to both store and process data. The simplest and most ubiquitous example of this is Gmail, where both our mail and the mail server are located somewhere in the Internet cloud that we can access with a browser.

But this same model has been used for many mission-critical, corporate applications ranging from e-commerce through enterprise resource planning to supply chain and customer relationship management systems. Though there has been some resistance to cloud computing because of the insecurity of placing sensitive company data on a vendor machine, the price performance is so advantageous that most new software services are all deployed in the cloud -- and that includes machine learning and AI applications.

Cloud service vendors have aggressively marketed their services by not only offering high-end hardware -- as virtual machines -- at very low prices but also by offering incredibly powerful software applications. Complex machine learning software for, say, image recognition, language translation that are ordinarily very difficult to develop are now available and accessible almost as easily as email or social media. Cloud computing services are categorised into Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The first category provides a general purpose computing platform with a virtual machine, an operating system, programming languages and database services, where developers can build and deploy applications without purchasing any hardware. The second category is even simpler to use because the software -- like email as in the case of Gmail -- is already there. One needs to subscribe (or purchase) the service, obtain the access credentials, like user ID and password, connect and start using the services right away -- nothing to build or deploy. It is already there waiting to be used.

In an earlier article in Swarajya (March 2017), we had seen how machine learning and now, the new age AI, use huge, terabyte size, sets of training data to create software models that can be used for predictive analytics. This is an expensive exercise that lies beyond the ability of individuals and most corporates. But with AI or machine learning available as SaaS at a fraction of the cost, new software applications that use these services can be built easily. For example, it would be possible to enhance a widely-used accounting software by replacing the user ID/password based login process with a face recognition based login process.

Similarly, the enormous difficulty of building the software for a self driving car, or for a voice-activated IVR telephony, can be drastically reduced by using AI-as-a-Service from a cloud services vendor. Obviously, all cloud services including SaaS assume the existence of rugged, reliable and high-speed data connectivity between the service provider and the device on which the service is being used.

Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) can be seen as a logical extension of this model but a closer examination may yield a far deeper, or intriguing, insight.

Cloud Robotics, a new service from Google is scheduled to go live in 2019 and allow people to build smart robots very easily. It is inevitable that other cloud service vendors will follow suit. While many of us view robots as humanoids -- with arms, legs, glowing eyes, a squeaky voice or a stiff gait -- the reality is generally different. Depending on the intended use, a robot could be a vehicle, a drone, an arm in an automated assembly line or a device that controls valves, switches and levers in an industrial environment. In fact, a robot is anything that can sense its environment and take steps to do whatever it takes to achieve its goals. This is precisely the definition of intelligence or more specifically artificial intelligence. So a robot is an intelligent machine that can operate autonomously to meet its goals.

Traditional robots have this intelligence baked, or hard coded, into its 'brain' -- the physical computer that senses and responds to the stimuli that it receives from its environment. This is no different from its immediate role model -- humans. Human beings, and even most animals, learn how to react and respond to external stimuli ranging from a physical attack to a gentle question and we estimate this intelligence by the quality of their response.

In both cases, the knowledge of the external world as encoded in a model along with the ability to respond is stored locally -- either in the human brain or in the local computer. Cloud robotics replaces the local computer that controls a single robot with a shared computer -- located at the cloud service provider's premises -- that controls thousands of robots. Just as Gmail servers store, serve and otherwise control the mailboxes for millions of users each sitting at home, the cloud robotics servers sitting in some unknown corner of the Internet would be able to control millions of intelligent robots that are driving vehicles, flying drones, controlling devices and operating machines in farms, factories, mines and construction sites across the digitally connected physical world.

Circling back to the Wesch video, with which we began this article, these RaaS servers would not just be controlling machinery across the globe but would also be learning from the robots that it controls by using the robots to collect and build up its own pool of training data. This is an extension of the original Web 2.0 idea -- perhaps we could call it Web 3.0. Here, the machine has not only made a successful transition from the digital to the physical world, but also does not need humans anymore to teach it. It can become a self sustaining, self learning physical device.

Privacy would be an immediate issue and like all other cloud services, cloud robotics would be protected with access control and data encryption. But then as we have seen in the past, convenience trumps privacy. We all know that Google can read our Gmail but nevertheless, we still use Gmail simply because it is convenient and free! So would be the case with cloud robotics. We also know that the different RaaS vendors would try to isolate their own robots from interacting with the servers of other vendors or even from each other. But this could be a temporary reprieve. Collaboration among various vendors and pooling of data could happen either through mergers and acquisitions or because it is mandated by governments that are not concerned about privacy issues.

The need for privacy arises because each sentient human sees itself as a unique identity -- I, me and mine -- that is surely distinct from the collective crowd. My data becomes private because it needs to be protected, or shielded, from the collective crowd. But if we go back to the philosophical roots of the Indic Sanatana Dharma and explore the perspectives of Advaita Vedanta, we see that that this sense of ""I""ness is erroneous. Each apparently unique individual is actually a part of a transcendent and collective consciousness referred to as the Brahman.

The Brahman is the only reality and everything else is an error of perception. The world is maya, an illusion that perpetuates this sense of separateness, and creates this distinction between the individual and the world. The correct practice of yoga can lead to the removal of this veil of illusion and initiates the process of realisation. That is when the yogic adept sees the unbroken continuity between his own identity and that of the Brahman and experiences the ecstasy of enlightenment.

We know that many renowned yogis have actually experienced this enlightenment. AI products have now gone well past image and voice recognition and are now known to have the sophistication necessary to create their own private, non-human languages and original strategies in multi-user, role playing games. What we need to know is what happens when robots start emulating yogis and eventually realise their identity with the cloud robotics server of which they are a part."

by Natasha Singer

A police officer on the late shift in an Ohio town recently received an unusual call from Facebook.

Earlier that day, a local woman wrote a Facebook post saying she was walking home and intended to kill herself when she got there, according to a police report on the case. Facebook called to warn the Police Department about the suicide threat.

The officer who took the call quickly located the woman, but she denied having suicidal thoughts, the police report said. Even so, the officer believed she might harm herself and told the woman that she must go to a hospital -- either voluntarily or in police custody. He ultimately drove her to a hospital for a mental health work-up, an evaluation prompted by Facebook's intervention. (The New York Times withheld some details of the case for privacy reasons.)

Police stations from Massachusetts to Mumbai have received similar alerts from Facebook over the past 18 months as part of what is most likely the world's largest suicide threat screening and alert program. The social network ramped up the effort after several people livestreamed their suicides on Facebook Live in early 2017. It now utilizes both algorithms and user reports to flag possible suicide threats.

Facebook's rise as a global arbiter of mental distress puts the social network in a tricky position at a time when it is under investigation for privacy lapses by regulators in the United States, Canada and the European Union -- as well as facing heightened scrutiny for failing to respond quickly to election interference and ethnic hatred campaigns on its site. Even as Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, has apologized for improper harvesting of user data, the company grappled last month with fresh revelations about special data-sharing deals with tech companies.

The anti-suicide campaign gives Facebook an opportunity to frame its work as a good news story. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among people ages 15 to 29 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Some mental health experts and police officials said Facebook had aided officers in locating and stopping people who were clearly about to harm themselves.

Facebook has computer algorithms that scan the posts, comments and videos of users in the United States and other countries for indications of immediate suicide risk. When a post is flagged, by the technology or a concerned user, it moves to human reviewers at the company, who are empowered to call local law enforcement.

""In the last year, we've helped first responders quickly reach around 3,500 people globally who needed help,"" Zuckerberg wrote in a November post about the efforts.

But other mental health experts said Facebook's calls to police could also cause harm -- such as unintentionally precipitating suicide, compelling nonsuicidal people to undergo psychiatric evaluations, or prompting arrests or shootings.

And, they said, it is unclear whether the company's approach is accurate, effective or safe. Facebook said that, for privacy reasons, it did not track the outcomes of its calls to police. And it has not disclosed exactly how its reviewers decide whether to call emergency responders. Facebook, critics said, has assumed the authority of a public health agency while protecting its process as if it were a corporate secret.

""It's hard to know what Facebook is actually picking up on, what they are actually acting on, and are they giving the appropriate response to the appropriate risk,"" said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ""It's black box medicine.""

Facebook said it worked with suicide prevention experts to develop a comprehensive program to quickly connect users in distress with friends and send them contact information for help lines. It said experts also helped train dedicated Facebook teams, who have experience in law enforcement and crisis response, to review the most urgent cases. Those reviewers contact emergency services only in a minority of cases, when users appear at imminent risk of serious self-harm, the company said.

""While our efforts are not perfect, we have decided to err on the side of providing people who need help with resources as soon as possible,"" Emily Cain, a Facebook spokeswoman, said in a statement.

In a September post, Facebook described how it had developed a pattern recognition system to automatically score certain user posts and comments for likelihood of suicidal thoughts. The system automatically escalates high-scoring posts, as well as posts submitted by concerned users, to specially trained reviewers.

""Facebook has always been way ahead of the pack,"" said John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, ""not only in suicide prevention, but in taking an extra step toward innovation and engaging us with really intelligent and forward-thinking approaches."" (Vibrant Emotional Health, the nonprofit group administering the Lifeline, has advised and received funding from Facebook.)

Facebook said its suicide risk scoring system worked worldwide in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic -- except for in the European Union, where data protection laws restrict the collection of personal details like health information. There is no way of opting out, short of not posting on, or deleting, your Facebook account.

A review of four police reports, obtained by The Times under Freedom of Information Act requests, suggests that Facebook's approach has had mixed results. Except for the Ohio case, police departments redacted the names of the people flagged by Facebook.

In one case in May, a Facebook representative helped police officers in Rock Hill, South Carolina, locate a man who was streaming a suicide attempt on Facebook Live. On a recording of the call to the police station, the Facebook representative described the background in the video -- trees, a street sign -- to a police operator and provided the latitude and longitude of the man's phone.

The Police Department credited Facebook with helping officers track down the man, who tried to flee and was taken to a hospital.

""Two people called the police that night, but they couldn't tell us where he was,"" said Courtney Davis, a Rock Hill police telecommunications operator, who fielded the call from Facebook. ""Facebook could.""

The Police Department in Mashpee, Massachusetts, had a different experience. Just before 5:16 a.m. Aug. 23, 2017, a Mashpee police dispatcher received a call from a neighboring Police Department about a man who was streaming his suicide on Facebook Live. Officers arrived at the man's home a few minutes later, but by the time they got to him, he no longer had a pulse, according to police records.

At 6:09 a.m., the report said, a Facebook representative called to alert police to the suicide threat.

Scott W. Carline, chief of the Mashpee Police Department, declined to comment. But he said of Facebook, ""I'd like to see them improve upon the suicide prevention tools they have in place to identify warning signs that could potentially become fatal.""

Facebook's Cain said that, in some cases, help unfortunately did not arrive in time. ""We really feel for those people and their loved ones when that occurs,"" she said.

The fourth case, in May 2017, involved a teenager in Macon, Georgia, who was streaming a suicide attempt. Facebook called police after officers had already found the teenager at her home, a spokeswoman for the Bibb County sheriff's office said. The teen survived the attempt.

Some health researchers are also trying to predict suicide risk, but they are using more transparent methodology and collecting evidence on the results.

The Department of Veterans Affairs has developed a suicide risk prediction program that uses AI to scan veterans' medical records for certain medicines and illnesses. If the system identifies a veteran as high risk, the VA offers mental health appointments and other services. Preliminary findings from a VA study reported fewer deaths overall among veterans in the program compared with nonparticipating veterans.

In a forthcoming article in a Yale law journal, Mason Marks, a health law scholar, argues that Facebook's suicide risk scoring software, along with its calls to police that may lead to mandatory psychiatric evaluations, constitutes the practice of medicine. He says government agencies should regulate the program, requiring Facebook to produce safety and effectiveness evidence.

""In this climate in which trust in Facebook is really eroding, it concerns me that Facebook is just saying, 'Trust us here,'"" said Marks, a fellow at Yale Law School and New York University School of Law.

Facebook's Cain disagreed that the program amounted to health screening. ""These are complex issues,"" she said, ""which is why we have been working closely with experts."""

RESTRICTING BANKS

Following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, Warren emerged as a leading critic of Wall Street and continues to advocate for stiffer regulation and oversight, including reinstating a rule that would separate banks' retail business from their riskier investment banking activities.

Warren, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, has fought the Trump administration's efforts to weaken post-crisis financial rules, going as far as to attack moderate Democrats who backed a May rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank reform law.

In a September interview marking 10 years since the financial crisis, Warren was asked about breaking up big banks. ""Oh yeah,"" she told the New York Times. ""Give me a chance.""

She also has opposed the administration's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency she helped create, and has pressured the Federal Reserve to take a tough line on scandal-hit lender Wells Fargo & Co <WFC.N>.

Many of Warren's policy positions have focussed on economic inequality. She recently offered legislation calling on the U.S. government to manufacture generic drugs to reduce their cost. In 2017, she joined other senators in a proposal to extend the federal Medicare health insurance programme for seniors to include everyone.

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel dismissed her as ""another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.""

Warren's 80 percent name recognition does not translate into actual support, University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato said.

Warren will begin campaigning soon in some of the states with early presidential nominating contests, a person familiar with her plans said.

Trump's use of Pocahontas, a 17th century Native American woman associated with the British colony in Jamestown, Virginia, was aimed at drawing attention to a controversy over her heritage raised during Warren's 2012 Senate race.

Warren in October released a DNA analysis she said supported her assertion that she had Native American lineage.

Trump's reference has drawn criticism from some Native American groups, while others criticized Warren for trying to lay claim to a tribal heritage.

The Ahmedabad Police Department has new plans for the new year. Among the many safety and awareness projects, the city police will give more prominence to women's safety, improving road infrastructure, and traffic maintenance.

Other areas of focus will include introducing new surveillance and security equipment along with automation. The police aim to ease road traffic this year.

While speaking to DNA, Police Commissioner AK Singh said that nearly 20 projects will be launched while traffic, infrastructure issues will be handled with a new approach.

The Ahmedabad Police Department will expand its traffic management capacity using a more systematic and policy-based structure for the same rather than using muscle power alone. In 2018, the police collected around Rs 35 cr spot fine from traffic offenders. The system of fine-collection will be automated this year. The Central Road Research Institute (CRRI) will study the city's road movement and its faulty infrastructure. Identified spots will be improved and sorted accordingly. For example, some of the major junctions located on the SG highway lane will be reworked and infrastructural change will be undertaken to reduce traffic congestion and ensure fast traffic movement on the lanes.

The city police department's New Year's gift to self will include 100 new PCR vehicles this year. The vehicles will also work as Abhayam vehicles with facilities for female and child victims. Every vehicle will have a women police official. All police vehicles will have Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras which will recognise traffic offenders and will issue challans too. The 1,006 CCTV cameras that are installed will be upgraded to automatically capture photos of those driving without helmets. Traffic cops will get over 500 mobile devices which will enable them to issue challans to traffic offenders and to detect repeat offenders and track their pending challans. Officers will also be able to collect fine online and by card payment. Every police station will have the capacity to take cyber complaints so that complainants can approach the nearest police station rather than going all the way to the Cyber Cell police station.

There are a total of 48 police stations in Ahmedabad of which only two are women's police stations right now. But that is set to change this year as all 48 police stations will have a desk of female police staff dedicated to helping female victims. Two single spot-rise response centres for women will also be built, one on the eastern side and the other on the western side. The centres will be equipped to provide shelter and medical aid. The city will also get two cyber cell police stations for women which it will be located at the existing women's police stations. The women cyber cell police stations will be equipped to deal with the cyber-related complains."

In 2019, my personal journey will continue: I am training harder -- and smarter -- than ever, looking forward to more titles and medals as we approach the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But there are larger uncertainties and questions: What can we do to encourage more women across all spheres, especially in sports? How can India give its best-ever performance at the Olympics? What is it that young girls and women across the nation can learn from my struggles and successes?

Let's first talk about India's prospects at international sports meets in general, with an eye on Tokyo in particular. The first thing sports, particularly those which centre around individual achievement, (and not just the one team game that draws so much attention and resources) needs is more funding. Funds are the first step towards building the infrastructure and expertise that can recognise, nurture and maintain the excellence that is required to perform at the highest level. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), for instance, mandates that schools have a certain infrastructure, that every child in India has access to specific facilities close to their home, in their own locality.

We can look at China and the difference that sports facilities have made to their performance at the international level. What is needed is an SSA-like scheme for sports. All children enjoy playing, and it is this joy that turns into grit and determination. With every child guaranteed the right facilities, they can learn to play and be recognised if they have an aptitude for a particular game at an early age. I remember in my own school days, I began with teaspoon-races and three-legged races! Every game counts. Today, my own children are always playing, they love it and along with their studies, it forms an important part of their overall development.

It is also important for there to be complete coordination between the government and sports federations and unity even within the sports federations themselves. The government, of course, is already doing a lot for sports and its growth. Under the Target Olympic Podium (TOP) scheme, which was instituted by the current NDA government in September 2014, the government is investing considerable funds in promoting talent. To provide an impetus towards an athlete's training, facilities, coaching et al is provided, along with a stipend of Rs 50,000. This is not a small amount. I never earned that much even when I had a government job!

Advertising

In the new year, we must ask for efficiency and accountability not only from the government and sports authorities, but also from the athletes themselves. In a country like India, with limited resources, is it fair that even under-performing persons continue to get such a handsome allowance and facilities?

The stipends and facilities must be performance-linked in sports, as in any other field. This will have multiple positive effects. First, it will ensure that new talent among the younger generation also gets a fair chance and fresh blood is injected into the athlete pool in the country. Second, it will keep those who are receiving the facilities on their toes and not let any kind of lethargy or a lackadaisical attitude to set in. Third, even for those who lose their benefits, it will act as a motivating force for them to perform better.

Another aspect of sports in India that requires attention is the increasingly stellar performance of women. Women are now outperforming men in international events. Clearly, this is an area that the government, as well as all other interested parties, should focus on. Developing the potential of India's girls and women will only lead to more international recognition, which in turn will fuel the growth of sports at home, creating a much-needed virtuous cycle.

In our society, women are often discouraged from performing multiple roles. But to the girls and women of India, I say that you should chase excellence and achievement. Age, marital status, region, religion -- none of this should stand in your way. After being married and having children, I continued to train -- and win -- at the highest level. This required a great effort on my part, I have learnt to listen to my body and mind and find people who when they work with me, understand my way of working. Whatever you do in life, these lessons are important. It is important to step out of the home and follow your dreams and passions. Achievement can only come through hard work. We all have to give ourselves the opportunity to do that work, only then can we scale new heights.

I come from a relatively small community, one which is not particularly wealthy or powerful even in my home state. Yet, today, because of my achievements, I am a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. I am truly grateful for this opportunity. I can turn to the most powerful and popular people, and tell them with pride that my achievements, my Olympic medal, world championships and all the other titles, are because of hard work and dedication.

In the next year, there will be a general election, which is important for the entire country. My only wish is that it be a fair election, a free one where the will of the people is clearly expressed. After the people elect a government, it must work for the development of the entire nation, as I am sure it will endeavour to do.

I hope that in 2019, I continue to do India proud on the global stage and there are others who are inspired to do the same in all walks of life."

They got together, cleaned and repainted the school, and also installed new green boards in the classrooms.

Speaking about the initiative, V Kamalesh, 24, who studied in the school from 1999 to 2003, said they had formed a volunteer forum called 'Young Heartz' through which they do philanthropic activities every New Year. ""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

Headmistress C Rajam said the school now has 121 students in five classes. ""The numbers have fallen by 50 to 60 after 2001, as this is a Tamil medium school and people are after English medium schools. But our school has a trackrecord of inculcating values along with education,"" she said. ""In 2017, I was honoured with the Dr Radhakrishnan Award for the best teacher in recognition of the school's service to students.""

Alumni too vouch for the school's legacy. ""Most of the people from the area would have done their primary schooling here and now they are in several respectable positions,"" said Kamalesh.

The youngsters plan to buy new furniture for the school and will soon start collecting funds for it."

For the New Year's Eve special, Skip joins the list of numerous artistes who will perform at various outlets of Social.

Skip started out as a child who enjoyed listening to Bollywood music. With a limited exposure on hand, he started exploring English music when he was in class 10. ""There was a music competition in school and we were required to sing some English song. So, my father got cassettes of the popular bands, including Boyzone and Backstreet Boys.

It was only later on that I started listening to diverse forms of music,"" shares Skip, who feels that the challenges he faced were the same as any offbeat career id at that time. ""Initially, I didn't receive much support to become a DJ. But as people started recognising me with a few articles in newspapers, things started getting better. What kept me going all this while, was the never-ending support from my family. Once they knew I was serious about becoming a DJ, they fully supported me,"" he says.

Being one of the very few DJs who took part in competitions with a pair of turntables and mixer, Skip was the national winner of the Red Bull Thre3Style contest in 2011 and 2012. He later went to Chicago to represent India for the finale. ""It's hard to really practice and come up with routines when you have nobody else to practice with. 2012 was definitely the year that changed my career for sure. The trip to Chicago, seeing the World Finalists in action and the amount of practice they put in to get perfection made me realise that nothing is impossible and I can achieve the same if I practice enough,"" he shares.

With DJing is gaining recognition as a viable career option, technology too has been helping the industry to develop further. The rising number of DJs and the growing interest of producers and live performances, Skip believes that technology has played a big part in the growth. ""It is not only the audio that has advanced, artists can incorporate visuals in their routines and give the consumers an audiovisual experience, too,"" shares Skip, adding that the audience is opening up to different styles of music.

However, he points out that not everything is as green as it appears. ""What I have noticed over the years is that technology is making DJs very lazy. Rather than focusing on the various techniques of playing music, they are becoming more engrossed on how to look good on social media.""

Versatility in terms of music and showmanship are his USPs. And for his special gig, Skip is ready with his magic potion, a mix of new remixes while reminiscing the old days. ""Gigs at the Social are always super special because there's a different vibe. I am really excited that I am playing on the last day of the year.""

A big fan of Dragon Ball Z, Skip enjoys watching anime when not busy working. Other than that he also loves playing video games and Tekken is his all-time favourite. He also dedicates his time teaching young, aspiring talent by conducting DJ workshops at colleges and as a guest lecturer at SAE (School of Audio Engineering) Institute, Chennai.

Catch him live at Nehru Place Social today between 9 pm to 12 am. Live DJing is also scheduled at other outlets, including Hauz Khas Village Social, Odeon Social and Cyber Hub Social."

""A plate of bhelpuri. It contains contrasting elements but is simultaneously balanced. Full of surprises, it makes people happy,"" he says. And how accurate is he. Kochi-native Thomas of The Bombay Canteen, Kamala Mills, Mumbai, was in his hometown for Christmas. A long-standing tradition celebrated in style, Thomas did his part by roasting a duck he procured from Mumbai.

This year has been Thomas's year. The Bombay Canteen was voted India's best restaurant at the Condé Nast Traveller and Himalayan Sparkling Top Restaurant Awards. The chef himself has bagged Himalayan Sparkling Raw and Fine Chef of the Year for constantly reinventing Indian food by travelling to far-flung places in the country. Yet, the humble man talks about the milestone his restaurant achieved, over his own. ""What really made me happier was that our restaurant got voted the number one. A restaurant is a collective. Such recognition means a lot more for the team,"" he says.

Thomas's journey was lined with 'naadan' curries and French cheeses. His grandmother, fondly called 'Ammama' lit the stove, or rather, lay the foundations. ""She would perpetually be cooking at some point of the day and somehow everything she made brought a smile to peoples' faces. I was a witness to it and that got me hooked,"" the chef continues. When he turned 16, he expressed his desire to be a chef. Fortunately for him, and now for us, his parents agreed. That led to hotel management at the Welcomgroup Graduate School of Hotel Administration in Manipal, further which he flew to the US and tightened the strings of his apron at the prestigious Culinary Institute of America, Hyde Park, New York in 2007. ""Once I graduated, I applied to the best restaurants in the world. I was posted at La Bernardin, a three-star Michelin French restaurant in NYC, where I learnt from the best,"" he says.

After a year, Thomas decided to head back to his home country and began working at Olive Bar and Kitchen, Bandra, Mumbai. ""I grew from a cook to a chef. Somewhere along the way I realised that I had to travel and taste European cuisines,"" Thomas says. He set sail and took a four-month trip across France, Italy, and Spain. ""I had an epiphany on that trip. I realised how little I had done to explore my own cuisines,"" he continues. He then turned back and began looking at Indian food differently. The oven timer rang at the very instant, and he donned the chef hat at The Bombay Canteen. Nevertheless, Thomas is an honest man and having never cooked Indian food professionally, he felt he must travel across India to 'taste' authentic Indian food. The rest is (food)history.

""I found my career mission on that trip. I saw a whole different side of India and Indian food. I realised I wanted to bring misrepresented Indian food to people through my way of storytelling through social media. That's what we, The Bombay Canteen has done - showcase Indian food using local, seasonal ingredients in a fun way so people are excited about it and constantly keep coming back,"" he says. And how he does it. ""I immerse myself in local cuisines, cook with the locals, go to their homes, understand the foundations of those cuisines, the flavours, learn recipes, and they trigger new dishes at the restaurant thereby creating a backstory for every dish,"" he says.

And what he does see for the food industry in the future? ""What we know as fine-dining, stark white stiff tablecloth, where the service is plated beyond a point of recognition is going to be dissolved. Sustainability is going to be an important part of what we all care about. Indian food is going to be big in a big way- I'd like to call the Indian food movement and I'm happy to be leading the charge,"" he adds."

This comprises of 3,63,487 Individual and Group enterprises loans and 4,73,382 as SHG credit linkage accounts.

The Street Vendors Act, enacted in 2014, is an inclusive initiative aimed at protecting the livelihoods of street vendors, giving them representation in a decision-making body that regulates conditions related to vending, and most importantly, seeks to include them within the social security safety nets. The SUSV component of DAY-NULM is aimed at bringing formal recognition to street vendors, in line with the spirit of the Act. The survey for identification of street vendors has been completed in 2,322 cities; 16,89,564 street vendors have been identified and 8,18,095 vendors have been given ID cards.

Homeless persons are a particularly vulnerable section of the urban poor population, often facing extreme living conditions, malnutrition and other health issues, as well as exclusion from society. The SUH component aims to provide shelters equipped with basic amenities to provide dignified living conditions and connect them to available safety nets. The SUH guidelines make it mandatory for local municipal bodies to conduct systematic third-party surveys to assess accurately the need for shelters at locations close to places of natural congregation. 1,776 shelters for urban homeless have been sanctioned so far, to create capacity for 89,000 urban homeless persons, and 1,084 shelters are currently functional.

In a zero-tolerance campaign against drunk drivers and rogue bikers, special police teams will hit the streets as early as 4pm on Monday since the police feel that early deployment of cops had helped curb the menace during Christmas. In the two-day period, including Christmas day, 75 people were arrested for driving drunk. In 2017, the number was over 100 in the same period.

At least nine crossings -- including Park Street-Russell Street crossing, Park street-Chowringhee Road crossing and Mayo Road crossing -- have been identified where traffic officials will put up points to check drivers with breathalyzers. A detective department team in plain clothes -- specially tasked with prevention of drink-driving -- has already been deployed since Christmas.

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

He was 95. He died after suffering a heart attack at his residence in Bhowanipore area of the city. He is survived by his son Kunal. His wife, actor Geeta Sen, passed away last year.

With his demise, the Golden Age of Bengali Cinema came to an end -- an era defined by the famous trio -- Satyajit Ray, Ritwik Ghatak and Sen. Family members said Sen's body will be cremated on January 2 after his son and daughter-in-law return from the US on January 1. ""He died at around 10.35 am after suffering a cardio respiratory failure. His body will be kept in Peace World,"" Sen's family doctor told reporters.

Director Anjan Dutta, actress Mamata Shankar and others visitede Sen's house to pay their respects. The Padma Bhushan and Dadasaheb Phalke awardee was not keeping well for the last few years and had withdrawn from public life. Despite his poor health, Sen made a brief visit to the Kolkata International Film Festival in 2012.

A career spanning over six decades (1956-2002), Sen made 27 full-length feature films, 14 short films and four documentaries. Sen made his directorial debut with Raat Bhore in 1955. His second film, Neel Akasher Neechey, earned him local recognition, while his third film, Baishey Shraban gave him international exposure. He made a film with a shoe-string budget provided by the Government of India, Bhuvan Shome. This film also initiated the ""New Cinema"" film movement in India.

His other films such as Ekdin Pratidin, Akaler Sandhane and Khandhar earned him national award for best direction. He also won national award for the best feature film for Bhuvan Shome, Chorus, Mrigaya and Akaler Sandhane. His Calcutta trilogy -- Interview, Calcutta 71 and Padatik -- is considered a masterpiece that depicted the social and political upheavals during the '70s. Social crisis of the middle class has been a dominant theme in his films. A life-long believer in Marxism theories, Sen portrayed the emotions of the working class through his movies.

Jumpcut, montage, blackouts and point-of-view shots were some of the techniques which were a regular feature in his movies. Although most of his films were commercial flops, they won numerous awards around the world. During his career, Sen's films have received awards from almost all major film festivals, including Cannes, Berlin, Venice, Moscow, Karlovy Vary, Montreal, Chicago, and Cairo. His 1982 Bengali film Kharij won the jury prize at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.

Along with his contemporaries -- Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak -- Sen was one of the greatest ambassadors of Bengali parallel cinema on the global stage and belonged to the Golden Age of Bengali Cinema. Condoling the death of the veteran filmmaker, West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi said, ""Mrinal sen, a Padma Bhushan and Dada Saheb Phalke awardee, along with his contemporaries Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak paved the way for parallel cinema in the country with gems like Mrigaya, Ek Din Achanak, Bhuban Som, Padatik, Akaler Sandhane. His cinema is known for artistic depiction of social reality. His death is an irreparable loss to creative Indian cinema.""

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee took to Twitter to condole his death. ""Saddened at the passing away of Mrinal Sen. A great loss to the film industry. My condolences to his family,"" she tweeted. ""My almost 60-year-long association with him ended today. I am devastated by his death,"" said veteran actor Soumitra Chatterjee. Actress and dancer Mamata Shankar, who made her cinematic debut in Sen's Mrigaya, said, ""What I am today is because of Mrinal Da. I have lost my father today.""

Actor Mithun Chakraborty, who also made his debut in the same film and won a national award, in a number of occasions described Sen as his ""godfather"". Filmmaker Gautam Ghosh said Sen's films must be restored for the future generation. ""I met him a fortnight ago and he was in a jovial mood. Today he is no more. A legend has departed who taught us not to compromise with anything while making movies... The state government should preserve and restore his films. This will be a fitting tribute to him,"" Ghosh said.

Sen was born on May 14, 1923, in Faridpur, now in Bangladesh. After finishing high school there, he came to Calcutta as a student. He studied physics at Scottish Church College and subsequently earned a postgraduate degree at the University of Calcutta. As a student, he got involved with the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India. Although he never became a member of the party, his association with the socialist Indian People's Theatre Association brought him close to a number of like-minded culturally associated people.

In 1982 he was a member of the jury at the 32nd Berlin International Film Festival. In 1983, he was a member of the jury at the 13th Moscow International Film Festival. In 1997, he was a member of the jury at the 20th Moscow International Film Festival. He made his final feature film, Aamaar Bhuvan, in 2002. He was a member of the Rajya Sabha from 1998 to 2003."

Mrinal Sen, who died in Kolkata on Sunday morning, was a true Bengali. He was as passionate about cinema as he was about politics and football and food. And as a true Bengali, he spoke animatedly and with profound sense. He would sometimes hold my hand with the fondness of an elder brother and talk about his own cinema, and about the cinema others made. Living just 15 minutes walking distance away from his South Kolkata home, I would often spend hours with him over endless cups of steaming hot chai in rapt attention. He was never boring, he hardly ever repeated himself and my attention could never waver. That was Mrinal Babu for many of us.

The one other city where I met him apart from my own Kolkata - where I grew up, went to school and college and had my initiation in journalism at The Statesman - was Cannes. This was much later in my life, when I had left Kolkata for Chennai and The Hindu. He was getting on in years, and needed help to walk, and spotting me at a press conference - which must have been quite easy being the only brown guy among a sea of white journalists - he asked me to take him around. We walked a bit on the legendary Croisette, Cannes' beach front, along a path that many celebrities must have gone by. Why, I am told Prince Rainier and the Hollywood beauty, Grace Kelly, had once walked hand in hand on the Croisette - as I did with Mrinal Babu, who needed a hand to keep himself steady.

Interestingly, Sen had four of his movies presented at Cannes (Satyajit Ray had seven) Ek Din Pratidin in 1980 Competition; Kharij in 1983 Competition, which won the Jury Prize; Khandhar in 1984 A Certain Regard (and which was shown in 2010 as part of Cannes Classics) and Genesis (1986 Competition). I was part of the audience which watched a brand new print of Khandhar, and the auditorium was packed, and stood up at the end to applaud a master moviemaker.

Sen's career in cinema began many decades before 2010. He made his first film in 1955, Raat Bhore, with Uttam Kumar (who went on to become an iconic star in Bengal). But the movie crashed. Sen's next outing, Neel Akasher Neechey, won him local applause, while his third feature, Baishey Shravan, gave him international recognition.

But it was 1969 and Bhuvan Shome that catapulted Sen to dizzying heights. That year, along with Mani Kaul (with his Uski Roti) and Basu Chatterjee (Sara Aakash), Sen's Bhuvan Shome heralded what came to be termed New Wave. In the next few years, this phenomenal Wave caught on with some brilliant works emerging - Pattabhi Rama Reddy's Samskara, Adoor Gopalakrishnan's Swayamvaram, Kumar Sahani's Maya Darpan, Awtar Krishna Kaul's 27 Down, MS Sathyu's Garam Hawa and Shyam Benegal's Ankur.

Bhuvan Shome was a poignant narration of an elderly ticket-examiner's life as a widower, and how his principled existence changes after he goes on a hunting expedition to Gujarat, where he meets Gauri (a young and pretty Suhasini Mulay). One of the earliest works to have been funded by the National Film Development Corporation of India, Bhuvan Shome Or Mr Shome - which can be seen as having parallels with Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game - was a classic study of how a stiff, rather well-to-do gentleman is tutored by a village belle, rustic and, well, romantic. After his disastrous bird hunting venture, Shome (played by Utpal Dutt with singular brilliance) is a completely transformed man.

Sen, who was born on May 14, 1923, at Faridpur, now in Bangladesh (and he would get very nostalgic when he reminisced about his home), left for what was then Calcutta to study physics at the well known Scottish Church College, and later his Masters at Calcutta University. His love for cinema tumbled out of a heap of books on movie aesthetics, and his job as a technician in a film studio finally pushed him behind the camera. Interestingly, his association with the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India rubbed off on some of his movies.

His 1971 Interview (where Ranjit Mallick first appeared on screen) was path-breaking. Its style and technique were innovative, and with the plot touching upon facets like anti-establishment, unemployment and middle class cowardice, Interview had strong political undertones.

The following year, Sen crafted Calcutta 71 (the second of his Calcutta trilogy along with Padatik), which was even more political. Through a bunch of four stories, Sen depicted with all their brutality, the Naxalite movement, hunger among the common people and the poisonous social as well political corruption. It was a strong indictment of the ruling class.

Even more disturbing was Sen's Akaler Shandhaney - where a cinema crew travels to a village to recreate the 1943 Bengal Famine (man made and which killed five million Bengalis). As the crew tries to document the tragic suffering, a strange mix of the past and the present begins to unfold, and with two excellent performers - Smita Patil and Dhrtiman Chatterjee - the film remains etched in memory.

Some of Sen's later works wandered away from the political path towards more personal kind of subjects. Ek Din Pratidin narrates the story of a young girl (Mamata Shankar) from a middle class family who fails to return home one night, and her parents worry because some harm might have befallen her, and that her absence might worsen their own economic suffering. Here, Sen underlines the selfishness that often mar intimate relationships.

In Khandhar, a mother waits for a man who had promised to marry her daughter (Shabana Azmi), but when he fails to turn up, three friends who are passing by take pity on the old woman, and one of them agrees to wed the young girl. The mother dies happy that her daughter had found a companion, but the men leave.

Sen's last work in 2002, Aamar Bhuvan (with Nandita Das) was yet another take on disillusionment and deceit. Certainly not in the league of his earlier films, perhaps age and ill-health taking a toll on his creative abilities, Aamar Bhuvan sank without much ado.

The monthly average income of farmers remains one of the lowest in the country at '1,407 per family. As per the 70th report of National Sample Survey (NSS), except West Bengal where monthly income of a farmer's family remains '979, all other states are way ahead of Odisha.

'16,765 cr Agri Budget

Despite enhanced allocation of '16,765 crore for agriculture and allied sectors in 2018-19, which is more than double from last fiscal, contribution of agriculture to Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) has declined to 20 per cent over an extended period, but it still supports 50 per cent of the State's population.

Legendary filmmaker Mrinal Sen, who paved the way for parallel cinema in India, passed away on Sunday morning at 10:30am at his Bhowanipore residence in Kolkata. He had been suffering from a heart ailment for a while. His death marks the end of an era in Bengali cinema.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed her condolences and tweeted, ""Saddened at the passing away of Mrinal Sen. A great loss to the film industry. My condolences to his family.""

Born in 1923 in Bangaldesh's Faridpur, Sen moved to Kolkata after high school, and graduated from Scottish Church college. As a student, he was involved with the cultural wing of the Communist Party of India.

In 1955, he began his directorial career with the film Raat Bhor, starring Uttam Kumar, who was yet to become a star. Neel Akasher Neeche was his next film. He earned international acclaim with the film Baishe Shrabon (the date of Rabindranath Tagore's death).

Bhuvan Shome, which was released in 1969, won the National Film Award for Best Direction and National Film Award for Best Feature Film. It launched him as a force to reckon with in Indian cinema, and won him international recognition as well.

Sen was a contemporary of Satyajit Ray and Ritwik Ghatak. His films were harsh critiques of the Indian society and raised difficult questions. Mrigayaa (1976), which marked the debut of Bollywood star Mithun Chakraborty, was an attempt to expose how people of tribal origins are exploited by landlords in rural India.

Sen left his mark among international audiences too, with his films being screened at major film festivals around the world. In 1983, he won the Cannes Film Festival - Jury Prize for Kharij.

In 1981, the Government of India awarded Sen with the Padma Bhushan. The Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest honour given to an Indian filmmaker, was awarded to him for the year 2003. In 2017, Sen was was inducted as a member of the Oscar Academy."

Here are the highlights of 2018 Breaking Tradition

One of the biggest annual events in the cultural calendar of Pune is the Sawai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, which takes place in December each year and sees stalwarts of Hindustani music from across the world perform. The audience is equally diverse. Breaking from tradition, this year the organisers of the festival announced, at the last minute, that the venue for the festival -- which has been the New English School Ramanbaug grounds for over 30 years -- has been changed to a much farther location as the school authorities cancelled the permission. Local civic authorities jumped in to help by announcing more bus routes to the new venue and clearing other approvals.

Leading Protests

Pune is often referred to as the cultural capital of Maharashtra, with an abundance of theatre, music, literature and film presence in the city. One of its most iconic venues is the Balgandharva Rangmandir. Among the oldest auditoriums in the city, it occupies an important place in the sociocultural fabric of Pune. As the PMC announced plans to redevelop the five-decade-old auditorium, theatre exponents and activists such as filmmaker Amol Palekar led protests questioning the intent behind the move. Currently, the plan has been stalled.

Another incident when Pune theatres made national news was when a few Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers barged into a PVR cinema hall and hit an assistant manager, over arguments of

high prices of food. The incident led to nationwide debates.

Revisiting History

This year, one of the important events in theatre in Pune was the revival of the iconic play Mahanirvan, by playwright Satish Alekar. The two-part Marathi play was originally written in 1974, and is considered one of the finest pieces of artistic craftsmanship. It has been translated in over a dozen languages and has inspired several theatre groups and plays across the country. This year, after a gap of nearly ten years, Alekar returned to the stage with the play, albeit with a new cast.

Advertising Gaining Recognition

A collaboration of five artists, led by visual artist Raju Sutar, became part of an official collateral exhibition at the prestigious Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Textile artist Vaishali Oak became the only participant from India to showcase at the 10th International Fiber Art Biennale in Beijing, in mid-October.

Another important event in theatre was the completion of a decade of the city-based Natak Company group, which has several members from the film and theatre industry, including Nipun Dharmadhikari, Amey Wagh and Siddharth Menon.

Litterateurs, writers and sociologists from 140 countries were part of the 84th PEN International Congress that was hosted by the Savitribai Phule Pune University. The meet focussed on critical situation for freedom of expression in India, representing voices of women in literature, among other issues.

Several Pune-based authors released books that made it to the bestseller lists. Notable among these were Sudha Menon's Feisty at Fifty, Manjiri Prabhu's Voice

of the Runes, and Deepak Dalal's The Paradise Flycatcher.

Filmmakers from Pune also won accolades. At the National Film Awards, Prasad Pal's directorial debut Kaccha Limbu won the Best Film award and Nipun Dharmadhikari's Dhappa bagged the Nargis Dutt Award for Best Film on National Integration. Mhorkya received the Special Mention Award and Best Children's Film and Nagraj Manjule got the Best Director Award for the non-feature

films category."

As a new guard -- a bunch of young and largely self-taught filmmakers -- takes over its mantle, what does it mean for the 83-year-old Assamese film industry?

In 1935, when poet and playwright Jyoti Prasad Agarwala finished making Joymoti, the film premiered not in Assam but in Bengal's Rownac Hall in Calcutta. There were no film theatres in Assam to screen what is famous today as the first ever Assamese film, the one that heralded the humble beginnings of a film industry in Assam.

Cut to 2018, Assamese cinema, an industry that is now more than eighty years old, came under the spotlight after several years of being in the shade. The film that almost made it to the Oscars 2019, Village Rockstars, brought the focus back on an industry that was once known for its languid, beautiful storytelling but had, over recent decades, witnessed a lull.

While it would premature to point at any solid trends of resurgence, the success of Village Rockstars got a conversation started. ""I won't call this a wave -- but it is certainly a beginning or an indication of a wave,"" says filmmaker Utpal Borpujari, whose film Ishu, bagged the National Award for the Best Assamese Film in 2018. While Ishu is a children's' movie, it deals with the very somber problem of witch-hunting in Assam.

In the past few years, it's socially relevant topics like these -- closely entwined with the human emotion -- that are slowly seeping back into Assamese films. Among them are Xoixobote Dhemalite (2018) by Bidyut Kotoky, Alifa by Deep Choudhury (2018), Boga Khirkee (2018) by Jahnu Barua or even Haanduk (2016) by young Tinsukia-based filmmaker, Jaicheng Jai Dohutia -- all compassionate films set in the backdrop of strife and violence.

""Assamese cinema has passed through many shades of light, both dark and bright,"" writes Bobeeta Sharma in her book The Moving Image and Assamese Culture. ""Assamese films became a popular source of entertainment in the 1950s, 60s and 70s.""

Till the 1960s, writes Sharma, Assamese films were characterised by themes that were socially relevant. Filmmaking was not a purely commercial venture, it had a sense of social responsibility as well.

In the 1980s, there came a gradual decline in their popularity.

""Made with meagre budgets, they naturally could not attract audiences. Assamese films began to become bad copies of Bollywood films,"" Sharma says.

Things took a turn for the worse in the past decade.

""In the past decade, the filmmaking style was not up to date with the rest of the world -- the dialogues were too verbose, the cinematic language was not strong,"" says Borpujari, ""Even the commercial blockbusters of the early 2000s vanished.""

In 2015, hundreds of actors, directors, technicians and producers from the Assamese film fraternity even observed a ""Day of Solidarity"" for the ""revival of Assamese cinema"" in Guwahati's Dighalipukhuri area highlighting the apathy of the state government towards the industry.

Borpujari adds that independent cinema had practically no space to grow in Assam. ""Only when a film got recognition in the form of a National Award, then people noticed it,"" he says

THE NEW GUARD

In February 2018, a little-known film called Calendar released across theatres in Assam. The premise followed the simple story of a small town family in Assam, and did unexpectedly well (it ran for three weeks) throughout the state. The filmmaker, 33-year-old Himjyoti Talukdar from Biswanath Chariali, says Calendar isn't ""an easy film to club.""

It was low budget, rich in content, and ""non-masala"", and yet commercially successful -- an anomaly in the current times for cinema in Assam. ""Content rich cinema and commercially successful. We usually separate the two but it can happen,"" says Talukdar.

While the commercial success of Calendar was an exception, its treatment and topic, is congruent with several recent Assamese films. Says filmmaker Borpujari, ""And these are by a new crop of filmmakers -- they are young, fresh and are making films that are cinematically strong.""

These new faces -- both men and women -- are between the ages of 30 and 40, hail from various parts of Assam, and shoot on shoestring, and often crowdsourced, budgets.

Growing up in Biswanath Chariali, about 200 km from Guwahati, Reema Borah, director of the critically-acclaimed film Bokul, says ""For me, being in films was a distant dream -- we knew of only a few filmmakers.""

However, Borah, in 2007, pursued her dream of filmmaking and graduated from the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. Similarly, Anupam Koushik Bordoloi, who hails from the riverine island of Majuli, ventured out to study at the National School of Drama, Delhi, the first person from his hometown to do so. In September, his film Bornodi Bhotiai, a beautiful, slow-paced film on the ""real Majuli"" opened to packed audiences at the MAMI festival.

""When we graduated, we had no connection to Assam. Then I thought -- 'it's high time, I need to make a film for my people',"" says Borah, adding that how experiences of growing up in a ""troubled region"" inevitably finds its way back in creative expression. ""It all comes out in the our movies: our struggles, our fears, our crisis, our identity,"" she says.

Borah who made Bokul is almost done with her new film Noi, about a fisherman who stumbles upon a dead body. ""But I am not sure I want to even consider a theatrical release. First of all you need a lot of money for that, then there's the promotion. Moreover, it's a movie meant for only a certain kind of audience,"" says Borah, who is happy to screen in colleges, auditoriums or ""anywhere people would like to see it.""

These young directors often find space in film festivals -- both in the country and abroad -- and in Assam too, where the last few years have seen a spurt in their numbers be it small or big, government or private: Guwahati International Film Festival, Brahmaputra Valley Film Festival to smaller ones like Adda and the student-organised Jonaki film festival.

CROWDFUNDING

While lack of money is an issue most of these young filmmakers face, they often look to crowdfund their films. In 2014, Bhaskar Hazarika crowdfunded 22 lakhs for his film Kothanodi on Wishberry -- next year the film won a National Award. This set the trend.

While Borah tried to crowdfund for Bokul through Facebook, 33-year-old filmmaker Dhrubojyoti Bordoloi, says he ultimately ended up self-funding (Rs 6-7 lakhs) his film Dooroni Nirolar Proja (2017), set in hometown in Dhekiajuli. ""Crowdfunding might not work every time.If you have personal contacts, it helps -- for example, the musician might say he won't charge,"" he says.

Actor Adil Husain, who despite big ticket Hindi films, is known (through his roles) to support regional cinema, says, ""More and more people have chosen to become courageous, to explore this medium, to go out of Assam. When I grew up in Assam, everyone wanted to be a doctor or an engineer. Those who dreamt differently were considered outcastes.""

CARRYING ON

The last two years have seen the return of some of Assam's critically acclaimed filmmakers from the 1990s. Director Santwana Bordoloi's Maj Rati Keteki (2017) -- which is also available on Netflix -- a story about a writer who returns to his hometown after years, was her second film after two decades. In October, Jahnu Barua's Bhoga Khirkee, premiered at the 2nd Guwahati International Film Festival.

While Maj Rati Keteki had a good run, for other movies, it's usually a poor show. ""I didn't get half my money back for my first movie,"" says filmmaker Bordoloi, who spent seven years in Mumbai to learn the art before returning to Assam in 2014 to make Dooroni Nirolar Proja. ""I realised one needed to stay here to make a film viable. So I always wanted to come back,"" says Bordoloi, who is now based in small town Dhekiajuli. His next film Kokaideo Bindaas, about two brothers on a road trip, is set to release in February.

Most filmmakers feel that the real challenge comes after the film is made: promotion, release etc. ""But Village Rockstars changed the scene,"" says filmmaker Talukdar, adding that the movie has given young filmmakers like himself to the confidence to carry on.

While Borah's Bokul -- which was screen independently in a few colleges and an auditorium in Assam -- never hit the theatres (due to lack of funds), other independent cinema, like Kenny Basumatary's, have seen some amount of box office success.

Basumatary -- whose ""martial arts comedy film"" Local Kung Fu was one of the first 'indie' Assamese films to attract national attention back in 2012 -- feels that all films in Assam are, in some way or the other, ""independent"". ""There are no big studio set ups here. So we can't call some films independent, and the others not. The right categories would be small-budget and big budget,"" says the 37-year-old.

Advertising

In 2012, Basumatary made Local Kung Fu on a budget of Rs 95,000. Local Kung Fu 2 followed in a sequel in 2016, shot on a crowd-funded budget of eight lakh. The latest one, Suspended Inspector Bodo, is a serious action film hit the screens on December 7. ""This time we had a producer,"" he says."

When they do not fall into the socially prescribed narrative of 'good kids', we try to 'fix them' by criticising, complaining, shaming and blaming them. And when they push back in frustration, we react with anger and censure.

Rahil's mother was very upset with him. ""He is rude, aggressive, and of late, he has also started lying to us. If I try to scold him, he answers back or just walks out of the room. There is no respect for us."" Rahil sat sullenly looking at the floor and refusing to make any eye contact. I checked with him if I could spend some time alone with him and after some reluctance, he agreed. After a while, I asked him what he thought the problem was. He was quiet for a while and then said, ""Nothing I do is good enough for my parents. They are constantly comparing me to my older brother who is good in studies. In school, my teachers are always criticising me. I don't think anybody likes me.""

He sat twisting his hands, fighting back his tears, sharing his pain of hurt and rejection.

We all have a deep desire for perfect kids as that would, in turn, make us feel good about ourselves. When they do not fall into the socially prescribed narrative of 'good kids', we try to 'fix them' by criticising, complaining, shaming and blaming them. And when they push back in frustration, we react with anger and censure.

Our relationship with our children is like an emotional bank account -- we make deposits but we also make withdrawals. The deposits are in the form of spending time, playing, chatting, hugging, cuddling, words of recognition, making them feel special by doing things for them and so on, whereas the withdrawals could be criticism, comparison, shaming, blaming, complaining, hitting, abusing etc. Now in most homes, some withdrawals are inevitable as we all are human and will end up withdrawing unwittingly. However, it is only when the withdrawals outweigh the deposits that the emotional bankruptcy manifests in the form of aggressive behaviour, lying, stealing, rudeness, not listening etc. We are quick to label these 'behavioural problems' which needs 'disciplining' but we do little to understand the underlying emotions which might be causing them.

Advertising

There are some children who are more vulnerable to a higher level of 'withdrawal' from this emotional bank account - for example, children with learning difficulties, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), autism, or other disabilities. All these children are wired differently and do not fit the society's criteria of a 'good child'.

Then there are children who are emotionally intense and struggle to regulate their emotions or are going through difficult transitions in their life such as family conflicts, parents' divorce or childhood trauma. Sometimes it is very difficult for them to identify or express their feelings.

When I see my children being rude, it is very easy for me to blame them and difficult to look within and reflect on my emotional bank account, or what I call 'Connect', with them. If I am honest with myself, I invariably find that I have been preoccupied with some work, been snappy or just not been mindful of their presence.

Therefore, without realising, we end up feeding and energising the negativity in our children. Let's look at ways we can flip the energy and strengthen our Connect:

Acceptance

We all have a dream child in our mind and if our child does not match that, there could be feelings of disappointment and inadequacy -- ""I must be a bad parent, that's why my child is not good enough."" Children can pick up this feeling of ""not being good enough"" and react to it either by seeking approval, becoming withdrawn or just reacting with anger. Each child is wired differently and acceptance of that can be liberating for both the parent and the child. Can you imagine how wonderful it would be if every child got the message, ""I love you just the way you are. You are unique, you are different, you are you.""

Mindfulness

The greatest gift we can give our children in the present-day world is our attention. With our rushed lives, always running against time, our compulsion of checking our phones through the day, we do not have much time left for being really present for our kids. Mindfulness is about being in the here and now with our complete being - eye contact, full attention, relishing every moment of being with our kids.

Empathy

Kids want to do well, that is the way they are wired. However, when they face rejection or criticism, they give up and fight back. Once Rahil's mother started listening and empathising with Rahil, she noticed a tremendous change in him. He seemed much happier, willing to listen to her point of view and open to making changes. We have to work with our children and not against them.

Recognition

Rahil's parents had got into this negative pattern where they would notice everything he was doing wrong. They thought by calling out these behaviours, they would stop him from doing them, however, it actually worked the other way round. It made Rahil resentful and fight back, which, in turn, led to an impasse where both sides ended up feeling inadequate and frustrated and stuck in a vicious cycle. I suggested to them that instead, they could flip the energy and recognise every smallest thing he did well.

""I saw how you shared your chocolate with your brother; that was generous"", or ""I can see that you have put in a lot of effort in your homework today"".

I want to highlight that there is a difference between praise and recognition -- praise is like junk food which gives a quick high but does not have much nourishing value -- for example, ""You are so smart"", ""you are beautiful"". There is clear research evidence which indicates that what really works is recognition which is specific, focuses on a skill, something that you value in your child that you want to nurture - for example, hard work, honesty, generosity, compassion, kindness, grit etc.

Stories

The way we talk to our children becomes their inner voices and the way we talk about them become their life stories. These stories create their core identity and sometimes they start living according to them. Rahil's stories at home, extended family and school were that he was ""aggressive"", ""a liar"", ""lazy"". It took his parents and him time to change his stories around so that the other stories of being ""adventurous"", ""kind"", having ""leadership skills"" and being ""an out of the box thinker"" could emerge. As Rahil reauthored his stories, it restored his confidence and sense of agency on how he wanted to live his life. Last time I met him, he said with a big smile, ""I am the same person I was earlier but I see myself differently and so do other people.""

None of them, except Khurrana's character, have grey shades. They are ""protagonists"" in the true sense -- generally good guys whose battles are either internal or against the sociopolitical transgressions of a wider system. They can afford to position themselves as heroes: proverbial underdogs, passionate artists and lovers and athletes.

But what about the heroine? The pretty women who exist in context of the brave heroes -- is there such a thing anymore? As long as India's star-power culture is alive, there will be.

Note, in contrast, the five finest female performances of 2018. Alia Bhatt humanises the cold-blooded spy in Raazi; Tabu frightens as a manipulative murderess in Andhadhun; Taapsee Pannu is the mercurial small-town heartbreaker in Manmarziyaan; Radhika Apte is a study of new-age morality as a delusional teacher intellectualising her affair in Lust Stories; Anushka Sharma is hypnotic as the bloody-thirsty demon cursed with feelings in Pari.

These characters are not the most agreeable human beings. Three of them are killers -- of men, dogs, old ladies, but mostly men. The other two kill the idea of male agency -- Manmarziyaan's Rumi leaves in her indecisive wake the rubble of old-school romance. On the other hand, Kalindi's psychological toxicity in Lust Stories is destined to traumatise the boys she ensnares.

The Hindi film heroine has rebelled. In turn, the villain has disappeared. It's hard to pinpoint the exact moment the pink ribbon snapped: I suspect it was somewhere between the frustrating traditionalism of the Bhansali epic, the adventures of Kangana Ranaut, the fading star of the Khans and the half-written Ranbir Kapoor heroines. You could also connect this trend to the reverberations of the #MeToo movement, the monetisation of gender-inclusive storytelling, or the general democratisation of commercial filmmaking.

The result is the ""woman-oriented movie"": a term that, in most cases, is euphemism for the anti-heroine. The anti-heroine is, quite simply, the kind of girl that heroes' mommas have nightmares about. She doesn't have the time to be an underdog, athlete, artist, partner; love, too, only weakens her. Operating in a man's world has made her complex, strong, wrong and unapologetically volatile. Inspired by Vidya Bagchi in Kahaani, you see Raazi's Sehmat Khan and Andhadhun's Simi go one step further and thrive on the ""weaker sex"" label. They exploit the preconceived notions of the male gaze. Nobody is conditioned to expect a pregnant lady, fragile teenager or bored housewife to drive the plot of life.

When they do turn out to be ruthless and clever and homicidal, the surprise experienced by the men around them is weaponised by the movies that occupy them. It is then reflected in the surprise of the audience as well, seeing these particular actresses, many of whom have spent a major chunk of their professional careers playing the classic heroine, going grey -- which only adds to our inverted perception of their performance.

Perhaps it isn't surprising that it takes nothing less than a Hindi film actress to play the 'bad girl' today to arrest this nation's attention. It took the horrific actions of bad boys to trigger our damsel-in-distress radars and view women as survivors. This is just them amplifying the language of survival. Even in applauding them, we are in fact judging them. An analogy lies in the situation of Neena Gupta's Priyamvada in Badhaai Ho. She is invisible to the community as the timid 50-something woman conforming to the stereotypes of the aged heroine (obedient daughter-in-law, tender wife, indulgent mom) of the household. It isn't until she exhibits a semblance of sexuality by getting pregnant that the world gasps in recognition. Nobody bothered when she spent her adulthood propping up her husband's family, just like nobody bothers with the bland dutifulness of conventional heroines. Only when they transcend the plurality of Indian womanhood do they stand out. As cautionary tales. As individuals.

Some call it rebellion and others term it as living. Some call her the narrative device and others, the narrative. Heroines are a colourful manifestation of the movies, but anti-heroines are a sobering embodiment of life itself. The term ""anti-heroine,"" after all, is only euphemism for a woman."

Sandalwood has produced over 200 movies in 2018. Like every year, the success rate is less, but the industry should be happy to see that genuine attempts are being appreciated by the audience and our content is slowly crossing the borders. The industry is gaining some foothold in the US market and a few overseas countries, while KGF has got good recognition to the industry across the globe.

Among 200 odd movies, there are handful of movies which every cine-goer should watch not just to enjoy the film, but to get an idead about the progress Sandalwood has made in the recent years. Here, we have come up with the list of top 10 movies which the audience should not miss:

Gultoo: A new-age movie that deals with data theft and exposes the way our data is being mined for money. It tries to showcase how our every single moment is recorded and has a price on the internet. In short, the movie shows how technology can bring misery to our lives but doesn't take a stand whether tech is good or bad.

Katheyondu Shuruvagide: Senna Hegde's film came as a fresh breath of air. Packed with slice-of-the-life moments, the Diganth-starrer has a simple, yet a beautiful storyline.

Aa Karaala Ratri: Greed is destructive and it destroys everything. This is the underlining message of Dayal Padmanabhan's Aa Karaala Ratri, which starred JK aka Jayaram Karthik and Anupama Gowda. The film tells how money can make a good man an evil and lure him to do a crime.

KGF: Chapter 1: Yash and Prashanth Neel's KGF has turned out to be Sandalwood's pride. The movie is dubbed into Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Hindi and Malayalam languages and has become the talk of the nation. It is a period drama which tells the story of an ambitious man, who wants to become a rich and powerful person.

Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale, Kasaragod: Rishab Shetty's third directorial movie Sarkari Hiriya Prathamika Shale - Kasaragod (SHPSK) is a children's film, which portrays students struggle to save a government Kannada school from closure. The movie is centred around this issue and story is told with humour.

Ammachi Yemba Nenapu: Champa P Shetty's Ammachi Yemba Nenapu is about the patriarchal society where the men wield complete authority on women's lives. The movie has Raj B Shetty, Vyjayanti Adiga, Dr Radhakrishna Ural, Diya Palakkal and Deepika P Aradhya on lead roles, is based on Dr Vaidehi's short stories.

Churikatte: A crime story set in Malnad, it is about an aspiring cop trying to take on the timber mafia. The smart writing with strong performances from the cast makes it a must-watch film.

Tagaru: Duniya Soori's Tagaru, which had Shivaraj Kumar and Dhananjay in the leads, is a bloody battle between a daring cop and a ruthless rowdy. The non-linear narration, performance and songs struck the chord with viewers.

Raambo 2: Sharan's movies are mainly watched to get some good laughs and Raambo 2 successfully lives up to the viewers' expectations. But the movie has more to offer as it comes with a good message to the society.

The Villain: It is the first union (in full-fledged roles) of Sandalwood's heavy-weights Sudeep and Shivaraj Kumar. Kiccha's colourful avatars and acting, also the way Shivanna underplayed his role deserves huge applause. The story, though stretched to some extent, had enough twists and turns to keep the audience hooked."

Mayuresh Surnis is working on developing an instrument to search for fast radio burst (FRBs) at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in USA. He wants to write popular literature, especially in Marathi to help develop scientific temper and make people aware of the career opportunities in science.

Which college, course, and batch were you in? Tell us about your educational background

I did my primary schooling at the Hindustan Organic Chemicals (HOC) school in Rasayani, Raigad district. We moved to Pune in 2000 and I finished my Class X from New English School, Tilak road in 2003. I passed my higher secondary certificate exam from MES Abasaheb Garware College, Pune in 2005. I graduated with a bachelors degree in Physics from Fergusson College in 2008. After that, I continued for a master's in Physics (2010) at the Department of Physics, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU). I then joined the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA), Pune for a Ph D in Physics. I defended my thesis in January 2017 and was awarded the Ph D by the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai.

How were you in academics?

I was a bright student. I was consistently among the toppers in my class. I was ranked 4th in Raigad district in primary scholarship exam conducted by the Maharashtra Sate Board in 1997.

What drove you to chose this career path?

I was always interested in Science. I cannot pin point an exact moment but there were several instances which propelled me towards my goal. Popular science books were my biggest companions since childhood and I believe they had a huge impact on my career choice. Dr Jayant Naralikar and Dr Prakash Tupe are my favourite authors. Their books kindled my curiosity towards astronomy. It was my high school Science teacher, who truly inspired me to pursue a career in Science. She was a very good teacher and she explained the importance of scientists for the development of the society. Her encouragement gave me the confidence to take up science.

During my bachelors course, I became a member of the Astro Club in Fergusson College. This group was mentored by our professor Raka Dabhade. In Astro club, I came across many like minded classmates and seniors who were interested in astronomy. We used to have stimulating discussions, participate in science exhibitions in the college and interact with research fellows from IUCAA and NCRA. During one of those days, I got an opportunity to work with Govind Swarup, who is a pioneer of Radio Astrophysics in India. That was how I was introduced to National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA). I carried out my research projects at NCRA. This opportunity was unique in several ways. I got glimpses of the cutting edge research in astrophysics. I also got to know how professional researchers operate and learned a lot about radio astronomy. This exposure was enough for me to make a decision to pursue radio astronomy as a career.

What happened after graduation?

While pursuing my master's, I carried out a research project with Dr Bhal Chandra Joshi at NCRA. After I cleared the joint entrance screening test and interviews at NCRA, I decided to continued the research with him for Ph D.

Tell us about your career journey?

My career journey truly started with the opportunity to work in NCRA with Dr Govind Swarup. In this project, I got hands on experience with a small radio telescope to observe celestial objects. Radio telescopes are unique because they see a completely different picture of the universe, compared to the optical telescopes. This gave me a hang of what radio astronomy is and I decided to come back to NCRA for my masters project. During the masters project, I observed with a world class instrument, the ""Giant Metrewave Radio telescope (GMRT)"". In this project, we were searching for radio pulsars, the rotating neutron stars that emit radio pulses. I developed a keen interest in pulsar search and timing while working on this project. Meanwhile I cleared the Ph.D. entrance test and became a junior research fellow at NCRA. I readily chose pulsar search as my Ph D thesis topic because of my interest. After submitting my thesis, I moved to Radio Astronomy Centre in Ooty as a visiting scholar. Here, I worked on a different kind of radio telescope, the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). While working at Ooty, I got an offer to work with Dr Duncan Lorimer (the discoverer of Fast Radio Bursts or FRBs) at the West Virginia University in the USA. I immediately took it up and joined in April 2017. I am currently working there as a post-doctoral scholar.

What about the highs and lows of your career so far?

Getting the prestigious Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) fellowship in 2007 gave me direct access to research institutes and their libraries across India. It was also a confidence booster which showed me that I can actually make a career in research. Discovering my first pulsar in 2010, which was a first professional achievement for me, then getting my first paper published in an international journal in 2016, which gave me peer recognition and also a job offer from Dr Duncan Lorimer. It is always inspiring to work with pioneers of the field. He is both my personal as well as professional idol. Of course, defending my thesis and getting my Ph. D. was a major milestone.

There was a period of 4-5 months during the third year of my Ph. D. when I was struggling to detect the pulsar that I had discovered earlier. It was frustrating to travel to GMRT and to carry out observations only to not detect the pulsar again and again, but my patience paid off and I successfully completed the project. Another low was during the last year of my Ph. D. when I was applying for post-doctoral positions. I was writing my thesis and applying for jobs simultaneously and nothing was working out. This period taught me the value of trusting my ability because things worked out eventually. These highs and lows have shaped my career and personality in specific ways.

Please tell us about your upcoming/current project?

I am currently working on developing an instrument to search for FRBs at the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in USA. GBT is the largest, fully steerable radio telescope in the world and we are setting up the instrument that will search for these mysterious radio bursts from far away galaxies. Our instrument is unique because it will keep working round the clock, even when other observations are going on. We have almost completed the project and are eagerly awaiting first results.

What are your future plans?

I am looking for more research opportunities abroad to work on a variety of radio telescopes. This will provide me with work experience in diverse work environments and learn more about pulsar science. I would like to use this experience and contribute to the growing field of pulsar research in India. I am also planning to write popular literature, especially in Marathi to help develop scientific temper and to make people aware of the career opportunities in science."

It is learnt that the school management had subjected the students to corporal punishments on several other occasions in the past. The school correspondent and headmistress were arrested on Thursday under relevant sections of the Juvenile Justice Act and IPC.The incident happened at the Chaitanya Bharathi English Medium School in Nanasahebpet of Punganur mandal.

According to district education department and police officials, the school was re-opened on Wednesday after Christmas holidays. The five students of two classes, aged about 10 years, arrived just 10-15 days late to the school.

What did the flood give you? A new perspective; An open mind; It taught me what people are and how meaningless our fights in the name of religion are; A new hope; A broken home.

What did the flood take away from you? My dream; It took away my flower and vegetable garden. We lost all of our hens and also our loving dog.

Printed in both English and Malayalam, these are samplings of the questions and the responses to them that hang from clotheslines in Mexican artist Monica Mayer's installation at the ongoing fourth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Mayer is a feminist whose art, activism, blogs, newspaper column, books and performances, often in collaboration with other artists, are centred around the hazards, oppressions, tribulations and crises that women and the marginalised people in her country and elsewhere face daily.

After the catastrophic earthquake in Mexico in 2017, Mayer had posed similar questions to those who suffered, and that elicited replies very much like those voiced by the recent Kerala flood survivors. The direct reference to the deluge in Mayer's biennale project, The Clothesline, was echoed in the address of V Venu, former principal secretary of Kerala and CEO of ""Rebuild Kerala"" Committee, at the talk Art in Difficult Times, organised by BMW : ""It is a celebration of the resilience of the state and its people and also of art.""

This is also in keeping with the belief of Anita Dube, the biennale's first woman curator, that ""through the potential of social action, coming together, we ask and search for questions, critical questions, in the hope of dialogue.""

Mayer could not make it to Kochi for health reasons. In an interview over the phone and by email, she spoke about her art and her activism. Quite at variance with the image of the po-faced activist, Mayer can make light of the most serious issues, as demonstrated by her in Madres, a prime-time TV programme she produced in collaboration with colleague Maris Bustamante in the 1980s, in which a male celebrity TV anchor is made ""pregnant"". It was an effort to make public what is considered a private experience. ""In my work there is an overlapping of art, activism and pedagogy. The Clothesline, for example, has been used as all three,"" she reflects.

Mayer was born in 1954 in Mexico City. When she was training as an artist there, women artists were invisible. Even Frida Kahlo was known then only as the wife of muralist Diego Rivera. In art school, the ""progressive"" male peers told the women they were less creative because ""they lost their creativity with motherhood."" These ""unscientific and dumb"" comments pushed her to join Woman's Building, a feminist art school in Los Angeles.

In 1978, Mayer was invited to participate in an exhibition at Mexico City's Museum of Modern Art that featured performance and installation art. The theme was 'The City', and that's when she decided to do El Tendedero (The Clothesline). She asked women what they disliked about the city. ""I moved around in public transport all the time and sexual harassment is very bad. At the time not even the feminist groups were talking about this issue because there were very, very few of us and we were dealing with issues such as abortion, forced sterilisation and rape. The shape of the clothesline, apart from aesthetic issues, represented a traditionally female activity, but also reflected a basic activity in the feminist movement... allowing us to learn to speak up and also listen to each other,"" she says.

Mayer has worked individually, collectively and collaboratively. Her two longest collaborations were with Bustamante, with whom she founded the first feminist art group in Mexico, the Polvo de Gallina Negra, which means 'black hen powder' -- a means of protection against ""evil"" eye, according to local belief. ""We felt it was difficult to be an artist in Mexico, harder to be a woman artist but almost impossible to be a feminist artist, so we decided to give our group a name to protect us.""

In Pinto mi Raya, Mayer and Víctor Lerma, a Mexico City-based contemporary artist, put together a performance titled Abrazos (Hugs). ""We asked our friends in Mexico to share stories of the most important hugs for them and we take them to these other contexts. One of us 'narrates' the hug, and the other one gives it. It is a simple gesture of recognition and sharing as human beings,"" says Mayer. They have performed in other countries too, on invitation, but say it is ""strange"" for them to do the piece in another context and country on short notice, because they work specifically with the art community in Mexico.

When Mayer was invited to the Kochi Biennale, she was perplexed because she did not know either the context or the local language (Malayalam). ""But sharing experiences can build a bridge between our cultures even if we are at the other side of the world. I asked my friends through Facebook to share their experience about the earthquake... and I asked the team at Kochi to get in touch with flood victims,"" she says."

A video of the shocking incident shows six students aged 9-10 years, belonging to Class 3 and 4, standing naked in the hot sun, with their pants down to their ankles and their arms up in the air. The boys stand outside their classroom, even as other students pass by.

The private school, located in the interiors of Chittoor, is run and owned by the school principal Maharaja Naidu, who is on the run after the video came to the attention of child rights activists.

According to child rights activists, the students' parents allege that it was the principal who humiliated the students by asking them to remove their clothes for being late to school.

Some parents also say that the kids were punished for not completing their homework. The parents have been staging a protest in front of the school since Thursday morning, 27 December.

Speaking to TNM, Achyuta Rao, president of Hyderabad-based child rights organisation Balala Hakula Sangham, alleges that not just the principal, but the Mandal Educational Officer (MEO) is also colluding with the school authorities and is trying to hush up the issue.

""Our organisation had a word with the MEO. Instead of immediately cancelling the recognition of the school, the MEO Leela Rani is trying to cover up the issue and has said that she will be taking up the matter with the higher authorities. Is that how an issue of such serious nature has to be dealt with? The principal of the school should be booked under POCSO Act as it's a clear case of exploiting the children's modesty. The children should also be given psychological counselling in the aftermath of such a traumatic experience,"" Rao said.

Balala Hakula Sangham has filed a complaint with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) and has demanded that action be taken under the POCSO Act. Until now, the police have not registered a case against the school management.

Speaking to the local media, Chittoor DEO B Pratap Reddy, said an investigation into the issue is underway and that the school's recognition for the academic year 2019-2020 could be withdrawn.

From darkness to light. Or so I thought when I heard about my shifting from the dark dungeons of coal mines, as coal secretary, to the bright lights of school education, as secretary for school education and literacy.

However, I discovered soon that in the coal sector, mining was underground and mafias operated above it, but in the minefield of school education, it was the other way round. All the education mafias existed underground, and they were all masked, masquerading as so-called noble giants. Having taken on some of the mafias of the coal sector and partly succeeded in bringing the sector to order, the task was now to handle these 'noble giants'. It was made more difficult as there was no public outrage against invisible scams in education as was in the case of coal.

Everything seemed to be apparently in order.

To make matters worse, I was the fifth person to hold the charge of secretary in the education department in just two and a half years. Most of my predecessors with impeccable credentials in the education sector did not continue or were not allowed to continue. The government apparently found in me to be the most 'educated' person (I had never worked in this sector except for a brief tenure of three months in 1997 in adult education in Uttar Pradesh) to handle this sector.

It would be an understatement to state that the education sector was in bad shape - both in terms of budgetary allocation and human resource management.

Also read: My friend told me the coal sector was like 'Gangs of Wasseypur': Former secy Anil Swarup

The budgetary allocation for school education was Rs 55,115 crores during 2014-15. This amount got reduced in subsequent years. For instance, the allocation for 2016-17 was Rs 43,554 crore.

On the human resource front too, the situation was alarming. The department had five secretaries between 2014 and 2016. A number of joint secretaries were also changed during this period. It was like musical chairs reminiscent of my days in UP where it was rumoured that the only industry flourishing was the transfer industry.

In the two biggest states of the country, the positioning of top management followed a peculiar pattern. Whereas in UP, there were two additional chief secretary-level officers manning school education and secondary education separately (creating huge coordination problems), in the state of Bihar, one officer looked after both the education and health departments. Consequently, the health of education continues to suffer.

In addition to this, the mafias were having a field day, eating into the system, like termites. Fortunately, like all mafias, those in the education sector too were not a majority, but played a dominant role in decision-making. They were extremely well connected and deeply entrenched. There were a host of mafias, but the prominent ones were operating in these areas:

There are around 16,000 B.Ed and D.El.Ed colleges in the country. A large number of these exist only in name. If you pay them well, you can get a degree without an effort. It was rumoured that if you pay them more, they could even arrange for a 'naukri' (a government job). Action was initiated by then chairman of National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) Santosh Mathews, an upright officer, by issuing notices to all the colleges to furnish the details of their existence on affidavits. The idea was to ensure that only those that actually existed got recognition and in case of wrong information they could be prosecuted. It worked initially, but the colleges realised that quite a few of them could be in trouble. Despite the support he got from most of the states, he was put under enormous pressure by the mafias who took the 'judicial' route to pin down the chairman. He had to quit.

In a few northern states of the country, a number of examination centres are given on 'theka' (contract) for copying. These centres are highly 'priced' as they facilitate mass copying or cheating during examinations. The current chief minister of UP, Yogi Adityanath, came down heavily on this mafia. This was last done by Kalyan Singh in 1991, but thereafter no chief minister could dare to do that. Consequent to the steps taken in UP in this year's exams, more than one million students chose not to give exams. It is a reflection of the 'addiction' to mass copying.

Also read: To fix India's education system, we need good action plans not policies

The publishing industry thrives on the education sector. People with vested interests want to maintain status quo as this benefits them. It happens at two levels. As respective state governments provide free books to students, there are various ways in which money is made. The 'mandatory cuts' in getting the books printed centrally constitutes a substantial portion. The initiative taken by the UP government in 2018 and the consequent savings thereunder lends credence to this allegation. The Bihar government is toying with the idea of direct benefit transfers recognising the 'dealings' inherent in central printing and distribution.

The other level of money making is done by a handful of private publishers who enter into an 'arrangement' with the private schools in the name of quality, and compel the students to buy almost four to five times more expensive books as compared to the NCERT ones. If all the students of around 20,000 CBSE-affiliated schools were to source NCERT books, there would be an estimated annual expenditure of around Rs 650 crores. Compared to this, if they source books from private publishers, it would cost around Rs 3,000 crores per annum. The difference is too great to justify the quality argument.

The NCERT did a wonderful job in the current academic year to ensure that books were available on time so that the students were not compelled to buy expensive books, but this effort will need to continue. The NCERT will always be under pressure from people with vested interests to be 'inefficient'.

Most of the private schools in India contribute enormously to imparting quality education. However, some of them are bringing a bad name to this segment. There are some extremely powerful individuals who are able to get away with the most immoral things in education. They violate various norms, legal and ethical, with impunity because having been part of the official machinery at some point in time they know the tricks of the trade.

Irrational hiking of fee, charging huge sums of money to 'lend' their brand, harassing the brand assignees are some of the many tricks they practice. The chairperson of the CBSE Rajesh Chatur who chose to take them on was shown the door in 2017. His successor, Anita Karwal, one of the finest civil servants, was also set to be 'sacrificed'. But she held her ground despite pressure.

The good news in all of this is yet again from UP where the state has enacted a law on the fee regulation after consulting all the stakeholders. Hence, the legislation has been welcomed by all. Hopefully, other states will follow suit.

Authorities at Chaitanya Bharati School forced the students studying in class III and IV to stand naked outside the school after they came in late on Wednesday. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) filed a complaint against the school, following which the district administration lodged a police complaint.

Punganuru sub-inspector P Gouri Shankar said they have booked academic in-charge Dulam Bhuvaneswari and correspondent Kadiyala Nagaraju Naidu for forcing the students to stand outside the school in the sun. ""We received a complaint from Punganuru mandal educational officer (MEO) Pulluru Leelarani on Thursday,"" he said. The accused have been booked under several sections of the IPC, including for causing hurt, assault and criminal intimidation, and section 75 (cruelty) of Juvenile Justice Act.

There are allegations that though the issue was highlighted earlier, the MEO did not initiate any action against the authorities and acted only after Chittoor collector P S Pradyumna ordered an inquiry into it. Chittoor district educational officer, K Panduranga Swamy, has issued orders withdrawing the recognition of the school on Thursday.

'Children must be counselled'

The NCPCR alleged that MEO initially tried to suppress the matter and demanded that his immediate suspension for ""colluding with school management to hush up the issue.""

Child-rights activist Achyuta Rao, who brought the matter to NCPCR, demanded that children be counselled. He also accused police of lapses as they have not invoked Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act."

A High Court bench issued a show cause notice to the managing societies of three schools asking why it should not order appropriate action against them, following a petition challenging their change of name mid-year from Presidium to Prudence.

In mid-November, The Indian Express had reported that three schools under the prominent Presidium franchise informed parents that they had chosen to disassociate from it due to financial irregularities. They stated that they would be known as 'Prudence' schools under the chairmanship of G S Matharoo, who was part of the management team of Presidium group.

A bench of Justice C Hari Shankar heard a petition by a group of parents, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector-22 branch of Prudence. The plea alleged the name change was done without following due process and that it jeopardised the future of students by running the risk of de-recognition by CBSE.

The parents have petitioned against the management societies of all three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 16 and Dwarka Sector 22 -- stating that the name change had been affected in the middle of the academic year without prior notification or consultation with them.

In November, Education Minister Manish Sisodia had told The Indian Express that while a school cannot be compelled to remain part of a franchise, it requires government approval to do so and that no prior application had been received from the three schools.

The Prudence schools are now operating with a new logo, signboards, ID cards and uniforms. According to Matharoo, the change was instituted keeping the best interests of students in mind. He said the schools would file their response in court: ""Only the name has been changed, which was done through unanimous resolutions of all three managing societies due to financial malpractices by Presidium. Everything else remains the same... We submitted our proposal for name change to the Directorate of Education soon after the circular was sent to parents, and the proposal is currently being processed.""

The court re-notified the matter for February 2019, and gave the respondents four weeks to file a counter affidavit.

""We are examining the legal aspects of both the proposal and parents' complaints... and the validity and precedent for post-facto approval in such cases,"" said Director of Education Sanjay Goel."

Honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham Achyuta Rao had earlier brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi. He wanted the commission to issue an order to initiate action under the POCSO (Protection of Childre n from Sexual Offences) Act.

Chittoor district educational officer K. Panduranga Swamy told Deccan Chronicle: ""It came to our notice that on Tuesday the school teacher punished some of the students of classes III and IV by letting them stand outside in the sun with bare bodies because they were late and had not done their homework.

Minister for industries N. Amarnath Reddy has also instructed the district collector to withdraw recognition to the school.

Under the collector's direction, the DEO further released a statement, which reads: ""As a result of the negligent behaviour of the management, the boys left with bare bodies and this is a serious lapse on the part of the management which cannot be excused and thus attracted the provisions of Rules in GO Ms No. 1, dated 01.01.1994 and Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 1988.

Events over the past few years have prompted many to revisit the idea of individual freedom. Indeed, not just in India, but elsewhere too, the idea of individual freedom is under intense scrutiny. Are governments across the world increasingly posing a threat to liberty? By corollary, are fascist policies and rhetoric on the rise?

Persons with a liberal bent of mind, who prize individual freedoms like free speech, gender and racial equality, are especially troubled, for our country appears to be at a juncture where fundamental notions of modern India are under existential threat.

One particular freedom that has come under fire is the freedom of practising one's own religion. Personal freedom is very often associated with secularism, which, as received from the Western canon, is the separation of church from state. Sometimes secularism is also seen as a negation of religion completely. Indeed, many religious leaders taught that secular people do not believe in gods. But in my view, even if you are a temple-going Hindu or a devout Muslim, you can still be secular.

Unfortunately, those of us who value religious freedom have been disillusioned by multiple governments once too often. The current BJP-led government has no pretensions about its dislike for the secular idea. Even those governments that proudly flaunt the label of ""secularism"" have subjected us to their non-secular realpolitik. Take the politics of Rajiv Gandhi, for instance, often touted as a ""secular"" Prime Minister: his government not only overturned the Shah Bano judgment, but also banned Salman Rushdie's The Satanic Verses and had the locks of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya opened to Hindus. Every political party, including the Congress and the BJP, has played communal politics with everyone in India -- Hindu, Muslim, minorities -- in the search for pliable vote banks.

In contrast, an exhibition of true ""secularism"" would be open-ended, either agnostic or, at the other extreme, in a country like India where faith is so central, multi-religious. Most importantly, at its heart, true secularism would be driven by universal values of truth, compassion and equality, which are fundamental values that straddle all religions.

In 21 Lessons for the 21st Century, Yuval Noah Harari captures the essence of these values beautifully. Truth, not to be confused with belief, has no sole custodian. Truth is based on observation, evidence, and inference, and is accessible to all. Compassion comes from an understanding of suffering: a compassionate person does not kill not because their faith tells them not to, but because they know that killing causes immense suffering. And the universal value of equality comes from a recognition of both truth and compassion, empowering people to never substitute ""uniqueness"" with ""superiority"". Everyone may be unique in their own way, but they are all still equally unique -- no one being more specially so than the other. Ultimately, we cannot find truth, or learn compassion, or appreciate equality if we have no freedom to think, to question, to seek, to find these for ourselves. These freedoms are, ultimately, the most valuable. Recognising these freedoms was central to the politics of Mahatma Gandhi. Sadly, our leaders since have either forgotten or chosen to turn a blind eye to these ideas completely.

What can we do to change this? We need not look to foreign shores or to long-forgotten pasts. We only need to open India's nearly 70-year-old liberal manifesto. The Constitution contains all the declarations essential to a nation that preserves individual liberties. It is for us to protect it from neglect and disrepair.

It was B.R. Ambedkar, the key driver of the Constituent Assembly, who said: ""The assertion by the individual of his own opinions and beliefs, his own independence and interest as over and against group standards... is the beginning of all reform."" These ideas also find their way into the Constitution.

Even as the Constitution was being written, even as the leaders of the independence movement were negotiating for our freedom, Hindutva forces present at the time -- the days of the advent of the Hindu Mahasabha, of Veer Savarkar and B.S. Moonje -- were suspicious of secular ideas. They were, instead, great admirers of Hitler and Mussolini, with Moonje even going to Italy to meet the latter, and Savarkar justifying Hitler's treatment of Jews.

This suspicion continues amongst the legatees of the Hindu Mahasabha, in their mistrust of the Indian Constitution, for it is this document borrowed from Western ideals, they believe, that obstructs the idea of the Hindu Rashtra. In today's India, as a result, the most liberal document that we have, the Constitution, is at risk.

In his new book, How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them, Yale University philosophy professor Jason Stanley identifies 10 characteristics that define fascist political movements. For example: ""Fascism always promises to return us to a mythic past."" Similarly, fascist politicians use propaganda, for example, about anti-corruption campaigns, even when they are transparently corrupt. Another aspect is anti-intellectualism, for the ""enemy of fascism is equality,"" and the target of such anti-intellectual campaigns are places of learning, like universities. How can the educated elite know anything about anything, the fascist believes. Only the mythical ""common man"" can know what is right; note the emphasis on ""man"", which includes no women, or racial and sexual minorities. The similarities do not end there. Unlike liberal democracies, based on freedom and equality, fascist regimes posit the dominant group's interests as the ultimate, unquestionable truth. The dominant group is also always the victim of the situation. They rely on conspiracy theories to justify calls to power. And most tellingly, fascist politicians promise a law and order regime designed not to seek out offenders, but to criminalise outliers, who are usually ethnic, religious or sexual minorities. Professor Stanley has the U.S. in mind, but surely there is some resonance closer home.

Today, we live in an India where we are told what we can and cannot eat, what we can and cannot watch, what we can and cannot speak about, and who we can or cannot marry. Dissent, particularly in universities and public spaces, is being curbed. Sloganeering and flag raising have become tests for nationalism. Journalists are shot dead at point blank range for the views they hold and propagate. Not long ago, the police arrested five political activists essentially for thought crimes and taking up the cause of the tribals. More recently, when actor Naseeruddin Shah expressed legitimate concerns about growing vigilantism, his views were blown out of proportion, and misunderstood as an expression of disloyalty to the country. Even public institutions like the central bank have not been spared. A school of thought appears to have gained prominence in India which believes that everything can be solved by violence, and that it is always better to have power concentrated in a few men.

As a judge, naturally, I wonder if the courts will save the Constitution. I am honestly sceptical about this. Although the Supreme Court has delivered some wonderful judgments recently, can the court fully play out its role as the ultimate defender of the Constitution? The past record of the judiciary in testing times is not very encouraging, if we think of the Emergency. New allegations that the former Chief Justice of India (CJI) was perhaps being ""remote controlled"" do not invite much confidence either.

A few other things trouble me too: our present CJI, before taking office, publicly lectured about independent judges and noisy journalists. Just recently, the judicial system allowed a journalist in Odisha to remain in jail for over a month for making certain remarks about the Sun Temple in Konark. Our Supreme Court even refused to grant him bail, reportedly remarking that if one's life were in danger, what better place was there than to stay in jail. When the court is angered about the publication of information pertaining to the working of critical public institutions like the Central Bureau of Investigation on grounds of confidentiality, one cannot help but worry.

All this has made me less optimistic about the judiciary doing its bit. Ultimately, it is the people who will protect the Constitution, and all of the wisdom it contains about personal liberties and individual freedoms. Prof Stanley phrases this appropriately when he says, ""The ordinary citizen [must] stand up and loudly confront people who engage in... fascist rhetoric and not be afraid. Those millions of acts of individual bravery, if we can stitch together, will save us."" This is a time for individual acts of bravery. These are what will save us from a dangerous future."

The government always discriminates when it comes to providing grants to these academic institutions,"" said Mohandas Pai, Chairman, Manipal Global Education.

Furqan Qamar, Secretary General, Association of Indian Universities said that private universities have not been able to create much impact on the research front. These universities should mobilise resources and invest in research, he added.

He also said that there has been an increase in the number of private universities, which indicates potential for having more privately-run institutions of higher learning.

According to the All India Survey of Higher Education, the number of private universities in 2007-08 was 16, but the number has gone up to 262, a decade later.

With industry 4.0 ushering in new technologies, private universities are already focussing on these emerging technologies.

""The advantage that we have over government universities is that we can quickly update the curricula on offer as we do not have any bureaucratic structure to lord over us,"" said Sanjeev Bansal, Director, Amity Business School.

More than 100 newcomers made their debut as directors. Four women directors released their dream projects, all mainstream movies, which met with varying responses at the box office. While superstars continue to be in their own orbit, young actors came in droves and became scene-stealers. If indies showed that stars and big budgets were not a necessity to make good cinema, actors like Fahadh Faasil, Tovino Thomas, Shane Nigam, Soubin Shahir and Antony Varghese, Manju Warrier, Parvathy, Nimisha Sajayan, Aishwarya Lekshmi, Samyuktha Menon and many more breathed life into a wide range of heroes and heroines. Several character actors became the toast of Mollywood.

It was also the year when Malayalam cinema bagged several national and international awards. True, the flood, expensive projects that nosedived at the box office and piracy had vexed filmmakers. But the industry bounced back and the year-end marked a happy 2018 with almost all the releases doing well.

Away from the bright lights, many aspects reeked of the malaise in the industry's patriarchal and misogynistic set-up. Trolls, cyber attacks, denial of work and character assassination failed to silence members of the Women in Cinema Collective that continues to question chauvinistic attitudes in the industry and male-dominated trade associations.

As Mollywood stands on the threshold of a new year, here is to new beginnings and a more equitable playing ground.

Some of them wowed viewers; some turned out to be damp squibs and some should go back to film school to begin anew. Whatever their fortunes at the box office, many of the films ushered in a new wave of narratives and themes.

Multiple award-winner B Ajith Kumar made a mark with his hard-hitting Eeda, which looked at political violence in Kannur sans any rosy spectacles. Dijo Jose Antony managed a sleeper hit with Queen, albeit it was panned by critics. Prajesh Sen's kick-off with Captain, a biopic on footballer VP Sathyan, with Jayasurya getting into the shoes of the character, scored at the box office too. Tinu Pappachan and Shaji Padoor made a mark with Swanthanthryam Ardharathriyil and Mammootty-starrer Abrahaminte Santhathikal respectively. Ramesh Pisharody tested new waters with Panchavarnathatha. Gireesh Damodar's Uncle and Vishnu Narayan's Maradona did not send fans into a frenzy but scored with them nevertheless.

Nine new directors made their bow at the International Film Festival of Kerala. Vipin Radhakrishnan, Vinu AK, Unnikrishnan Avala, Sumesh Lal, Binu Bhaskar, Goutham Soorya, Sudeep Elamon and PK Biju Kuttan were among the filmmakers who showcased their maiden Malayalam feature films at the IFFK.

It has been a year when Malayalam cinema won international and national recognition. Beginning with Jayaraj's Bhayanakam, which won three national awards and two State film awards, the year saw Lijo Jose Pellissery's Ea.Ma.Yau. winning a rich haul of awards.

The find of the year was undoubtedly Zakariya Mohammed, the director of Sudani from Nigeria. In the meantime, D Bijukumar's Painting Life became a globetrotter by winning a place in several prestigious film festivals. Sanal Kumar Sasidharan's much-lauded S Durga finally was officially released in India after a lot of controversy on account of its title.

The year that went by was also the period when many women in cinema all over the world found their voice. As #MeToo sparked off a fire that refused to be put down, it consumed many big names in cinema. It spread to Bollywood and Tollywood too. Mollywood simmered but #MeToo has not yet spread in Malayalam cinema. The Women in Cinema Collective spoke up for women in cinema although they had to tackle trolls and face a backlash from the film industry itself.

However, while most of Bollywood turned their back on the tainted actors, directors et al., mainstream Mollywood seemed to have no qualms in welcoming even those accused of heinous acts against women.

Seasoned filmmakers proved their expertise in the medium. Veteran cinematographer Venu's Carbon had an intriguing storyline and Fahadh Faasil. It impressed even when the film did not glitter all that much at the box office. Shyamaprasad showed why he is the best in the genre of relationship dramas with his heart-warming tale of a young man with Asperger Syndrome in Hey Jude. M Mohanan's Aravindante Adhithikal pulled in family audiences. Amal Neerad's Varathan, his best till now, was perhaps the first Malayalam film that took a hard look at the many forms of sexual harassment that a woman faces in contemporary Kerala.

While Abrid Shine got mixed reviews for his Poomaram, a take on college youth festivals that was released after several delays, Kamal's Aami, a biopic on Madhavikutty, did not quite turn out to be a bestseller.

Pranav Mohanlal, Kalidas Jayaram and Shravan Mukesh, all with famous surnames, followed in daddy's footsteps. Of the three, it was Pranav who tasted box office success with his Aadhi."

The UN recognised the Prime Minister in the Policy Leadership category for his bold environmental leadership on the global stage. His pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance where the country heralded a global coalition of nations to tackle climate change by leveraging the power of solar energy which has been lauded globally. Some of the major highlights of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the year 2018 are outlined below:-

World Environment Day:

Considering India's global leadership in environmental protection and climate change sectors, the UNEP had chosen India to be the global host for World Environment Day (WED) on 5 June, 2018.

The main event was organized in Delhi and included a series of conferences in Vigyan Bhawan, a mega exhibition in Rajpath Lawns behind Vigyan Bhawan and the concluding event was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister and dignitaries from UN also attended the event. This WED, 2018 focused on ""Plastic Pollution"" which is one of the most challenging environmental concerns today.

Green Good Deeds Campaign:

Green Good Deeds, the societal movement launched by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan to protect environment and promote good living in the country, has earned worldwide accolades.

""Green Good Deeds"" is an idea to take environmental awareness to the people and get them involved. Formally launched in January 2018, the campaign lauds small positive actions performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of environmental protection. The Ministry has drawn up a list of over 600 Green Good Deeds and asked people to alter their behaviour to Green Good Behaviour to fulfill their Green Social Responsibility. These small, positive actions, to be performed by individuals or organisation to strengthen the cause of environmental protection have been enlisted on a mobile App called Dr Harsh Vardhan App.

Students under Eco-clubs are implementing the Green Good Deeds (GGDs) initiative which seeks to transform the people's behaviour into Green Good Behaviour and fulfil Green Social Responsibility. A ten point agenda has been developed to implement the GGDs through Nodal agencies in State/UTs implementing the Ecoclub programme. Various activities covered under GGDs like cleanliness drives within the school campus, carry out waste segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable, paper re-cycling and conducting tree plantation drives etc are being implemented across the country by the students. The green attitude is visible in their actions. Further GREEN GOOD DEEDS event was successfully organised on 6.10.2018 at India International Science Festival (IISF) 2018 held at Indira Gandhi Prathishthan, Lucknow. Event was inaugurated by Dr. A.K. Mehta Additional Secretary, MoEFCC. Exhibition showcasing the success stories under Ecoclub programme. Around 200 Ecoclub students from Uttar Pradesh participated in the Drawing and Essay competitions.

In order to skill youth in environment, forest and wildlife sectors and enable them to be gainfully employed/ self-employed, MoEF&CC launched a Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) in June, 2017 on a pilot basis. The programme is now being scaled to an all India level. More than 30 skilling programmes are being conducted during 2018-19, covering diverse fields-pollution monitoring (air/ water/ soil), STP/ETP/CETP operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting & auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, para taxonomy, including PBRs, mangroves conservation, bamboo management and livelihood generation.

During 2018-19 from August till date, 944 candidates have successfully completed the different skilling courses. Currently, 568 candidates are enrolled in various ongoing courses. The objective of creating a pool of Master Trainers during 2018-19 is also being met as 283 of the successful trainees have offered to be Master Trainers, who would skill more youth across the country in various skill sets, related to environment, forest and wildlife. A mobile app giving information about the training programme being conducted under GSDP, list of the Institutes offering these programme and other details has been also launched.

Reclassification of Bamboo & Removal from Category of Tree:

The Government of India has made concerted efforts to promote bamboo cultivation right from enabling regulatory provision, to supporting the bamboo plantation on a large scale by launching newly restructured National Bamboo Mission with a budget outlay of Rs 1290 crore.

The amendment in Indian Forest Act, 1927, will facilitate the inter-state movement of bamboo, as there will be no requirement of permit during transit from one State to another. It will ultimately result in reducing the gap of availability of resources from bamboo-surplus states to bamboo-deficit states. As a result, both producers and consumers will be benefitted.

The Climate Change Division of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) looks after the issues related to climate change including the international negotiations and domestic policies and actions. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol. The Division is also responsible for submission of National Communications (NATCOMs) and the Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to UNFCCC. Several domestic programmes/ schemes have been initiated in the recent years for addressing climate change. Some key initiatives include the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) among others. In order to create and strengthen the scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change in the country, different studies have also been initiated under CCAP.

During the year 2018, many important bilateral and multilateral meetings and negotiations on climate change were held in the run up to the 24 Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC (COP-24), in which Hon'ble Minister, EF&CC and senior officials of the Ministry participated. The Ministry hosted international meetings of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) on 1 and 2 November 2018 and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries on 19 -20 November 2018. The meeting has helped in strengthening and securing common interest and positions of the developing countries in the run up to COP-24 to the UNFCCC.

Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP-24) in Katowice, Poland was successful in adopting Paris Agreement Work Programme. The conference was significant one which focused on other key issues including the conclusion of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and the stocktake of Pre-2020 actions implementation and ambition. India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). India re-affirmed its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation and its image has undergone a positive change

An India Pavilion was also setup during Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP 24) of UNFCCC held in Katowice, Poland from December 3 to 14, 2018. The theme of pavilion this year was 'One World One Sun One Grid' based on an ambitious target set by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the first assembly of the International Solar Alliance on October 2018 that 40 percent of its installed power capacity will be from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Eminent dignitaries from the other participating countries of Japan, Qatar, Austria, Maldives, UK and the host country Poland visited the India Pavilion and gave remarkable feedback. The India Pavilion also became a platform to bring together 43 different stakeholder institutions including Central Ministries, State Governments/ Departments, Think Tanks, Civil Society Organisations, etc. to showcase their climate change action taken in various sectors through 20 side events. A footfall of about 14-15,000 people at India pavilion during the course of COP-24.

In 2018, under National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), a total amount of Rs. 42.16 crore has been released to seven (07) ongoing projects to support adaptation activities in Rajasthan, Sikkim, H.P., Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Manipur and Kerala.

After the gang was busted in December last year, the police said it had cheating more than 20,000 students across India and jeopardised the careers of many unsuspecting candidates who bagged government jobs using fake certificates issued by them.

On Wednesday, Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at least one such candidate -- who had bagged a UP Police job using a fake degree -- had been dismissed from his job after his documents were found to be fake.

The first person to be arrested was 23-year-old Altaf Raza, who was one of the six persons nabbed last year as well. The police said he was ""one of the masterminds"" of the racket. ""We arrested him on a day he was to appear at a court hearing in the previous case,"" said DCP Deo.

Raza had allegedly learnt the trade from one Shiv Prasad Pandey a few years ago. Pandey was arrested with Raza last year. After coming out on bail, he has gone underground, said the DCP.

The other two men arrested in the latest case are Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar, who run a school in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria and were allegedly involved in scouting for potential candidates as well as schools in desperate need for recognition certificates.

""The gang promised to provide marksheets and degrees of Class 10 and 12 in two-three months without any tests or requirements. The documents provided were fake,"" said DCP Deo.

Each time their website was busted, the gang would allegedly come up with a new portal with a different name.

The police claimed to have recovered a large number of fake marksheets, provisional certificates and migration certificates. ""In their last few months of operation, the gang had cheated more than 10,000 students from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar,"" said the DCP.

Wuhan Summit between Xi and Modi was a politically expedient move, driven by national interests.

Chinese President Xi Jinping's 'informal' summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Wuhan this year, ostensibly to build strategic communications and provide an improved long-term perspective for what had become an increasingly adversarial India-China relationship, underscored by the 73-day standoff at Doklam in 2017, fits a larger Chinese foreign policy strategy. During the past several months, China has focused on improving relations with several neighbours, including India, at a time when China's relationship with the US has soured and the future appears uncertain.

The Wuhan Summit represented for China a classic case of the hedging strategy described in Walter Andersen's article: How India, China and US manage their ties will shape future of east Asia. For India, calming the bilateral relationship signalled the importance of China in Prime Minister Modi's goals to develop India economically and at least partially remove an issue that could be used against the BJP in the upcoming 2019 general elections. It also sent a message that India, while developing closer relations with the US, is not involved in a US effort to contain China.

While there is no evidence that either side made any serious concessions at Wuhan, some broad areas of cooperation did emerge from the summit. Xi Jinping and Narendra Modi agreed there should be better communication and coordination to manage differences along the disputed boundary, as well as enhanced cooperation on fighting terrorism, which is a common threat to both countries.

During a subsequent meeting on the sidelines of the recent G20 Summit in Argentina，the two leaders said there had been a ""perceptible improvement"" in bilateral ties since the Wuhan ""informal"" Summit. They asserted that the Wuhan meet was a milestone in China-India ties and called it the ""Wuhan Spirit""，indicating a desire on both sides to further build upon it. The public discourse of each about the other has improved considerably since the verbal fist-shaking during the Doklam standoff.

Rather than reverse or reset each side's foreign policy，however，this apparent improvement of the relationship between China and India was primarily the product of a more fluid geopolitical landscape and it remains unlikely that this meeting will substantially alter the relationship's trajectory in basic policy terms.

The Wuhan Summit between Xi and Modi was a politically expedient move, which was driven by national interests - the fear of external powers for China and domestic economic and political considerations for India. While the two sides have a wide range of common interests, the fundamental strategic differences between India and China are still as wide as they were before Wuhan.

Conflicting border claims will not be resolved any time soon; India will continue to oppose China's One Belt One Road project, especially the segment that goes through that part of Kashmir occupied by Pakistan. China will continue to oppose India's developing strategic ties to the US and to Japan. India still faces the reality of the rise of China as an economic and military power in its neighbourhood and to the south in the Indian Ocean. Moreover, it is not at all clear if China accepts the rise of India as a power in these areas. Thus, hedging is a rational choice for both India and China in this asymmetric US-India-China system.

Also read: How India, China and US manage their ties will shape future of east Asia

Hedging combines the elements of cooperation，competition and rivalry in order to manage uncertainty and avoid risks. In the triangular hedging system of China-India-US，each party is an autonomous player. Each would react negatively to threats of core interests by one of the members by moving closer to the other（and sometimes to a power outside the triangle）to convince the offending side to back off from its threatening acts. Each side thus gives the other two a stake in the peace and stability in the region. Through the tactic of hedging, these three players can maintain a delicate balance between friend and foe - and the Wuhan Summit is a good example of this balancing.

What seems to inform Wuhan and the subsequent spirit of friendship is the increasingly tense US-China relationship since Donald Trump took office in January 2017. The US views China as an unequivocal economic and military challenge to American primacy and engaged in unfair trading policies. China, for its part, is concerned that the US is engaged in efforts to contain it. Prominent on this score is the apprehension that America's quadrilateral 'Indo-Pacific' strategy (involving India, Japan, Australia), known as the Quad, has a strategic anti-China objective. The recent Chinese tactic of seeking to improve relations with India, as well as with Japan and Australia is a result of this.

China's approach to India represents an effort to build on a wide range of common interests, such as climate change, anti-terrorism，cooperating with each other to develop their respective economies，and support for a multi-polar world. Given this context, China wants to move closer to India to meet the challenges from the US, and more specifically, to reduce the chances of India itself moving even closer to the US strategically. While there are significant differences between India and China, which are unlikely to be resolved any time soon, they are both rising powers with a powerful military that includes nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them at long distances. Any military conflict between them would be catastrophic and threaten their mutual interest in generating domestic economic prosperity，as well as peace in their own region. Their respective governments depend on economic growth to maintain political legitimacy.

Also read: The many ways India must NOT think about China

For India, although the US is the country's most important global partner，and the Trump administration also seeks to lift India's priority in the region，important disagreements remain on many issues，such as relations with Iran，Afghanistan，and global governance to name three.

New Delhi may consider possibilities of working through Beijing on these issues and hedge against its relationship with the US given the unpredictability of the Trump administration. Perhaps this is why New Delhi is keeping a low profile in the 'Quad' - the emerging security group. New Delhi walks a fine line to avoid being caught in the middle of the growing rivalry between China and the US without simultaneously weakening ties with the US.

The reason for Indian caution is its recognition of the need for a functional relationship with China, as demonstrated by the Wuhan Summit. Furthermore，because Modi may face a tough re-election campaign in 2019，keeping Doklam under wraps until at least after that election will be a political imperative. This likely puts an even greater priority on India to maintain a stable India-China relationship.

As India's former foreign secretary Shyam Saran said，over the past several years，balance has been maintained between the competitive and cooperative components through bilateral summits and multilateral meetings between the two countries. This balance had been eroding as the power gap between them widened. The Wuhan Summit has restored the balance to some extent，but this can only be sustained if India narrows the power gap through more rapid buildup of its economic and military capabilities. In our opinion，this balance can only be sustained if India and China manage the uncertainties and lower the risks in their own relationship. While Wuhan may not have altered the basic strategic trajectory of each country, it signalled that both calculate the need for stable bilateral relations to achieve larger geostrategic goals.

One of the arrested men, Shambhu Nath (46), ran a school in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh flaunting this fake board's recognition. He registered 101 students in Class X and 49 in Class XII in the academic year 2016-17 and 27 students in Class X and 24 in Class XII in 2017-18. He claimed that he conducted the board examinations at his school in the middle of the year after being directed by BHSE and uploaded data on their website.

The story of Manoj Kumar, another school owner, is similar and he had taken the board's affiliation from its Lucknow office when it was being run by the present chairman Altaf Raja's former employer, Shiv Shankar Pandey.

Manoj graduated from Deoria and he and his uncle Sharvan opened Mahatma Budh Ambedkar Senior Secondary School at his native place with affiliation from BHSE. He got 882 students in Class X and 242 in Class XII in the academic year 2016-17 and 26 students in Class X and 6 in Class XII in 2018.

Apart from giving affiliation to schools, the syndicate also sent flash messages to students who had failed matriculations or higher secondary papers offering them certificates. As a formality, they would send a question paper and the answersheet which the student would have to fill and send back to the board along with money after which the certificates would be mailed to their houses.

The certificates sent by BHSE bore a seal and Raja's signature along with a link to verify its authenticity. To verify the credentials of the certificate holder, an employer would have to click on the link or send a letter on the Vikaspuri address. An ""authenticity certificate"" would subsequently be issued.

The syndicate has a wide network of agents to lure students who couldn't pass classes X and XII. They would also keep a watch on students weak in studies.

On September 18, an information was received that one Altaf Raja along with his accomplices is operating a fake education board by the name of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi, from his office at Vikas Puri. They claim that their board is recognised and provide the mark sheet and certificates of 10th and 12th only in 2-3 months for Rs 5,000 to 10,000. Altaf Raja used to collect the details of students over Whatsapp and receive the money for providing fake documents through his bank account. A complaint regarding the running of fake education board was also received from the Directorate of Education, Delhi, Rajiv Ranjan, Additional Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said in a statement.

A team led by ACP Jasbir Singh was constituted to unravel the case. The team laid a trap and Altaf Raja was apprehended while delivering the fake certificates and mark sheets of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi, to a decoy customer sent by the Crime Branch team.

During interrogation, Altaf Raja disclosed that in 2014 he left studies and started working in the office of one Dr Shiv Prasad Pandey in Lucknow. He came to know that Dr Shiv Prasad Pandey posed himself as the Chairman of the Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi, and runs the branch office of the education board BHSE in Lucknow. He used to issue Certificates of class 10th and 12th by BHSE, Delhi for Rs 2,000 to 5,000 to the students.

He would issue online Recognition Certificate on the site of the board and the schools would conduct admission on the basis of the certificate.

Before recruitment to the police put baton in his hands in 2014, it was pencil that the 42-year-old from Nellikkuzhi in Kothamangalam wielded; and with quite some relish.

His passion for caricatures dates back to school days when he drew caricatures of friends and even teachers for fun. That love affair got a lot more intense when he progressed to college.

""Political cartoons were my favourites and I obsessively followed cartoons in newspapers by noted cartoonists such as Kesav, Yesudas, Gafoor and Gopikrishnan,"" recollected Mr. Faisal.

He never learned the art professionally though continued drawing caricatures during his graduation days at MA College in Kothamangalam.

However, it was while doing LLB at Government Law College, Ernakulam, that he won recognition for his skill, as he landed second prize in the Mahatma Gandhi University arts fest.

And his caricatures were featured in the college magazine as well.

For someone who started with caricatures of late Congress leader K. Karunakaran and finds former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as one of the easiest subjects, the uniformed job has forced self-imposed shackles on his creativity, especially with political cartoons for obvious reasons.

Nowadays, Mr. Faisal puts his skill to use in job-related assignments, especially at awareness classes being held for students.

""Caricatures can bring about much needed relief to students from the monotony of lectures. Apart from drawing their attention, caricatures will also help drive home the message much more effectively. For instance, while explaining the legality of public drinking, a caricature on the topic can convey it with a lot more impact than unending lectures,"" said Mr. Faisal.

He has been doing that in Kannur, Thalassery and Panoor where his job had taken him over the years thus keeping his passion alive."

The application brought by the hospital relied on the parens patriae jurisdiction in case of refusal of consent to a blood transfusion by D1.

Mercy Hospitals Victoria brought an urgent application to seek a declaration to administer blood products to a pregnant 17-year-old young woman of the Jehovah's Witness faith in the event that blood products were needed during the lead up to birth, during labour or after her child was born. The hospital relied on the Supreme Court's parens patriae jurisdiction. The court looked at Dept of Health and Community Services (NT) v JWB and SMB (Marion's case) (Marion's case), in which the High Court described the common law in Australia with respect to the legal capacity of minors to give or refuse consent to medical treatment.[3] In the present case, the court considered the balance between Gillick competence and the parens patriae jurisdiction in the context of the overriding duty to do what is in the best interests of the child.

At the time of the application, the first defendant (D1) was a 17-year-old woman who was 38 weeks pregnant. D1 consented to induction of labour to take place at the hospital operated by the plaintiff. She also consented that, if necessary, a caesarean section be performed to deliver her baby. D1 was of very small stature, it was her first baby and the baby was quite large, so the risk of requiring a caesarean section delivery and of associated post-partum haemorrhage was a significant one.

D1 is an adherent of the Jehovah's Witness faith. The hospital sought her consent to the administration of blood or blood products during or after delivery, if necessary to prevent serious injury or save her life. D1 refused such consent, because such administration is contrary to her faith as a Jehovah's Witness. D1 was a minor under law and so consent was sought from D1's mother, the second defendant (""D2""), who is also an adherent of the Jehovah's Witness faith. D2 informed the hospital that, if asked, she would not provide consent to the administration of blood or blood products to D1.

The hospital brought an urgent application to the court for a declaration:

that the [hospital] is authorised to administer to [D1] blood and/or blood products as considered reasonably necessary by her treating medical practitioners to save her life or to prevent serious injury during the course of induction of labour, labour, caesarean section and related procedures and the postnatal period in regard to her pregnancy.

Five issues required determination by the court:

The court briefly answered the first three of these questions. Firstly, a pseudonym order was made to protect the identities of the defendants together with a suppression order.Secondly, the requirement of a litigation guardian was dispensed with as D1 had representation comprised of counsel and instructing solicitor. And thirdly, the court found that it was not necessary for the unborn baby to be separately represented at the hearing.

Therefore the court focused on the remaining two questions: namely, whether the court's parens patriae jurisdiction is affected by certain statutes that provide for the making of medical treatment decisions and whether the court should make the declaration sought.

The parens patriae jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria is preserved by way of s 85(3) of the Constitution Act 1975 (Vic). The High Court in Marion's case illustrated that the parens patriae jurisdiction is an inherit jurisdiction to do what is for the benefit of the child. The court's care is a direct responsibility for those who cannot look after themselves.

An issue in this case concerned the capacity of D1 to refuse medical treatment, that is, whether she was Gillick competent. The court noted the proposition for Gillick competence, as summarised by the High Court, as follows:

... parental power to consent to medical treatment on behalf of a child diminishes gradually as the child's capacity and maturity grow and that this rate of development depends on the individual child ... A minor is, according to this principle, capable of giving informed consent when he or she ""achieves a sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed.

Macaulay J considered several Australian cases where, in the exercise of the parens patriae jurisdiction, the courts have been asked to authorise the administration of blood or blood products to a minor, who along with their parent, and for reasons associated with the beliefs of Jehovah's Witnesses, have refused to give such con- sent.

In Minister for Health v AS it was Pullin J's view that the paramountcy of the welfare of the child meant that protection of the child was to be elevated above all other interests, although those other interests were not to be disregarded and as such, the court ordered the child receive treatment.

In X v Sydney Children's Hospitals Network, Basten JA noted that religious beliefs, particularly minority religious beliefs, are not to be disregarded because they may be deemed irrational by broader community standards; his Honour observed that religious beliefs are internationally accepted as an aspect of an individual's fundamental autonomy which the state cannot interfere with and must not disregard. The Court said that:

To accord a religious belief weight is not to treat it as determinative. There may be cases in which the strength with which a belief is held, and the distress which would be caused by treatment which overrode that belief, might diminish the effectiveness of the treatment[.

Macaulay J then considered a Canadian decision of Malette v Shulman (Ontario Court of Appeal), conceding that the following statement was not made in the context of the exercise of the parens patriae jurisdiction but, in the light of autonomy of choice for the ""mature minor"", Macaulay J deemed it helpful:

The state's interest in preserving the life or health of a competent patient must generally give way to the patient's stronger interest in directing the course of her own life... Recognition of the right to reject medical treatment cannot, in my opinion, be said to depreciate the interest of the state in life or in the sanctity of life. Individual free choice and self-determination are themselves fundamental constituents of life. To deny individuals freedom of choice with respect to their healthcare can only lessen, and not enhance, the value of life.

Ultimately, Basten JA provided helpful guidance when considering a choice made by a child, even a child thought to be Gillick competent:

The interest of the state in preserving life is at its highest with respect to children and young persons who are inherently vulnerable, in varying degrees... Vulnerability lies at the heart of the disability identified by legal incapacity.

The following statutory provisions were considered by the court in their impact on the exercise of the court's parens patriae jurisdiction.

Section 24 of the HTA makes provision for administration of blood transfusions to children without consent. In defined circumstances, it relieves medical practitioners from criminal liability for administering a blood transfusion to a child where the consent of a parent of the child or some other person having authority to consent has been refused or not obtained. It applies where, in the opinion of a registered medical practitioner, the blood transfusion is a reasonable and proper treatment and without it the child is likely to die. A second concurring medical opinion must also be obtained or, in the case of an emergency or the unavailability of a second opinion, specified senior hospital officers may give consent. Section 24(2) provides that a blood transfusion administered to a child in accordance with the section, the transfusion is for all purposes ""deemed to have been administered or taken with the consent of a parent of the child or of a person having authority to consent to the administration of the transfusion.""

The court was informed by the hospital that it considered that it could administer a blood transfusion to D1 in the circumstances contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures outlined in s 24 and rely upon it for its own protection. However, the court was not convinced that it should equate the welfare of the child, as understood in the parens patriae jurisdiction, with the interests of the child as protected by the HTA. The relevant provisions of the HTA are only engaged if and when the child is ""likely to die"", and authorises lifesaving blood transfusions on medical considerations alone.

The parens patriae jurisdiction exists so that, in appropriate circumstances, even the parents' wishes (deemed or otherwise) can be overridden. Despite the existence of s 24 of the HTA, the parens patriae jurisdiction serves a vital purpose beyond the narrower concern of that Act. The scope of the protective jurisdiction is larger, to take into account all of the welfare interests of the child -- medical, spiritual, personal autonomy and identity. The two do not cover identical territory.

The MTPDA came into force on 12 March 2018. Relevantly, one of its main purposes was to provide for a person to execute an advance care directive (ACD) that gives binding instructions or expresses the person's preferences and values in relation to the person's future medical treatment.

Section 17 of the MTPDA requires that any witness to an ACD must certify that the person giving it appeared to have ""decision-making capacity"" in relation to each statement and, in particular, appeared to under- stand the nature and effect of each statement in the directive.

Decision-making capacity is defined in s 4 to require that the person be able to:

However, even if a child gave an instructional ACD to refuse consent for a blood transfusion, s 24 of the HTA would still permit a hospital to administer blood in an emergency in order to save the child's life without rendering the hospital criminally liable. Indeed, providing s 24 was complied with, the procedure would be deemed to have taken place with the parents' consent.

The court noted that, for children to make an ACD to effect or limit the court's parens patriae jurisdiction in relation to children, three things should be noted:

In this case, no ACD was certified for D1, thus none was in force. Therefore, there was no need to consider if and to what extent a binding ACD should affect the court's exercise of its protective jurisdiction.

The hospital filed two affidavits of Simon John Cooke - the affidavits exhibited various passages of D1's medical and social work records and a report prepared by Dr Jacqueline van Dam, the Director of Maternity Services at the hospital. Mr Cooke's affidavit also disclosed that Dr van Dam had arranged for D1 to be examined by Associate Professor Campbell Paul, a consultant infant and child psychiatrist at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, on 28 August 2018 in order to establish his opinion about the capacity of D1 to refuse her consent to the administration of blood or blood products in the course of, or following, the birth of her baby.

Also exhibited to the affidavits were two partially completed ACDs signed by D1, some information pro- vided to D1 about ACDs and the report of Associate Professor Paul. Associate Professor Paul and Dr van Dam were called to give evidence and were both cross-examined. D1 and D2 declined to give any evidence at the application, however D2, through an interpreter during final submissions, made several state- ments to the court that were in the nature of evidence.

D1 was born overseas on 26 August 2001. D1 arrived in Australia in 2009 as an 8-year-old with her family as refugees. Her parents subsequently divorced and D1 lived with her mother and her six siblings. D1 informed the hospital that her pregnancy was planned with her former partner, with whom she had no contact with for 2 months prior to presenting to the hospital.

In early March 2018, D1 was 12 weeks pregnant and she booked the birthing of her baby with the hospital. At this time D1 was 150 cm tall and weighed 44 kg. Dr van Dam reported her to be a ""very small built girl"".

During D1's pregnancy she had been receiving some support from a refugee support agency and from the student wellbeing staff at her school. D1 was continuing with her studies and was focused on her exams until they were completed in mid-June 2018. On 2 July 2018, it was reported that D1 had passed her year 10 exams.

By 9 July 2018, social work records revealed that a person from D1's maternity support group was informed by D1 that she and her family were Jehovah's Witnesses and accordingly, did not believe in blood transfusions. There was no reference to this in the medical records. Social work records dated 31 July 2018 revealed that D1 was advised ""as a priority"" to organise an appointment with either a midwife or an obstetrician to discuss an advance care plan because of the impact her religious beliefs could have on the health of her and her baby. On 1 August 2018, the social work records revealed that the above was reiterated to D1 again.

On 7 August 2018, the social work records confirmed that D1 would not receive blood products and D1 was again advised to organise a obstetric appointment. On 7 August 2018, the medical records for the first time made reference to D1 being a Jehovah's Witness -- by which time D1 was 34.6 weeks pregnant. The medical records stated:

SW notes advise [D1] is Jehovah's Witness. [D1] and mother confirmed this and will decline any blood products. Require OBS appointment to complete advance care directive/ refusal of treatment form and arrange anaesthetic referral.

On 10 August 2018, the medical records noted that D1 attended with D2 to discuss D1's treatment in light of her religious beliefs. The records indicated that D1's brother was included in the conversation by telephone. D1 was asked to have an open discussion with her family and clergy and to put clearly in writing a plan for the blood products she would or would not accept in the event of hypovolemia or volume resuscitation. D1 was asked to return for review on 15 August 2018.

On 15 August 2018, D1 consulted Dr van Dam; D1 was then 36 weeks pregnant. In attendance at this appointment were D1, D2 and a person from D1's Jehovah's Witness community named ""Jill"". According to the medical records, the discussion about blood products was postponed, as D1 was ""not ready to discuss"". Dr van Dam informed D1 that she would need to give specific instructions in relation to what specific products or procedures she would accept. D1 was given written information about ACDs and a form to fill out which outlined her ACD. Dr van Dam noted the need to review the option of having a child psychologist present.

On 22 August 2018, D1 was then 37 weeks pregnant. The medical records were silent as to any further discussion relating to the ACD. The notes stated that the baby was measured as being on the 88th percentile for growth.

In her report, Dr van Dam stated that she had to prompt D1 several times to inform the midwife about her religious beliefs regarding blood or blood product transfusions. Dr van Dam also pointed out to D1 that she had not completed the part on her registration form that required details about her religion.

Dr van Dam's report outlined observations made about D1:

At the consultation on 15 August 2018, Dr van Dam asked D1 why she didn't carry the usual Jehovah's Witness card that states the refusal of blood products. Jill replied on behalf of D1, stating that D1 had not yet been baptised and was not recognised by the church to be able to carry the card. Dr van Dam asked D1 why she had not completed her religious preference on her registration form, and Jill answered for D1 again, stating that D1 had only started her religious studies and was not yet comfortable stating that on the form.

Dr van Dam was concerned that D1 did not have the understanding or conviction to refuse the blood in case of dire emergency. Dr van Dam then arranged for D1 to be assessed by Associate Professor Paul.

Dr van Dam, in her report, identified the risks associated with bleeding during pregnancy; in D1's case being that it is her first baby and a big baby and the labour will possibly be long or obstructed with a retained placenta. Dr van Dam identified that, in the event of a post-partum haemorrhage, the following options were available to a patient:

The court noted evidence from Dr van Dam (whether in a report or as part of oral evidence is unclear) that a 20% loss of total blood volume triggers the need for blood volume resuscitation, as the patient will begin to show signs of hypovolemic shock. Some symptoms, Dr van Dam explained, can be treated by infusion of clear fluids and volume expanders -- but those products do not assist in the transport of oxygen. Transfusion with whole blood and blood products allows replacement not only of the volume but also the oxygen carrying and clotting factors in the blood. Ongoing blood loss without replacement of blood will leave to multi-organ failure and ultimately, death.

Associate Professor Paul is a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist at the Royal Children's Hospital. He saw D1 for 2 hours on 28 August 2018, speaking with her alone extensively.

D1 informed Associate Professor Paul that she had attended the Jehovah's Witness church since she had been in a refugee camp with her family overseas. D1 continued to attend Sunday school at the church whilst living in rural Victoria, but in recent years had attended once or twice a week including taking formal bible studies. D1 informed Associate Professor Paul that she was not yet baptised, but especially liked reading bible stories.

D1 told Associate Professor Paul she had been in a relationship with the father of her child for some months before becoming pregnant; D1 also said she was happy to become pregnant. D1 knew that having sex before marriage was against the values of the Jehovah's Witness community. Although D1 had broken the community rules she said she might be forgiven if she was remorseful. D1 reiterated to Associate Professor Paul a number of times, and in writing, that she did not want to receive any blood or blood products during the course of her pregnancy or delivery, even if there were very serious complications and even if she might die without them.

Associate Professor Paul considered D1 was lucid and fully coherent. He did not believe D1 had any significant ongoing mental health disorder. He examined her attitude towards potential treatment with human blood products. He said D1 willingly completed the ACD in his presence with no pressure from others; D1 was very clear in a statement both written and verbal that should she become acutely ill during pregnancy or delivery and require emergency treatment she would refuse any human blood products.In support of her refusal, D1 went on to quote the part of the bible that refers to the eating or drinking of blood being prohibited, and her desire to make Jehovah happy, stating she would rather die than receive blood products.

Associate Professor Paul asked D1 to consider the potential impact on her baby if there were serious complications during labour. D1 said she had not thought about it; but went on to say that ""if the baby has to die, she has to die"".

Associate Professor Paul believed that D1 had ""a clear and consistent belief that she must not receive human blood products"", although she told him that she held her beliefs freely. He expressed that it could be possible that D1 was to ""some degree"" dependent on her family and community in making decisions about her life so as to accord with the Jehovah's Witness' values and beliefs.[57] This was especially so in the circumstances where D1 had transgressed a major rule not to have a sexual relationship before marriage. Associate Professor Paul thought D1 might have been unduly dependent on her community and feel the need to comply with its strict religious values given her present circumstances.

Associate Professor Paul expressed three important views about D1:

In light of the above factual matrix and aforementioned legislative requirements, Associate Professor Paul was asked to witness D1 completing an ACD made under the MTPDA.[59]Ultimately he felt unable to witness D1's ACD.

Despite not giving oral evidence, through an interpreter in final submissions, D2 made several statements to the court that were in the nature of evidence. D2 was not tested on them.

D2 told the court that she believed:

The evidence relied upon was taken from the affidavits of Mr Cooke, the medical and social work records of the hospital in the report of Dr van Dam and the report of Associate Professor Paul and oral evidence given at the hearing. The court, after considering the evidence, made the following observations about D1:

As a result of these various considerations, the court found it difficult to be confident that D1's expressed choices were the product of an independently formed, carefully considered and long-held adherence to the tenets of the Jehovah's Witness faith.

At the time the judgment was handed down D1 had turned 17 less than a week beforehand. The court noted that evidently, s 24 of the HTA was not at that time engaged and as such the court reminded the parties that, the parens patriae jurisdiction at this time invoked, enjoyed a wider purview regarding the interests of the child beyond mere physical survival. The critical issue for the court to decide was whether it considered that the expressed view of D1 and her mother, D2, should be allowed to direct the hospital in its medical treatment should an emergency arise and D1's life was put at stake without a blood transfusion.

The court considered D1's level of maturity, her understanding of what her best interests are, whether she had sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable her to understand fully what is proposed and the consequences of her decision and what her beliefs are. Ultimately, the court was not satisfied that D1 had a sufficient understanding of the consequences of her choice. The court was further not convinced that D1 had based her choice on a ""maturely formed and entrenched religious conviction.""

The court thought it appropriate that any declaration be made upon the undertakings that the hospital agreed to give; accordingly the court ordered:

For a judgment of only 24 pages, this decision packs a punch in reiterating the far-reaching parens patriae jurisdiction for the ultimate protection of children, and children against their own interests in light of Gillick competence. For those in the medical and legal professions, it serves as a reminder of the important and complex balance between a medical practitioner's duty of care and the observation of religious rights of patients; it also reminds readers that applications of this kind are not taken lightly and there must be a bona fide risk to the patient for an application of this kind to be heard."

Salim spoke to Firstpost about why he continues to stay away from the public eye, why he values awards and what life is like, outside the many stories he is now known for.

A number of your protagonists are loners, the kind who live a lot in the head. You are seen as a recluse yourself, but that is in relation to literary festivals, ceremonies alone. What is Anees Salim in his own circle of friends and family like? Does he step out, 'catch-up' with friends as they say? What is a slow day for you?

I think I am a lot like my own protagonists. And that is indeed a difficult thing as most of them live in the head and suffer within. Irrespective of their age and social standing, my protagonists represent my angst and uncertainties, and sometimes I wonder if their misfortunes will befall me as well.

I have only a few friends and most of them are from my school days, but I hardly confide in them or catch up with them. In fact, my protagonists have more friends than I have. My world is mostly quiet, and I share my time between the office and home.

If I fail to read a page or write at least one hundred words, it is a slow day for me.

Anees Salim

You appear on social media in fits and starts, often with crisp one-liners about things in the news. How have you tackled this animal of social media in your life? You appear and then disappear, why? Does/has it affected your way of thinking, or writing at any level? Do you forward WhatsApp texts?

I use social media for two reasons. Firstly, to express myself when I am irked, pained, or angered. Secondly, I use it as a platform to showcase my books and the news around them. I don't have a website and I don't blog. So Facebook and Twitter come handy when I want to talk about my books. I disappear from social media when it gets on my nerves, and it often does. But being somewhat active on social media has made my writing neither better nor worse. And no, I don't forward WhatsApp messages.

You don't appear to receive awards, but you keep winning them anyway. For a majority of authors licking their lips at the sight of an award, it would be counter-intuitive. Surely, they mean something to you - what is that something? What do awards do for an author and what do they absolutely don't?

I value awards as much as most writers do. Awards are important for me, especially since I don't promote my work through book tours or attend literary festivals. I stay away from award ceremonies just because the mere thought of being among people unsettles me, and I always request my publisher to receive the award on my behalf. I know it is not the best way to respond to a recognition. But I feel powerless to change myself.

As someone who touches both tragedy and comedy in equal measure, how hard is it to not let your novels become political (given it has enough to feed both)? You do follow the news closely (clear from your one-liners on Facebook) and then there was that line about Pakistan in Vanity Bagh. Have you felt the need to address the present? If not, why?

Keeping my books away from the political space comes naturally to me, though I am a keen follower of current affairs. But you will still find a trace of politics in many of my books. The Vicks Mango Tree, for instance, has the Emergency as its backdrop, though it talks more about people than politics. Even in Vanity Bagh, which talks about the presence of a little Pakistan in every big Indian city, I have tried to focus on human angst and insecurities rather than the political issues because I enjoy writing about inner turmoil rather than political ones.

Every writer I have ever spoken to tells me writing is the loneliest task in the world. Do you feel the same - why? You've now had several books published within the space of six-seven years. Do you plan to slow down? What is the endgame for an author according to you, that point where you feel spent?

Yes, writing is indeed a lonely act. For me, that is the best part of writing. You can completely shut the world out, if only for a few hours, and lose yourself in a domain where you are the town planner, gardener, cook, sculptor and executioner, everything you want to be. I dream of doing it for 10-12 hours a day, but I have a day job and my writing hours are restricted to three or less. The moment I finish writing and shut the manuscript I miss the solitude. I hope I will be able to afford longer writing hours one day.

My pace of writing has considerably slowed down over the years. I don't see myself publishing another book before 2020.

There are two schools of opinion on the 'write what you know' paradigm - one for and the other that says it limits imagination. Which side are you on? You've set multiple novels in places you can relate to -- do you feel like writing something that you feel intimidated by? What is that thing - genre, style?

I subscribe to both theories, and actively practice them. I think writing should be a blend of both. Some of my books are about people and places I know rather well while others are purely based on imagination. The Blind Lady's Descendants and The Small-Town Sea are set in my hometown and they are about people I have grown up with. The Vicks Mango Tree and Vanity Bagh are set in a fictitious city called Mangobagh and they are not even remotely connected to anybody I know, though you will find shades of myself in all my books.

Is there a guilty pleasure you enjoy -- read or watch something that you feel embarrassed to share? Writers are often cast in rigid image of themselves - dark, serious types. Do people in your personal circle treat you as such?

No, there is not any kind of guilty pleasure I enjoy.

People complain about me being an introvert. Not that it matters to them, but they still complain. They fiercely criticise my reluctance to receive awards in person. Ironically, these are the same people who used to mock my academic background and crack jokes about my aspirations to be an author.

I don't see myself as either dark or humorous, but my works are generally referred to as dark and humourous, even when they are not.

From rejection to publishing to winning awards with each publication is there now a little pressure of expectation? You may not be visible but more and more people are looking for you - does that or will that affect you in the future?

Every recognition makes me wary of what I write. On top of that, people keep telling me that I am still to write my best book. That puts a little pressure on me.

According to a report by The Epoch Times, students at more than 10 schools in Guizhou Province, one of China's poorer provinces, as well as the neighboring Guangxi region now have to wear ""intelligent uniforms,"" which are embedded with electronic chips that track their movements.

The 'smart' uniforms help school officials, teachers, and parents track the movements of students in real-time, Lin Zongwu, principal of the No. 11 School of Renhuai in Guizhou Province, told the state-run newspaper Global Times on December 20. If students skip school without permission, an alarm will be triggered.

The uniforms have a host of other features including alerting appropriate authorities if a student falls asleep in class, as well as letting parents monitor what their kids' are buying and even setting spending limits.

More Black Mirror-ish is the tracking technology being embedded into the uniforms with databases being set up to match each uniform to each student's face, with facial-recognition equipment being installed at school entrances that can match a student's face with the chip embedded in the uniform. This is to prevent students from exchanging uniforms or trying to manipulate the system.

According to authorities, attendance in schools has seen a surge since the new tech has been implemented now that students are aware that their every movement is being tracked.

While this may sound more and more like a police state's gambit, Chinese officials insist that it is part of the country's emphasis on digital education and smart campuses.

On its official website, Guizhou Guanyu, the firm that designs the chips and embeds, explains that it was established ""to respond to the country's and the Communist Party's call"" for the application of ""smart school campuses""."

Nilanshi,16, entered Guinness World Records with the longest hair on a teenager with 170.5 cm (5 feet 7 inches) long locks. Her feat would be part of 2019 edition of the record book.

Her feat is remarkable as the highly competitive world of global records has quite a narrow margin - the category in which Patel is recognized has been updated twice in 2018 alone according to Guinness World Records website. By the beginning of the year, the record was held by Argentinian Abril Lorenzatti with 152.5 cm long hair. It was broken by 17-year old Keito Kawahara with 155.5 cm. Nilanshi has beaten the record with comfortable margin of 15 cm!

For a class XI (science) student at B-Kanae School in Modasa, her trip to Rome, Italy, to receive the recognition was her first ever air travel, leave alone a foreign trip. ""It was all like a fairytale - it's for nothing that I'm jokingly called Rapunzel,"" grins Nilanshi.

The sole child of a teacher couple Brijeshkumar and Kamini, Nilanshi was raised as the boy of the family. ""It was a traumatic experience at the age of six - when my hair was cut really short by a beautician - I used to throw a fit whenever someone would mention a haircut. After some time, my family also accepted my wish and now I consider the locks as my lucky charm,"" she says.

She admits that the recognition has suddenly put her under the spotlight with photo shoots and media queries. ""But I am focused on the future. I am preparing for JEE to enter an IIT as I want to pursue my dream to be a computer or IT engineer,"" says Nilanshi.

Her father Brijeshkumar says that as a child and teen, Nilanshi has been exposed to varied fields such as painting, music, skating and table tennis. ""We first did not pay much heed to her hair but during a visit to Goa, a number of foreigners requested to get their pictures clicked with her due to her hair. We then started checking online for records and then approached Limca Book of Records and World Record India before approaching Guinness World Records,"" he said.

With great hair comes greater care, says her mother Kamini. ""We attribute her hair to good genes from both sides of the family. We don't really go for much cosmetics - she washes her hair once a week as I oil it thoroughly. She likes both braid and bun,"" she said."

Scientists have developed artificial intelligence (AI) system that can identify people on video, detecting their age and gender more quickly and accurately.

The development has already become the basis for offline detection systems in Android mobile apps, according to researchers from Higher School of Economics in Russia.

Modern neural networks detect gender on videos with a 90 percent accuracy. The situation with age prediction is much more complicated.

Traditional neural networks consider discrete values of age. In each of the video frames, the network estimates the probability of the person in the image being of a certain age.

For example, if in 30 percent of the frames the top prediction of the network is a person's age as 21 years, and in 10 percent as 60 years, its conclusion will be as follows: with a probability of 30 percent this person is 21, and with a probability of 10 percent, he or she is 60.

Due to various conditions of observations or even slight head rotation, prediction of the same person's age in different video frames varies in the range of 5 years, plus or minus.

Researchers found a way to optimise neural networks' operations. They implemented a novel method to aggregate confidence levels produced by the neural network for each frame.

The software systems of facial recognition analysis usually include several separate neural networks. One of them identifies the person, another one determines the gender, etc.

An effective neural network with several outputs has been developed. It solves several tasks at a time: predicts age and gender, and produces a set of 1,000 numbers that uniquely attribute each person and allows them to be distinguished from other people.

According to researchers, this solution will work even on low-performance smartphones."

These days Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub carries this tag. From Raanjhana to Zero via Raees, Zeeshan has played this part with gusto. It is not that this product of National School of Drama hasn't tried to go solo but films like Sameer could not go beyond the critics' praise. He has tried to portray different shades right from his first film when he played a young man high on political patronage in No One Killed Jessica to the upcoming Manikarnika where he will be seen as a remorseless antagonist. Critics love him so much that he was spared even in Thugs of Hindostan.

""People like me because I connect with people, not because I have a boy-next-door kind of face. Performance has its own metaphysical space which is nowhere related to how you look and how you are portrayed in a film. We have ample examples where looks and branding failed because of lacklustre performance,"" maintains the 35-years-old actor. His intense eyes make him a camera-friendly actor, but Zeeshan feels, ""Audience believes in truth and conviction of the actor and performance is something where you can bring in the metaphysical sixth energy which makes a performer reach the hearts of the people. You cannot define it or limit it to attributes like eyes and voice quality.""

With Zero receiving mixed reviews, Zeeshan says the tag 'hero's friend' falls way short of describing the efforts he puts into portraying each character. ""We do compartmentalisation and make things easier for us by using these tags. It is no longer a taboo to play the friend of the lead. Earlier, such characters were not treated well script-wise as most of the time the screenplay revolved around the main actor and the other actor didn't have much substance to play with. I refrain from repeating my characters as you could see that Murari of Raanjhana and Sadiq of Raees are two different characters. Out of the 19 films I have featured in, I played a friend in six and each one of them was different.""

Zeeshan has inherited the love for acting from his parents who were theatre artists. ""Certainly, acting was part of my childhood. I used to dramatise my school stories in my mohalla in Jamia Nagar. I joined Kirorimal College and did theatre for its dramatic society. I had to be clear about my choices because I come from a middle-class family. That is why I applied for NSD to tell my parents that I am serious about my ambition,"" he recalls.

It turned out to be a reality check. ""I was a college favourite but at NSD I was just one aspiring actor among many. I considered myself a failure when I saw many of my classmates were better in movement, voice modulation and carpentry. I was almost in depression when the first year ended. But then I chose to start from zero and took every experience as an opportunity to learn. Theatre education taught me mental calmness, the fact that there is no competition in the field of arts and success is more about taking risks, using your own willpower for skills and technique,"" says Zeeshan.

He talks about his initial years in Mumbai and his search for like-minded people which eventually made him realise his potential. But he refuses to call it a struggle. ""I became an actor in 2005 because of theatre, not in 2011 when I got my first film. People struggle for getting roles in films for getting recognition. You do not seek roles in films in order to become an actor as becoming an actor is a different struggle. That struggle is internal, with yourself,"" avers Zeeshan.

On sharing screen space with big names, Zeeshan says, ""It is helpful when you become a part of big films because they cater to a large mass. I am happy that a large chunk has accepted me and that is why I am getting more roles. As far as working with big names is concerned, I don't think who is in front of me when I am acting. At that time, I am only a character. I may feel something when I am with them after the shoot, and that is different. But it is not necessary to work with big names to remain in business."" He points out the changing norms of the industry where good actors are getting recognition. ""Most of the hit films have ensemble caste and most of the posters feature important characters of the film.""

He maintains as cinema is a director's medium, it is up to the director how he is going to deliver the particular scene. ""It is a very technical medium and a lot is not in the hands of the actors."" He goes on to share his experiences with directors with different approaches to the form. ""In Shahid, we just used to read the script on the day of the shoot and Hansal (Mehta) would let us decide our actions within the scene. Aanand (L. Rai) gives a lot of room for improvisation and I feel a different kind of energy comes when an actor has been given a chance to contribute. On the other hand, Kabir Khan is very thorough with technique and he shoots with the final cut in mind. He knows his shots perfectly. He does not want to shoot extra. So everyone has a different approach,"" he explains.

At a time when statements of artists are being scrutinised, Zeeshan is aware of the consequences of an actor's opinion. For him, it is not about being politically correct all the time. ""I try to bring in my political and social understanding into my artwork as I believe in what Piyush Mishra says: 'Jis kavi ki kalpana mein zindagi ho prem geet, Us kavi ko aaj tum nakaar do.' I am an actor, but I am a citizen too. I have rights and I have duties. As an artist, it is important to say what you feel. Living in a politically neutral zone is safe but if I had to lead a safe life, I would have become an engineer, did a 9 to 5 job and led a routine life.""

Married to theatre artist Rasika Agashe, Zeeshan says he dutifully keeps a work-life balance. ""I have no ambition to reach the heights of stardom. I am more interested in being happy and contributing to society than becoming a celebrity with privileges. Rasika and I live as friends. We discuss what is happening in society and how we can contribute to making it a better place built on trust."""

Modern neural networks detect gender on videos with a 90 per cent accuracy. The situation with age prediction is much more complicated.

Traditional neural networks consider discrete values of age. In each of the video frames, the network estimates the probability of the person in the image being of a certain age.

For example, if in 30 per cent of the frames the top prediction of the network is a person's age as 21 years, and in 10 per cent as 60 years, its conclusion will be as follows: with a probability of 30 per cent this person is 21, and with a probability of 10 per cent, he or she is 60.

Due to various conditions of observations or even slight head rotation, prediction of the same person's age in different video frames varies in the range of 5 years, plus or minus.

Researchers found a way to optimise neural networks' operations. They implemented a novel method to aggregate confidence levels produced by the neural network for each frame.

The software systems of facial recognition analysis usually include several separate neural networks. One of them identifies the person, another one determines the gender, etc.

An effective neural network with several outputs has been developed. It solves several tasks at a time: predicts age and gender, and produces a set of 1,000 numbers that uniquely attribute each person and allows them to be distinguished from other people.

According to researchers, this solution will work even on low-performance smartphones."

The findings may be used by the smartphone manufacturer to create various recommendation systems.

For example, if a user has a considerable amount of content with a toddler, he or she would be offered an advertisement for a children's store.

The function was given beautification by inviting the previous year toppers (belonging to different classes and schools) who had showed outstanding performance at the cluster level so to felicitate them, serving dual purposes of boosting their confidence to perform even better as well as giving them a chance to motivate the outgoing batches to perform better.

One among other invited toppers was also my younger sister, who had topped 8th class exams at cluster level. She surely could have served as a source of inspiration for the outgoing 8th class female folks at that moment. But the story turned out altogether a different one.

Keeping it succinct, she was informed about the event by school authorities (calling her parents), in the morning, the day programme was going to be held. Within no time, her mother made some immediate arrangements, so to help her daughter to attend such a function.

Finally, Principal of the school from where she had completed her class 8th accompanied her to GHSS and asked one of the teachers there to guide her accordingly.

Everything there happened as per schedule except one thing - my sister's name was left out unannounced.

How much embarrassment and worthlessness she would have felt during those few hours was clear from her face once I met her in the evening?

Sad, lost in her thoughts and even nervous as well as angry, she appeared, as she was certainly unable to understand whom to blame.

I instantly called the Principal who accompanied her to the function. Politely, he replied, I am myself unable to understand why they left her name unannounced.

Through him, I got the contact numbers of all the three teachers who were coordinating the programme. Whether you call it their smartness or stupidness, they all put forth a different verbal script.

First one said we were not aware about her attending the function. The second one said we actually were in a bit hurry so forgot. The third one said we actually had no details of her like name, so we couldn't make her announcement.

Puzzled with their responses, I asked third one, few questions which are till now unanswered.

First, why you all put forth three different responses?

Second, if you didn't know her whereabouts then how you informed her about the event and also how you have then arranged a gift for her (as one of the teacher said that the award is lying with me now and I will send it tomorrow)?

Third, let's suppose you don't have her name, then you could have identified her by calling just school name (is a girl belonging to the school -- who topped previous years 8th exam present here, if she is, may come forward to receive her award), but instead choose to skip this all, why?

In an uneducated language he replied, the award was not as costly as you are making out of it and besides what these awards serve? They don't have so much importance. Send your sister to our Higher Secondary tomorrow I will award her during morning assembly.

To all such kind of teachers I say, efforts put in work by any person, when recognized and respected, bring happiness as well as motivation. Efforts that mostly yield the great and desired results are actually ""priceless"", as no rate/award can ever be fixed for the emotions and struggles linked with them.

Efforts as such are made by all from a ""peasant to a lawmaker"", from a ""doctor to an administrator"", from a ""student to a teacher"" and so on.

But among all such efforts, is an effort of students, very delicate and fragile in nature, which needs ""recognition and support"", so to help them grow and succeed.

Surely awards don't have too much materialistic value, but it is the emotions that get associated with them, that motivate a person during hard times to come, that are priceless.

Surely teachers like you can't understand the value of an award, as your mind can't go beyond materialistic value.

I would suggest, if in future you host any award function, do present some valuable gifts to students, worth lakhs, so that at least you can't say after your carelessness that the awards were not so worthy.

Finally, on December 20, 2018 the same award reached through one of our close relative to my home. What wondered me again was that they had not even at this time a modicum of regret for their carelessness that humiliated and shook the confidence of a growing and budding student; as one of the teacher at this time used a new verbal script of ""unfortunately could not announce her name as it was a bit confusing one with little tough pronunciation."" How shameless they are?

The award no more belongs to my home (my sister), as it lacks all such attached emotions (confidence, strength, and enthusiasm) that it could invoke on just looking at it.

Getting it at the right time would have made it like a souvenir, worth remembering. It is now just like other ordinary items. The attached emotions of zeal, enthusiasm and dedication, which might have got attached with it, died the moment it was snatched away from my sister.

Dear teachers you have posted it on a wrong address, we don't own it anymore. The award belongs to you. Feel free to get it back any time.

P.S: Truly said, lies don't last long. As I was having an argument with the third teacher, he in his closing argument spoke his heart out, as his tongue slipped with my sister's name and I stopped him instantly and questioned how you know now my sister's name?"

Ramdev's schools to be first beneficiary.

New Delhi: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev's long-drawn struggle to secure official recognition for Vedic schools and gurukuls is set to end soon, as the Modi government is ready with a Vedic Board along the lines of the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE).

The board will be in charge of granting affiliation to Vedic schools and gurukuls, apart from creating more such schools. The syllabus at a Vedic school is a mix of the traditional and the modern, comprising of Indian scriptures, Vedas, Upanishads apart from basic mathematics, economics and languages among others.

There are many such schools in India almost all of which are unregulated.

Sources in the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry said the guidelines for the board's functioning have been finalised and will be released soon.

""Apart from granting affiliation to existing Vedic schools, the board's mandate would also be to set up more schools that impart modern education along with teaching Vedas to students,"" said a source familiar with the development.

""The plan has been finalised but the government is cautious in releasing it at this time because of the upcoming elections.""

Sources in the ministry also said that Ramdev's schools will be the first ones to get affiliation under the board, likely to be functional from the 2019 academic year.

Ramdev had been pushing for a separate board for Vedic schools since 2015 after he decided to open a chain of gurukuls across the country. He and his team had also held consultations with the HRD Ministry to suggest ways in which the board can be formulated.

Ramdev runs Acharyakulam, a residential Vedic school for students between classes 5 and 12 at Haridwar. He plans to establish 700 such schools across the country that will follow the Acharyakulam model.

""Swamiji (Baba Ramdev) was trying for this for a very long time and finally the government has agreed to his opinion. He gave a number of representations to the government to prove the need of such schools in the Indian education system,"" Acharya Balkrishna, Ramdev's aide and business partner told ThePrint.

""Ten schools are already working presently, one in Ranchi will take off from the next academic session.""

The HRD Ministry had started working on the board in 2016 but the project was shelved after certain objections from the then secretary, education, S.C. Khuntia, who pointed out that establishing a board would open the doors to corruption in the school education sector, sources in the ministry said.

It was revived in May after HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar discussed the setting up of the board at the 'Virat Gurukul Sammelan' where the RSS top brass and other BJP leaders had gathered. Just two days ago, on 22 December, Javadekar announced the plan during the inauguration of a school at Baruipur in West Bengal.

""We want to create a board that imparts education with a mix of knowledge from the Vedas and modern education. We are working towards creating a board that can do this,"" the minister said.

A central government panel had earlier this year suggested that children studying in madrasas and Vedic schools should be considered ""out of school"". This was one of the major suggestions that emerged in the report of the Central Advisory Board of Education (CABE) sub-committee, which was submitted to the ministry. The CABE is the largest decision-making body on all matters related to education.

There are a large number of children attending unrecognised schools/institutions, which may or may not provide regular education. Children attending all such institutions like Vedic pathshalas, gompas, madrasas should be considered 'out of school', the report had said. The committee was headed by former MoS HRD Upendra Kushwaha.

Setting up of a separate Vedic Board will also help such schools in getting recognition."

A sliver of sunlight falls on her face but she does not move away. ""I like the sun,"" says the director of the Sharjah Biennale Foundation. But she does look a bit harried. In 20 minutes, she has to hold a conference of the International Biennial Association (IBA), of which she is the president. She is grabbing lunch and talking to four journalists as well as a Biennale volunteer, while a photographer takes some pics.

Interestingly, Sheikha Hoor had a particular reason to hold the IBA meeting at Fort Kochi. ""I thought it was important for people who had not come to the Kochi Biennale to come and have a look,"" she says. Sheikha is a fan. And she has attended all four editions. ""From the very beginning, the founders [Bose Krishnamachari and Riyas Komu] had a good idea and focus and they started with good intentions,"" she says. ""The quality of the installations has been increasing through every edition.""

Asked about the international trends in art now, Sheikha Hoor, who is the daughter of Dr Sheikh Sultan Al Qasimi, Ruler of Sharjah, says, ""Nowadays, it is becoming more and more important for a Biennale to be about the city and the people. In Venice and other major biennales, initially, it was all about tourism. But now that idea has changed.""

As a newly-appointed curator of the second edition of the Lahore Biennale in 2020, Sheikha Hoor is on the lookout for new talent. ""At the Kochi Biennale, you see a lot of artists from India and from countries like Bangladesh,"" she says. ""This is a chance for us to discover new and interesting work. And it is a platform of opportunity for the artists, too.""

And the opportunity is there because the art world is no longer Western-oriented. ""Now, a lot of major museums and art festivals in the West are looking to Asia, Africa and Latin America,"" she says. ""There is a major shift in focus."" As for the Sharjah Biennale, Sheikha Hoor has a multicultural vision. ""It is not only about the Arab world, it is also about South Asia and Africa,"" she says. ""There are so many cultural influences. It is really important to have a wider viewpoint. And we want to support artists from all over.

Arts and culture are one of the few ways where we can overcome boundaries like class, status, race and gender. We can bring people together."" As to whether ordinary people are really interested in art, Sheikha Hoor says, ""What we are doing in Sharjah, for example, is not for the people of today but those of tomorrow. It is an investment for future generations. The Sharjah Biennale started in 1993. I took over in 2002. And I see the changes."" More and more people are now interested in art. ""There are so many young people who come to see the Biennale and our other exhibitions,"" she says. ""When we started out there was a staff of five. Now there are 222 people working the year around. That's how big it has got.""

Regarding the ongoing Kochi Biennale, Sheikha Hoor says, ""It is very nice. There are many interesting works. The artists I liked the most were BV Suresh and Madhavi Parekh. I liked the way the way Madhavi told her stories, as well as her technique. I might invite her for Lahore.""

Lastly, there was good news for Bose. To be a part of the IBA, you have to hold at least three editions. ""Since Kochi is now in its fourth edition we have appointed Bose as one of our Board members,"" says Sheikha Hoor.

A happy Bose says, ""It is a recognition of the work we have done since the inception.""

On Sheikha

An achiever Sheikha Hoor Al Qasimi did a degree from the Slade School of Fine Art, London (2002), a Diploma in Painting from the Royal Academy of Arts, London (2005) and an MA in Curating Contemporary Art from the Royal College of Art, London (2008). Sheikha Hoor is also on the Board of Directors for MoMA PS1, New York; KW Institute for Contemporary Art, Berlin; Darat Al Funun, Amman and Ashkal Alwan, Beirut. She is also the Chair of the Advisory Board for the College of Art and Design, University of Sharjah and member of the Advisory Board for Khoj International Artists' Association, New Delhi. She speaks nine languages: English, Arabic, Japanese, Mandarin, Tagalog, French, Polish, Russian and German. Sheikha Hoor is currently a member of the Prince Claus Award Committee and on the jury for the Bonnefanten Award for Contemporary Art (2018)."

In 2025, four months pregnant Aparajita is feeling peckish and stops by at a Mumbai convenience store for a mid-morning snack. She picks up a biscuit pack and taps it on her fitness band to check the ingredients and makes sure she is getting the right nutrients and that it is safe for her baby. Yuka, a France-based mobile app is already evaluating the quality of your purchases. It offers an independent evaluation of the food you buy based on three criteria of nutritional quality, presence of risk additives and biological dimension of the product.

Back home that evening, she accidentally drops her medicine bottle. She asks her artificial intelligence (AI)-powered 'smart speaker' to have the medicines delivered immediately. Before she is halfway done with an episode of her favourite show on Netflix, a drone delivers the medicines to her house.

Well, this is just a peek into what already is happening. Fact is, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will completely transform the shopping experience, replacing today's pain points with captivating, interactive experiences that inform, entertain and save time and money. Moreover, yes, challenges of security, privacy and confidentiality will need to be addressed -- not just by laws but also by a new contract between corporates and consumers. By having specific, transparent, and positive-consent based sharing of personal information with providers who have limited and contractual access to individual data, the drudgery of shopping will be replaced with high-experience, time-efficient visits to retail outlets.

Again, not all of this is in the future. Globally, smart speakers is a $4.3 billion market, expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate, as per data from Allied Market Research. In India, during the second quarter (July-September) of fiscal year 2019, IDC reported that shipments of smart speakers saw a 43% quarter on quarter growth. Same day delivery is, of course, mainstream; according to a Dropoff survey, in 2017, 17% of US consumers used same-day delivery, while 31% used it in 2018.

Most e-commerce players are currently piloting drone projects in controlled environments. The big challenge is regulations, as most countries require drones to be within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the drone operator. The Indian government too has taken baby steps by allowing commercial use of drones. As we move ahead, the regulatory restrictions on the role of drones will need to be further streamlined and detailed, while at the same time security and safety issues will need to be balanced since the potential of abuse is high.

Meanwhile in Surat, Neeta, 23, walks into an apparel store to buy a dress for a party she has to attend that evening. Taking out her mobile phone, she scans bar codes of the dresses she likes and sees a 3D image of herself on the mirror-screen. Just a click shows her digital avatar wearing her favourite dresses on the screen. She can turn and twirl with her 3D avatar doing the same. Finally, she selects a couple of outfits on the mobile and walks out of the shop. On her way out, she smiles at the exit mirror. Her identity is verified, payment made seamlessly and product dropped into a lockbox in her apartment lobby -- the bar code on the package gave access to the delivery person to enter the lobby and access the lockbox. Neeta is all set to dazzle the crowd in her new outfit.

This picture of the future augurs well for the environment. With less packaging, less dead inventory, and replenishment-based fulfilment at home (less wastage), the carbon footprint of consumption will not grow as much as it does today.

Known as Memory Mirrors, this smart AR mirror enables customers to try on a variety of clothes in different colours, virtually, with a 360-degree experience. The same AR technology is also letting customers try on custom-fit glasses and simulate makeup products on a user's face to show what they would look like in rea world.

Alibaba, meanwhile, has piloted smile recognition technology in KFC outlets where Alipay customers can smile to pay. Alibaba has recently collaborated with Megvii Technology Ltd on designing smart mirrors.

Changing consumption story

In 2005, the income distribution in India was quite like the Eiffel Tower -- a very broad base, tapering quickly and drastically to a very thin top. In 2005, 7 in 10 households were in the ""low income"" group -- a subsistence level of consumption where there was little discretionary spend. Today, we have progressed to the great pyramids in income distribution. We are now at a level where 6 in 10 households belong to either the middle or upper income groups, and they have steadily powered growth in consumption across all categories.

Over the next 10 odd years, we envision that the pyramid will morph again, and income distribution will take the shape of a diamond. This burgeoning expansion of the middle class will result in buoying the middle class bucket to 300 million, now accounting for over 80% of our households. Existing households becoming more prosperous will equally drive this increase in the middle class, and the creation of new, young households where youngsters will be more educated and better employed than their parents were.

This macro metamorphosis of the Eiffel Tower into a pyramid and then to a diamond will be further embellished by the internet and digital inclusion. By 2030, over 1 billion Indians will have access to the internet. As more of India is 'connected', more technology-savvy consumers will begin to define shopping and consumption trends. Digitally influenced purchases will become the norm; almost 40% of all purchases will be digitally influenced in the near future.

Where virtual is real

Advances in mobile telephony will present new opportunities as they run an array of offerings starting from mobile-armed sales staff to mobile-enhanced product reviews, mobile-responsive websites, and discounts on demand via apps while shopping within a store. Mobile accessories are also redefining the digital shopping experience, making it simple, fast and fun, while not requiring any physical interface.

By 2025, when 20-year-old Sunil enters a leading branded shoe store, and is unable to find the right size, he gives his measurements and the 3D printing machine starts printing out customized shoes for him. While they wait for it, he goes over to the basketball 'stadium' in the store to shoot some hoops.

His shoe is done in a few minutes and he decides to try it on the VR running track, also at the same outlet. After a quick round ""around"" the track, he is convinced that the pair is meant for him. Meanwhile, the sportswear company has registered his speed and calculated the discount based on the boy's performance.

VR is already a reality in shopping. A US-based adventure products company is putting VR into its stores to make shopping an immersive experience in which customers form emotional connections. In some US stores, it had customers virtually travel to a national park, where they accompanied rock-climbers in a 360-degree VR experience with 3D sound. In a Korean store, it had customers shopping for winter jackets sit down on a sled and go on a virtual dog sledding experience, after which they surprised the customers by launching them straight into a real dog sledding adventure through the mall, ending in catching the jacket they had been trying on at the finish line.

Some others are using AR to let customers virtually place furniture in their homes and assess how it would look. For instance, one retailer's app generates true-to-size reproductions of its products within the customer's home, from a couch against the wall to see how it might fit, to a ceiling lamp for how it matches the rest of the room's aesthetics.

In conclusion

Close to home, smart wearables are already seeding in India at a rapid pace. As per IDC, the second quarter of 2018 saw 1 million shipments of smart wearables, witnessing a 40% quarter on quarter growth.

In a corner of Patna, Rajesh, 45, a ride-hailing electric cab driver has just reached home to listen to his 17-year-old daughter recount how she picked up the T-shirt that her dad had promised for her birthday. At the metro station on her way back from school, she photographed a cool T-shirt ad and searched for 'similar designs' on a shopping site. The site, which had evolved machine learning capabilities, threw up different options. She selected a few she liked and shared on her chat group. After getting her friends' approval, she is curious to understand the specific fit and pings customer service of the shopping site. The customer service bot answered all her questions and she placed the order, which was delivered within a few hours.

Indeed bots will play a crucial role in the future shopping experience and provide a conversational commerce service on various messaging and social media platforms that customers use daily. Social media is becoming shoppable, with some startups making any post a kick-off for a fast checkout. Meanwhile, startups like Bringhub now place the most relevant products on any given page on the web. Leveraging natural language processing and image recognition, Bringhub analyzes web pages and can pick out exactly the most relevant products to feature on a webpage based on the webpage's content, letting retailers bring exactly the right shopping journey to the customer browsing anything anywhere on the web.

These advances are as much behavioural as they are about technology. In addition, none of these are in the 'yet to be built' category: each one referenced is already being tested somewhere in the world. It is only a matter of time before they become part of our retail experience too."

Signs directed people to where they could sit, stand, get a sip of water. They reinforced the social order of an American hierarchy -- how people were seen, what they were called, what they had been before the Republic was founded and what was presumed they could never be.

It was with the weight of this history in her bones that Michelle Obama walked onto the world stage as the first black woman to become first lady when her husband, Barack Obama, was sworn in as president in January 2009.

""Becoming"" is refined and forthright, gracefully written and at times laugh-out-loud funny, with a humbler tone and less name-dropping than might be expected of one who is on chatting terms with the queen of England. One of Obama's strengths is her ability to look back not from the high perch of celebrity or with the inevitability of hindsight but with the anxieties of the uncertain.

She was born Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, in January 1964, during the term of Lady Bird Johnson. Her family lived on the second floor of a brick bungalow owned by a prim great-aunt and her fastidious husband. Her father, Fraser Robinson III, worked for the city tending boilers for a water filtration plant, and her mother, Marian Shields Robinson, stayed at home looking after Michelle and her older brother, Craig. The Shields and Robinson families had fled the Jim Crow South for Chicago decades before, during the Great Migration of African-Americans out of the South to the North and West.

Like many Americans, Obama's parents made do with what they had and poured their energy into their children, who they hoped would fulfil the families' as yet unrealised aspirations. The parents bought them a set of Encyclopaedia Britannica and insisted on proper diction.

Upstanding though the Robinsons may have been, they watched as moving vans showed up at the houses of one neighbour after another, and soon the remaining white residents along with the better-off black ones peeled off for the suburbs. Michelle's family stayed on, Craig attending Catholic school and Michelle qualifying for an elite magnet high school. We follow her as she logs three hours round trip to the school, switching buses at Michigan Avenue in the thick of rush hour, noticing the ""men and women in smart outfits -- in suits and skirts and clicking heels -- carrying their coffee to work with a bustle of self-importance,"" and admiring ""how determined they looked."" In time, she would see the problem with caring about what other people think. For now, she was following the path she had assigned herself and, by 25, was a lawyer at Sidley & Austin in Chicago, with an office on the 47th floor, an assistant, a wine subscription service, Armani suits. And, ""because you can, you buy yourself a Saab.""

One day, a senior partner asked her to mentor an incoming summer associate who, like her, was black and from Harvard but had an unusual name. Their first meeting did not get off to a promising start. He was late, for one thing. ""Any sign of this guy?"" she asked her assistant. ""Girl, no,"" the assistant called back, amused. There had been a lot of advance hype at the firm about Barack Obama, which only made her sceptical. She had seen his picture in the summer staff directory. ""I checked out his photo,"" she writes. ""A less-than-flattering, poorly lit head shot of a guy with a big smile and a whiff of geekiness -- and remained unmoved."" As was expected of mentors, she took him to lunch, at which he did something that seemed to foreclose any romantic possibilities. ""Appallingly, at the end of lunch, Barack lit a cigarette,"" she writes, ""which would have been enough to snuff any interest, if I'd had any to begin with.""

How their office relationship turned into a quick-moving romance that summer is a delight to read, even though, or perhaps because, we know the outcome. His cerebral intensity was clear from the start. After some theoretical disquisitions on the subject of marriage, in which she was the traditionalist and he was, well, not, he surprised her in a sweetly clever scene that could be out of a Hollywood rom-com. Then, in 1996, a seat opened up in the Illinois State Senate, and Barack wanted to run for it. Michelle stood her ground as best she could.

True to her fears, the bigger the two of them got, the greater the scrutiny and criticism. When he finally won the Democratic nomination, she joined him on stage in Minnesota and greeted him with what she considered ""a playful fist bump,"" only to see it interpreted on Fox News as ""a terrorist fist jab.""

There can be few African-Americans, or other marginalised people, who would not nod in recognition at some aspect of her story. But just as important, her family's devotion and work ethic, the steadfastness and sacrifice, are evidence of how much we all have in common if we could but see it.

To this day, when people speak to her mother, Marian Robinson, about the success of her children, coming out of the South Side of Chicago as they did, she is quick to correct them. ""They're not special at all,"" Robinson says. ""The South Side is filled with kids like that."" And, one might add, so is America."

As expected, this enraged China. While the Chinese foreign ministry warned of consequences, the National People's Congress (NPC) issued a statement that the US act was against the basic norms of international relations and a gross interference in China's domestic affairs. It said that China will take ""forceful measures to resolutely safeguard its own interests"".

As everyone knows, most foreigners who seek to enter Tibet are routinely rejected, and those who do get in are forced to stay on strictly controlled official tours, where the true situation of the Tibetan people is hidden from them. And, China has never been open to any discussion on Tibet.

Of course, the new US law sounds like bullying. But it embarrasses China and hurts it internationally.

It needs to be hurt and it's high time it is bullied.

For decades, China has been getting away with whatever it wants, cocking a snook at all international fair practices, while enslaving its 1.4 billion people. With its massive economic and technological strength, and its total disregard for (perhaps incomprehension of) all human values, it is a giant threat to the future of mankind.

Let's face it. The initial stages of China's incredible economic growth were powered a great deal by history's greatest loot of intellectual property, much of it state-sponsored. With economic growth came imperial ambitions. China has been flouting all international laws in the South China Sea, invading other countries' waters, building artificial islands and militarising them. Its ""string of pearls"" strategy of establishing a zone of influence across the Indian Ocean, from the Chinese mainland to Port Sudan, encircling India, is already in action. Its Belt and Road Initiative uses the same strategy across Central Asia into Eastern Europe.

And while it grows its global empire, its repression of its own people is reaching horrifying heights. Its ""social credit system"", already in place in many areas, is supposed to be completed by 2020. Every citizen will be watched every moment. Algorithms working on rules fed into it by the state will crunch data to rate the individual's ""trustworthiness"". ""Untrustworthy"" behaviour ranges from ticketless travel, jaywalking, smoking in non-smoking areas, playing too many video games (you are an idle person and the Chinese state does not condone idleness), not walking your dog on a leash or letting it bark too much and, of course, any talk or social media posts that hint at criticism of the state.

Punishments range from travel bans, no bank loans, job loss, denying your children a good education, and being publicly shamed as a bad citizen by having your face and name plastered on billboards. According to a State Council policy document: ""If trust is broken in one place, restrictions are imposed everywhere.""

One does not have to read a lot of dystopian science fiction to imagine to what level such measures can be taken to create a nightmarish unfree society in the future. But that society already exists in Xinjiang in northwestern China. This is where about 10 million Uighurs live, a non-Chinese minority that practices a moderate form of Sunni Islam. The Chinese have been carrying out a ""de-extremification"" project in Xinjiang for years. Today, more than one million Uighurs are in ""re-education camps"" where inmates are subjected to brainwashing -- learning Communist texts and singing songs praising the Chinese state and supreme leader Xi Jinping. Torture is common. And ""enrolment"" in these camps is often arbitrary -- local authorities are given target numbers and people are picked up randomly and imprisoned.

There is one police station per 500 Uighurs. No one can move in or out of any village or town without having their identification cards checked. Facial recognition technology is used to track residents' movements. All cellphones are collected periodically to download information from them. All Uighur passports have been confiscated. It is illegal not to watch state television.

The government has banned certain Muslim names for babies. For instance, if parents name a baby ""Mohammad"" or ""Islam"", the child will not get a school admission. Young men are not allowed to grow beards. No one is allowed to have ""abnormally long beards"". The government actively encourages drinking and smoking, since the more devout among the Muslims are abstemious.

The man in charge is a Communist Party boss called Chen Quanguo, whose last job, not surprisingly, was restoring order and control in Tibet.

The Saudi Arabians, who spend millions of petrodollars every year to promote Wahhabism across the world, are remarkably silent about the plight of their Muslim brethren in China.

US trade sanctions are hurting China, whose economy had already started slowing down. Trump is not a statesman by any stretch of imagination, but he is the first US president to have had the guts to take on the evil dragon head-on. For yes, this dragon is evil. And the more powerful it gets, the worse it will be for the world."

After a phone conversation with Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, Trump said Sunday morning in a tweet, that, ""we discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area"". But, he added, ""they are coming home"".

President Trump announced earlier in the week, also after a phone call with President Erdogan, that the US will be pulling out its 2,000 troops stationed in Syria to fight the Islamic State (which is also called ISIS -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). No timelines had been offered since.

But the stunning decision, which was opposed by most of the president's senior aides and advisers and was not discussed with allies, was greeted by a storm of criticism at home and abroad.

Secretary Mattis, who had opposed the decision, resigned in protest after failing to persuade the president to change his mind. He should get himself some one who was more ""aligned"" with his own thinking, he told the president in a resignation letter that has received widespread attention, and irritated Trump.

So much that he wants him out sooner than February till when Mattis had offered to stay to enable the president to look for a successor. Trump announced on Twitter that Shanahan, who is currently serving as deputy secretary of defense, will take charge from January 1. ""Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!""

Before moving to the Pentagon, Shanahan had served as senior vice president for supply chain and operations at Boeing, starting at the company in 1986, according to his biography on the US department of defense website. His assignments there included a stint as vice president and general manager of the 787 Dreamliner, leading the programme during a critical period.

Shanahan holds a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington, and two advanced degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology: a Master of Science degree in mechanical engineering, and an MBA from MIT's Sloan School of Management.

Mattis, his predecessor, was a celebrated US marine general.

Shanahan is now the third senior member of the Trump administration charged with an ""acting"" assignment, following -- acting chief of staff of White House Mick Mulvaney and acting attorney general Matt Whittaker (Trump has named William Barr to assume full-time charge when confirmed by the senate)."

One morning in November, Khetrabasi Behera, 69, and his wife Kausalya Behera, 60, crossed a crocodile-infested creek in the midst of Odisha's Bhitarkanika National Park, on the way to the village they once called home.

Kausalya Behera carried some kerosene in a bottle, and her husband had a few belongings in plastic sacks hanging from a pole slung across his shoulder. The couple planned to stay in the village for a week to fish, their only means of livelihood left in a place waiting to be devoured by the Bay of Bengal.

""With our crop land lost to the sea, we are landless now,"" said Khetrabasi Behera, who wore a white shirt and a lungi folded up to his knees. ""We go to Satabhaya to catch fish, crab and prawn. We have to eke out our living.""

The couple were about 8 km away from Satabhaya, a once picturesque coastal village in Kendrapara district from which they had been relocated by the state government last year. They were among 571 families who had been resettled by April in Bagapatia, a colony created by the government for people displaced by coastal erosion in the area.

But since there are no jobs or alternative livelihoods in the settlement for the villagers, and neither has the state government provided them with land to cultivate, or compensation for fields lost to the sea, most of the resettled villagers earn their livelihoods by catching fish, crabs and prawns from the inundated fields where they used to grow paddy not so long ago. Most of them walk 12 km to Satabhaya village, and back, almost every day for this. During their visits, they also attend to their cows and buffaloes who have been left behind to graze on land that turns more saline each year.

The sea has been eroding the coastline in Kendrapara district for decades, contaminating groundwater and devouring villages and paddy fields that have provided homes and incomes to thousands of people. The erosion is particularly acute near Satabhaya village.

In a report released in July, the National Centre for Coastal Research, which surveyed 6,031 km of India's 7,517 km coastline between 1999 and 2016, found that 33% of the coast witnessed erosion, most of it on the Bay of Bengal side. Odisha alone has lost 28% of its 485 km coastline during this period, according to the report.

Ranjan Panda, a water activist and researcher in Odisha, said that the situation in Satabhaya is a test of how the government is responding to the rise in the sea level and its impact on coastal residents.

Though the coastal erosion is largely attributed to climate change, many environmentalists suspect that development projects in the 1960s such as the construction of the Paradip Port - just over 80 km from Satabhaya - and the felling of mangroves for other development projects, may have aggravated the process. No proper studies, however, have been taken up in this regard.

""Though global warming has undeniably affected erosion across the world, at the local level, as in the case of Satabhaya, the contribution of development activities at eco-sensitive coastal zones cannot be ruled out,"" said Ranjan Panda.

The word ""satabhaya"" means seven brothers. This refers to the seven villages that stood here originally, which had a robust economy revolving around agriculture and fishing, according to villagers. Tehsil records show that these villages were called Sanagahiramatha, Mohanpur, Habeli Chintamanipur, Gobindpur, Kaduanasi, Saheb Nagar and Paramanandapur. They were spread across 875.16 acres of land (not including cropland).

But as the sea relentlessly eroded the coastline, starting from the 1960s, the people of these seven villages moved inland and formed five newer villages - Kanhupur, Satabhaya, Barahipur, Rabindrapalli and Magarakanda. Satabhaya was the gram panchayat headquarters. Today, of these five villages, only Satabhaya remains. The last village to disappear into the sea was Kanhupur, in 2011. Gone with these villages were around 600 houses, more than 2,400 acres of paddy fields, several temples, a 125-year-old high school and a summer palace belonging to local royalty.

As the erosion continued, the presence of the Bhitarkanika National Park and the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary on their western periphery meant that the villagers could not move further inland. This is when the government decided to relocate them to Bagapatia.

Many village residents say they have been displaced multiple times because of the ingression of the sea.

Kalindi Charan Behera, 79, who now lives in Bagapatia, said he must have shifted homes 10 times during his lifetime.

Another village elder, Krusna Chandra Behera, has vivid memories of how the topography in the region has changed since he was young boy. ""I clearly remember that between 1943 and 1945, waves from the sea started pushing enormous [amounts of] sand from the beach into the palace,"" said the 84-year-old former teacher who moved to his newly-constructed concrete house in Bagapatia in July 2017. ""Initially the king tried to clear the palace of the sand deposits...But then he saw the futility of the exercise and abandoned the structure completely.""

By 1948, the palace was submerged.

At that time, the Panchubarahi temple, home to Satabhaya's presiding deities, was more than a kilometre away from the sea. Now the beach is less than 50 meters away from the temple. The deities too were shifted to Bagapatia in April.

The Odisha government woke up to the reality of sea erosion in the area about 15 years ago, when it came up with a plan to rehabilitate the villages at Bagapatia, which was then a 100-odd acre plot of marshy land from where several prawn farms operated.

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik laid the foundation stone for the colony in 2002 but things did not move for several years after that. Land acquisition did not begin for about eight years due to complications related to acquiring a chunk of private land. At the same time, the government stopped all development activities in Satabhaya. The reasoning for this was that it was no point wasting money on a village that was destined to be abandoned.

In the mid-2000s, the slow process of relocation and lack of development in Satabhaya forced more than half of its total population of 3,000 residents - that is, those who could afford it - to move out to Okilapala, located 10 km away near the highway.

The villagers who were relocated by April did so with government assistance. According to Nihar Ranjan Mallick, the tehsildar (land revenue officer) of Rajnagar tehsil, which Bagapatia is part of, the state government has provided each resettled family with plots measuring just over 400 sq m and financial assistance of Rs 1.35 lakh to construct their houses. He added that the state government has also built a high school, a cyclone shelter and a market complex in the colony and provided it with piped drinking water through the rural water supply and sanitation department.

The new colony is a barren blend of concrete and thatched houses, a sharp contrast to Satabhaya's picture-postcard views. Its residents criticise its lack of infrastructure. They say drinking water, for instance, is provided for just 30 minutes every day.

But government officials do not seem too sympathetic to their complaints.

""The people expect the government to do everything,"" said Mandardhara Mahalik, the Rajnagar block development officer responsible for infrastructure, rehabilitation and development in Bagapatia. ""In such rehabilitation programmes, the support of the people is also vital.""

Mahalik said that the government has connected homes with piped water and is developing infrastructure such as ponds, roads and other amenities. He added that the majority of families from the village have now been relocated and any problems in the colony would be resolved soon.

Ranjan Panda said that people who are internally displaced by the impacts of climate change struggle for recognition and redress across the world because there is no immediacy to their plight. ""The government considers such people just as any other displaced people,"" he said, referring to those displaced by mining or other development projects. ""Except for normal revenue laws, there are no specific laws to categorise these kinds of displaced people and evaluate the quantum of loss they suffer in terms of livelihood.""

The rehabilitation process in Satabhaya is still not over, with a few people still living in the village.

Revenue officers tasked with identifying the land for relocation and enumerating the beneficiaries, say that the list of families to be relocated was prepared taking 2011 as the base. But in the last seven years those numbers have expanded due to marriages and births. After examining claims and physical enumeration two years ago, the state administration recommended that another 148 families still living in Satabhaya be relocated to the new colony.

Unable to cope without basic amenities in Satabhaya, some families that have not been relocated officially have shifted to homes of their relatives in Bagapatia. Some others have sent their children to live with friends and relatives in the resettlement colony so that they can attend school.

The Satabhaya gram panchayat office now operates from Bagapatia. People still living in the village have to travel here to collect their rations under the public distribution system, as well as to access their pensions and other state entitlements.

In the late 1990s, local wildlife authorities declared Satabhaya a wildlife zone and banned fishing, further diminishing available livelihood opportunities. The residents of Satabhaya then started migrating locally to look for work.

But as crop land and the lack of infrastructure to transport agricultural products to markets outside Satabhaya continued to shrink, youth began migrating further away, for instance, to plywood factories in Kerala. ""At least 400 youth of Satabhaya are in Kerala now,"" said Kailash Mallick, who also works in Kerala but had returned to Bagapatia temporarily after floods ravaged the state in August. ""They all work in plywood factories earning between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per month.""

Khetrabasi and Kausalya Behera's two adult sons are also working in the southern state. They send their parents back around Rs 1,000 every month, which just about covers the cost of their monthly groceries.

Manorama Behera's husband Jagabandhu Behera is in Kerala too. The couple have not been allotted a plot in Bagapatia so Manorama Behera still stays in Satabhaya, living alone in a thatched hut that she painstakingly repairs with mud periodically to prevent it from collapsing. Her two sons live in the resettlement colony with her brother-in-law so that they can attend school. The family once owned five acres of land, which have been claimed by the sea.

With most people gone, it is difficult to live in the village, said Manorama Behera. ""The tube wells, our only sources of drinking water, are getting defunct,"" she said.

In the last 20 years, at least 10 tube wells in the area have been damaged by the ingression of the sea. One such tubewell near the beach in Satabhaya looks unlike any other because of erosion: it is a 15-feet tall pipe awkwardly jutting out of the ground; its height indicating the extent of erosion that has taken place. The villagers still collect water from this well painstakingly - a rope is tied to its handle, a pipe attached to its nozzle.

The village as such looks deserted, with its many houses and the village school building crumbling. Sand dunes cover several homes that lie near the beach. There is no electricity and the roads do not seem to have been metalled in years. But there are still some traces of life. A few mud and thatched houses are regularly maintained to keep them habitable so that those who have left - like Khetrabasi Behera and Kausalya Behera - can stay in them when they return for short periods.

The villagers know their livelihoods are shrinking fast. They cultivate shrimp in their inundated lands despite the threat of arrest and extortion by wildlife officials. They have also been selling their milch cows and buffaloes as the grazing fields turn more saline. There are now just 100 animals, down from 400 a few years back. ""Ultimately, the whole area is doomed,"" said Khetrabasi Behera. ""And with it we are too."""

Charlie Munger, (Interview with BBC, 2012- taken from Chapter 14- Big Mistakes, The Best Investors and Their Worst Investments, Michael Batnick, Bloomburg Publishing, May 22, 2018- John Wiley)

If you are like 99% of all citizens, you earn your money each day by working at an occupation. There are all kinds of jobs in the world and one is fortunate if you are able to have a profession that you enjoy doing. Most people do not like their jobs but they have to pay the bills, so you endure and cope with the job as best as one can. As I started my working life as a school teacher, I very much understand the trials and tribulations of earning a wage and how difficult it is for nearly everyone. When you put in long hours at work and have interaction with the public, there are bound to be some stressful moments. Naturally, it can affect how you perceive your compensation. Typically, and for these very good reasons, most people understand how difficult it is to earn money and to not waste it. The reason why many people turn to the stock market is it has a history of helping people build their wealth over a long period of time. In fact, stock ownership has been the highest returning asset class over extended durations. There is, however, the key point that over a shorter interval, lets call it one year to five years, anything can happen.

As most people learn from the disclaimers, past returns are no guarantee of future success. With that said, the last three months have been tremendously difficult for anyone owning stocks. If one includes what has taken place across the globe, the last year might rank as one of the hardest environments to make money as any one year time frame in the last century. The Great Depression and bursting of the internet bubble were very tough as well, but let's be clear, it has been quite painful to be an owner of a piece of a public company, especially last week. When an asset class loses seven percent of its value in five days or less, that is quite painful. Make no mistake, I am right there with you in terms of understanding the magnitude, severity, and economic pain by owning stocks. However, let's take a step back and refresh our historical memory to provide some further context.

The initial quote from Mr. Munger is a reminder that if you want to own stocks, you have to be prepared to endure the difficult periods. It may not seem like it from the last three months, but as we lengthen the time frame out, three years, five years, ten years and more, a piece of business ownership will reflect the profitability of the business and the ability to grow those profits. Many factors can affect what transpires in a short time frame, as can be seen by what took place during the downturn in 2008. Much of that was related to poor lending decisions in the home mortgage area over the preceding three to five year period. Stocks lost nearly half their value in a year, and had recovered half of the loss in one year, and all of it in the next two years. Mr. Munger lost almost 65% of the value of his investors capital in the 1973-74 time frame, and recovered all of it the following year. He and Buffet subsequently built Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) into the 500 billion dollar enterprise it is today. Historically, some recoveries are quicker than others, for example, the crash in 1987 was recovered in less than nine months. So, as equity owners, if you own good businesses with strong managements, a solid business model, and plenty of cash flow and income, there is a very strong possibility that the recent losses are not permanent. Let's ponder the selloff and some reasons for its cause, and what might be in store for stocks as we look out a few months.

First, all over the globe investors have been losing money in nearly every asset class. Each situation is different, but if an enterprise or individual is borrowing capital to make investments, there is the risk of having to sell holdings to cover liquidity needs. With one week to go in the year, taxes are a factor for every entity, so taking losses to be tax efficient is standard operating procedure for any company in the financial services area. Last week, when the Federal Reserve Chairman raised interest rates by twenty five basis points, he indicated that two more hikes in 2019 were still on the table. Investors hated the way Powell communicated the rate hike at his press conference because there was very little recognition of the weakness in recent earnings reports from large companies. Yesterday, with no budget for 2019 in place, the disagreement over funding for a border wall cemented the reality that certain parts of the federal government will be closed.

The trifecta of a rate hike, messaging dilemma, budget failure, along with Secretary of Defense Mattis resigning, spelled disaster for equities. In sum, anything that could go wrong did, along with some seasonal issues. However, in a week the year will be over, and the tax loss issue goes bye bye. It also wipes the slate clean all over the globe as well. There will probably be some pressure early in 2019 for funds which are getting redemption's from their investors. It will take a month or so to digest that issue as well. As we move deeper into January, earnings reports will start rolling in. The selloff has reduced the hurdle rate for many companies to have operating results that investors will find acceptable enough to not sell off their stock, because, low and behold, that's already happened. So as we get through the first quarter and move into spring, if the economy holds up and doesn't go into recession, which is almost priced in now, a boring but steady market would be the ideal scenario for equities to claw back their lost ground. However, there is that little issue of the ding dong politicians.

Over a long time frame, our inept representatives aren't going to affect how a specific company will perform. They do impact all kinds of matters which affect the market, think trade, taxes, interest rates, budgets, etc. Investors see the progress, or lack thereof, and sell first and ask questions later. Clearly that already took place. With gridlock imminent, the political circus probably isn't going away any time soon. At some point they will solve the budget impasse and the closed parts of the government will reopen. As an individual investor, you can control your actions and mental approach.

Staying healthy, remaining positive, paying attention to the companies you own and how their businesses evolve, and being tax efficient are all constructive steps to having a long term approach that reduces the inclination to run and hide when things are difficult. It is unrealistic to expect anyone to have anywhere near the success of someone like Mr. Munger, but we certainly can learn from his counsel regarding approach and temperament, can't we?"

If we talk about the continuous rise in trends of the market, mushrooming media and the internet research, Humanities is one of the most favorable streams among students in India or in abroad as well. Education is the most important factor for the development of human civilization, not only because it helps a person to give a start to his personality. Professionals and experts working in this field are also high in demand among big Corporates and are also getting high pay scale and respectful place in the job market too.

Students are opting for higher education at a foreign destination enthusiastically, and the number is growing tremendously. Universities internationally offer a variety of degree courses at Under Graduate Level. Good exposure, State-of-Art Infrastructure and world recognition of the degrees earned by these foreign universities give a head start to the career of any student. Have you ever given a thought that why Indian Students prefer to move abroad for higher students in Humanities?

Active learning through various activities like class participation, exchange of dialogues, case studies and practical off and on campus experience through live projects make learning fun and more meaningful. Indian students going abroad for higher studies were restricted to Engineering, Medicine and Law, but with education loans becoming easier to access and many new scholarships opportunities, Indian students are going abroad for undergraduate courses in humanities.

International education provides equal options for all streams, be it Science, Commerce or Humanities. Humanities as a stream are rising among students. Studying humanities in class XI-XIIth allows students to choose from a multitude of courses at graduation level, paving the way for a range of career choices in India or Abroad too. International education provides a holistic environment which helps a student to learn and grow in his/her area of specialization.

A Bachelor degree program in Humanities provides a study of the principles of Economics. Some of the topics and themes common to these programs include fundamentals of global economics, Social and cultural awareness, Political awareness and policies and languages. Upon graduation, students might pursue management careers in business or Government. Relevant certifications are offered through the International Export-Import Institutes. There has been an increase in the number of Indian students enrolling for a degree away from their home country. The major reason behind their choice is the fact that the Indian job market recognizes a degree from an International university more than any degree from an Indian university.

International Education offers a variety of courses to students who want to pursue an undergraduate program. These courses may be offered as a major or minor within humanities. The most popular fields in Humanity are as follows:

* Journalism or Mass Communication for news channels on TV and the internet, advertising agencies and movie studios.

* Content Writing for newspapers, magazines, social media website, marketing for various companies on full-time/part-time basis or as a freelancer

* Civil Services such as IRS/IPS/IAS/IFS officers after cracking civil service exams

* NDA Army Wing after clearing CDS (Combined Defence Services) exam

* Human Resource Manager(HR Manager) in various companies and enterprises

Various Government Sectors

Students who wish to stick to humanities would typically apply for a Bachelor in Arts, Bachelor in Economics or in Psychology and Mass Communication.The world subject rankings table does not offer a separate subject option for humanities and lists entries under Liberal arts, Fine arts and vocational courses is also one of those courses which is coming up really fast. Some of the major destinations for International Education for pursuing bachelors in humanities degree:

Stanford University

When the university was established, the Stanford family said that their aim was to educate ""cultured and useful citizens"" and the university still counts its humanities courses as the ""soul"" of a Stanford education. The School of Humanities and Sciences awards 63 per cent of all Stanford undergraduate degrees and almost 40 per cent of doctorates. Undergraduates are taught by faculty who are pioneers in their field.

Massachusetts Institute

of Technology

Although well known as a leading university in science and technology teaching, the university also provides courses across the arts and humanities. These include anthropology, history, linguistics, literature, media arts and sciences, and music and theatre arts. The School of Architecture and Planning was the first of its kind in the US and is known for commissioning progressive buildings on campus.

University of Oxford

As another of the world's most prestigious institutions, the University of Oxford is hugely respected across all disciplines. The humanities division includes the faculties of music, history, classics and English language and literature, among others. There are about 20,000 students at the university, more than a third of whom are international.

Students belong to a college, where undergraduates take the majority of their classes with just a few of their peers and a college tutor. In line with the British higher education system, students entering Oxford are admitted for a specific course, in contrast to US institutions, where students can take a variety of courses before declaring their major.

University of Cambridge

The University of Cambridge is regularly ranked as a top university across a wide range of subjects. As one of the oldest universities in the world, its colleges and traditions are famous in the UK and beyond. The university is based near London and attracts top scholars and distinguished visitors. More than 18,000 students are enrolled at the university across 31 colleges. The School of Arts and Humanities teaches a variety of subjects, from Asian studies to the history of art.

Harvard University

Harvard is the oldest university in the US and one of the most prestigious in the world. The arts and humanities division offers classes on topics ranging from Celtic myths and Jazz Age novels to Plato and video art. It has the world's largest university library system, consisting of 79 individual libraries containing more than 18 million volumes.

Admission to any college abroad is through SAT for most of the undergraduate courses.

Scientists at the School of Economics at the National Research University of Russia claim to have succeeded in creating an algorithm that would help neural networks to identify individuals through the content of their galleries.

Neural networks are computer models capable of performing machine learning as well as pattern recognition, inspired by an animal's central nervous system and have several practical applications, such as helping virtual assistants to sound more human.

Without the presence of technology, the gender of a person is correctly identified in 90% of cases, and in the age issue, the process is much more uncertain. In the classification, there is no age-specific, but age groups and, analyzing each individual frame, the network concludes with percentage probabilities for each group.

Russian researchers, led by Professor Andrey Savchenko, have implemented a feature in the new algorithm that would aggregate percentages of age brackets into statistics and the Dempster-Shafer theory. The theory of evidence allows us to combine evidence from a variety of sources and reach a degree of credibility that takes into account all available evidence. That is, it would turn the percentages into statistics and use all the elements to reach the conclusion of the age of the person in question.

The method does not only include one neural network, but several, for each factor to be defined; one for age, one for gender, and so on. But when combined, they not only define the factors individually but also assign a unique vector to each person who passes through the process.

The algorithm has arrived in a new phase of tests and has already begun to be applied in some applications for Android. Unlike some existing systems, such as Instagram, it works even without an internet connection, processing the contents of the gallery to perform the data collection; analyzing and collecting information from intimate circles, close friends, family members, and initiating and conducting the process of assigning the unique vector to all circle members.

The new algorithm can and should be used for smartphone manufacturers to create new recommendation systems with greater ease and accuracy. If, for example, a user has too much content in his gallery with a child, as would tend to notify him of products related to toy stores and games.

Savchenko warns that system servers do not have access to user photos and videos, only to reports generated by the algorithm, meaning that they will not share data, as is common in recent news. The information that would be acquired depends on the user. It may be that the main circle of the user has 3 women and 2 men, or that he frequents a lot of fast food networks, etc.

The interest in technology is wide, with one of the largest smartphone manufacturers already eyeing the development and use of the algorithm. And although it does not name companies, it is very likely that the Samsung, Huawei or Apple giants will use the system on their handsets in the coming years."

Nettapakkam police station in Puducherry was ranked the fourth best police station in the country.

Union home minister Rajnath Singh announced the list of the top 10 police stations in the country during the inaugural function of DGPs and IGPs conference in Gujarat on Friday.

The Union government selected the top 10 stations based on a report prepared by the Intelligence Bureau (IB). The IB gathered information from all stations in the country to select the top 10 performing stations.

Chief minister V Narayanasamy while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the National Law Day celebrations on Thursday night in Puducherry said it was the first time a police station in Union territory bagged the national honours.

Puducherry DGP S Sundari Nanda will receive the trophy from Union home minister, he said.

""The credit must go to the Puducherry police officials. The trophy is the recognition of the hard work of Puducherry police force,"" he said.

Narayanasamy pointed out that in September this year, for the first time in the history of Puducherry, seven government and private schools in the Union territory were selected for national awards for cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene.

""A government school in Kunichampet was ranked first in cleanliness, sanitation and hygiene in the country. Seven schools in Puducherry and Karaikal were among the 52 schools shortlisted for the national awards,"" he pointed out"
"85","1024173050","2018-12-21","http://mydigitalfc.com/fc-weekend/science-cooking","Science of cooking","mydigitalfc.com",FALSE,"You may call it food science or a fad. But molecular gastronomy is the in-thing in the world of fine dine culinary.

As they say, there are many branches of food science that study different aspects of food: safety, microbiology, preservation, chemistry, engineering and physics. Till molecular gastronomy came along, there was no branch dedicated to studying the chemical processes of cooking at home and in restaurants although it all existed in some form or other.

Food science has primarily been concerned with industrial food production and, while the disciplines may overlap, they are considered separate areas of investigation.

The creation of molecular gastronomy was intended to bring together what had previously been fragmented and isolated investigations into the chemical and physical processes of cooking into an organised discipline within food science, to address what the other disciplines within food science either do not cover, or cover in a manner intended for scientists rather than cooks, claim experts.

The term ""molecular and physical gastronomy"" was coined way back in 1988 by Hungarian physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Hervé This. In 1992, it became the title for a set of workshops held in Italy's Erice, where scientists and professional cooks came together for a discussion on the science behind traditional cooking preparations. Eventually, the term ""molecular gastronomy"" became the name of the approach, based on exploring the science behind traditional cooking methods.

According to Sous Chef Vikram Bisht at Taj Gateway Resort, Damdama, molecular gastronomy is a science-based concept of cooking. According to the technical term, it is an art of cooking that involves a combination of physics and chemistry. Nowadays, a lot of hotels, institutes and restaurants in India are exploring it.

Demand

The demand has started picking up slowly, he says. While its popularity hasn't shown the highest momentum, chefs today have started to incorporate these techniques into their cooking and experiment with ingredients. Moreover, curating food is interesting as minute details are covered as one resorts to a scientific way of cooking food, says Bisht, adding: ""At Taj Damdama, our complimentary gastronomy cooking has been a great delight. Dishes like veg caviar that cannot be made with non-veg items, have been experimented with molecular gastronomy.""

The fact that eminent restaurateur Zorawar Kalra has upended all notions of traditional Indian cuisine is nothing new. One can credit him with introducing foams, spheres, gels and liquid nitrogen -- all hallmarks of molecular gastronomy.

Of late, he has been dabbling with all things connected with molecular techniques, yet go much beyond it. It's a combination of culinary methods some of which are ancient and others are way ahead of their time. For instance, the pickling of karela that takes 15 to 20 days, is evocative of cooking methods of yore, while the lip-smacking chocolate dessert is done by supercharging a magnet and having it quantum-locked in space.

""It is pure gastronomy now,"" says Kalra. ""We have gone past molecular gastronomy some 4-5 years ago. There are new technologies that have come in along with old conserving methods like fermenting food through pickling etc. These days we use homogenisers for cocktails so that food safety is protected and nothing is touched,"" Kalra explains.

For him the millennials are the major customers who eat out four-to-five times a week. The Indian market is about to grow at 20 per cent. ""It is already seeing an 18 per cent growth,"" he says.

His company, Massive Restaurants, clocked an FY18 revenue of Rs 220 crore, a 30 per cent growth over the previous year.

'Molecular Magician' and top Chef Bakshish Dean who has been studying this subject since 2002, says he was lucky to have had very supportive bosses who gave him all the liberty to experiment and put out dishes on the menu which had been enhanced using this wonderful science.

The top chef of the country who has been awarded the title of 'Molecular Magician,' is a maverick in the world of gastronomy. He is the man behind 'Johny Rockets' coming to India and he is also 'the man' behind the conceptual Cha-Bar in Delhi.

While people like Chef Bakshish and Chef Abhijit Saha have been the pioneers in the field in India, the concept got mass recognition only recently.

Innovative

According to Chef Bisht, chefs these days are thinking innovatively and re-visiting everything that did not make sense in the kitchen earlier. The availability of niche ingredients in India that help curate meals are much more innovative and keep up with global trends. ""The interest in science, the precedence given to it and the desire to question culinary art has now been more than ever,"" he says.

For Chef Mohib Farooqui, associate director, Culinary Arts at Indian School of Hospitality, anything and everything from boiling an egg is molecular gastronomy because it's the chemical and physical reaction that has led to the whole process. He too claims to be among the fortunate few to have started working in the area as early as 2005 when he was in Australia.

""In India it all got promoted in 2009 by pioneers like Chef Abhijit Saha in Bangalore and Chef Bakshish Dean in Delhi,"" he recalls.

It's a fussy thing, he says, adding how everybody those days was involved in spherification.

Spherification is kitchen alchemy, a technique that enables you to imbue a flavourful liquid with the appearance of being solid, an illusion that's broken when the spheres burst with flavour as they're eaten.

The idea of exploiting spherification-like techniques for food production was first patented in Britain in 1942 by William Peschardt, a food scientist working for the firm Unilever. Since then, the technique -- using ions to trigger a gelling process -- has found a variety of uses in the food industry.

It was Sergi Estragues and Joachim Vives, representatives of a Spanish food company, who initially demonstrated the technique to Ferran Adrià. He put it to far more creative and surprising uses at his restaurant - elBulli - one of the pioneers of molecular gastronomy those days.

'It's abolished completely today as it's a cliché thing and chefs are moving away from it,"" says Farooqui.

The term ""molecular gastronomy"" has often been misused. Everyone thinks some sublimation of smoke or dry ice is molecular gastronomy. That's not true, he argues.

Food technology has been using all these for a long time. Today, says Farooqui, anything new would be termed as molecular but in fact a more apt term would be to call it modernist cuisine.

Even making mayonese requires a modernist procedure.

While the concept of molecular gastronomy is exciting and revolutionary in the world of culinary art, there are complex challenges that embrace this discipline as far as India is concerned.

Most of the ingredients used are imported, and very expensive be it Agar-Agar or China Grass as texture modifier. Agar-Agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from red algae. Often used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work, Agar-Agar can also be used as a laxative, an appetite suppressant, a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice-cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics.

""These ingredients are difficult to procure and there is only one Mumbai-based company, Chenab Impex, that is importing products from Spain. Procurement is expensive,"" argues Farooqui.

Moreover, he says, homegenisers are beyond Rs10 lakh, which means restaurants have to spend that much and also get return on investment, which is difficult.""

Kalra points out how equipment is a big challenge. ""There are just five homogenisers in the whole of UK. You can well imagine the situation,"" he adds.

As Bisht puts it, the constraints around time, space, money will continue to persist, unless there is adequate investment in these areas. ""Also, one of the main troubles is that this methodology in cooking does not facilitate all kinds of dishes,"" he complains.

Chef Dean recalls, ""It definitely has proliferated from the time I started understanding and learning the subject but not to the extent that I would have loved to witness. I see a lot of young chefs and bar experts wanting to learn the subject but unfortunately because of the lack of subject experts they are grappling with it, so the learning curve is way too long. There is no school or institute that has taken the mantle of making this wonderful subject available to students and professionals from the trade. It's a wonderful subject that will lead to advancement in cuisine but is in a pretty sad state.""

Executive Chef Rajani Ranjan Rashmi of Sahara Star points out that liquid nitrogen is banned by FSSAI and hence despite a craze for gastronomy many people are going back to ancient techniques.

""Dry ice is not safe either. Molecular gastronomy may provide visual appeal with jalebi caviars etc but the major challenge is that most ingredients are not readily available. These have to be imported. Also there's little education on the subject in cooking schools,"" he says.

Acceptance

As for demand it is often created with acceptance and embracing the idea. ""Acceptability in India is slow due to lack of understanding. Otherwise it can push our cuisine towards pathbreaking development and once on that track, I do see a lot of demand,"" Chef Dean adds, saying, ""Little knowledge, they say, is dangerous but having no knowledge is like pushing yourself into reverse gear at a time when everyone is moving ahead. I sincerely hope we realise this soon and encourage our next generation to learn, master the subject and move forward.""

The future is a raging debate. This will stand or fall with its capability to exhibit whether it is a scientific discipline of relevance or just a sub-study under food science, say experts.

The merit of molecular gastronomy will be proven after it receives enough interest from the general public, says Bisht.

The world over, the concept is very successful as it is viewed as a development like in any other field and the subject is studied as a science and not discarded as a fashion, explains Chef Dean, adding, ""It empowers us to get deeper into the subject and take control of what we can do with food, islolate flavours, create textures, understand nutrition, enhance how we present and grow food. It empowers us to create diets which can assist in curing disease, look at alternates that one would never ever have considered, revive lost foods and much more.""

Food gastronomy is connected with food beverages and their genesis. Experimental cooking is an evolving style and this can be continually built upon by building on the knowledge base in kitchen studies.

""Our training institutes ensure progressive cooking is taught to our employees in the kitchen and we strive to bring in excellence and ideas together. Our guests love what we learn and plate up. We hope that as much as this concept is creating the buzz, we are able to sustain it over the years to come. Considering the immense scope around creating dishes that have flavour and meaning, this concept, if made to bloom, can be instrumental in creating stellar recipes in the kitchen,"" adds Chef Bisht."

The book that I most enjoyed buying, reading and re-reading this year is Living With The Gods by Neil MacGregor, who very famously gave us A History of the World in 100 Objects.

Based on the 30 part BBC radio series, which I haven't listened to, I was very lucky to have caught the exhibition itself at the British Museum earlier this year. Beginning with the 40,000 year old Lion Man sculpture to fascinating art and artefacts, the book weaves the incredible story of our existence through not just practise but also our individual understanding of faith. The convergence of many of the beliefs, the reasons why communities often choose to ignore them, and wear the differences as a badge will make us think hard about the need and purpose of religion.

Very early in the introduction MacGregor spells it out quite simply - 'that in deciding how we live with our Gods, we also decide how we live with each other'.

Illuminating, thought provoking and quite simply, staggering in its scope, Living With The Gods will remain one of the most important works (across its many formats) including as a print book.

I had loved Michael Ondaatje's Cats Table, a small, retro little gem, and his new novel Warlight is a deeper, more beautiful and haunting version of it. It returns to the writer's old terrain, WW2, this time telling the story of two siblings in post-blitz London left to their own devices by a mysterious and glamorous mother and looked after by a host of colourful characters.

And, of course, because this is Ondaatje there is tragedy and bloodshed and deep love at the centre of it -- in particular about a mother and her children. Maybe because I have a two-year-old and am immersed in motherhood, maybe because it seems to me Ondaatje has returned to real form with the last two books, this moved me and stayed with me this year like nothing else.

VK KARTHIKA, PUBLISHER, WESTLAND

Sometimes you hear a writer talking about an idea and you know instantly that it's for you -- as editor, publisher, reader, citizen. One is so bombarded by big talk these days, and breaking stories, that to find a non-fiction narrative that explores interiorities within the context of the big political picture is unusual in itself. In The Anatomy of Hate, investigative reporter Revati Laul tracks the lives of her characters -- ordinary men and women caught in an extraordinary time -- through transformative moments in their lives over a decade-and-a-half. Gradually, she paints a canvas for us, of the way hate and violence play out among neighbours and strangers, of relationships built and damaged, of caste and class, tradition and rebellion, as they intersect and culminate in specific individual actions.

And yet, all of this sits lightly on the page. On the surface, it's pacy and anecdotal -- and shocking, given the subject. It's only as you get deeper into the narrative that you realise how every sentence has been born of years of research and reading, and hours of interviews, beginning in 2002, the year that changed something fundamental in India. This is a book that demands nuance and engagement from the reader, and I would recommend it without hesitation.

MERU GOKHALE, PUBLISHER, THE PENGUIN PRESS GROUP

The best book I read this year - which we didn't publish - was Red Birds by Mohammed Hanif. With Hanif, the thing that draws me in, always, is how he never paints an underdog; even his victims are fighters and survivors. This is richly rewarding for the reader; we are often so buried under misery narratives (not that there's anything wrong with portraying the bleak perspective!) that the dauntless righteousness and the survival instincts of Hanif's characters are, quite apart from being tremendously entertaining, very gratifying indeed. For me, the novel felt like a reminder that we're all in this together, and we all had better count on each other if we are meant to survive the times we've found ourselves in.

I would also like to mention another extraordinary book: What We Talk About When We Talk About Rape by Sohaila Abdulali, which we did publish, and which I think will always be urgent, necessary, valuable and game-changing. This too is a book about survivors, and absolutely no one in the world could have written the book that Abdulali wrote.

NIRMAL KANTI BHATTACHARJEE, DIRECTOR, NIYOGI BOOKS

The two books that I really enjoyed reading this year are The Epic City by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury Circus) and Great Textpectations by Ruchi Vadehra (Rupa). The Epic City portrays the world on the streets of Calcutta. The book is a fascinating read not only for those who have lived in Calcutta, but also for those who have only heard about the mystery surrounding the city. Having lived the better part of his youth in the USA, the author decided to return home and take up journalism as a profession in Calcutta. Obviously, he loves the city of his birth and his observations are honest and insightful. Interspersed with a lot of humour and sunny sarcasm, the book is his soulful, compelling and often hilarious account of life in a city that often looks like it lives in its own time zone. After Suketu Mehta's classic Maximum City on Mumbai, Epic City is the best city-centric book that I have read so far.

Ruchi Vadehra's debut novel, Great Textpectations, seems to suggest that 'text is the new talk'. Though a breezy read, it is not a mushy love story. The author breaks new ground by highlighting the fun text conversation between two young persons, which becomes instrumental in connecting their worlds. Amaya is a Delhi-based intellectually inclined 35 year old single woman who is financially independent and sexually liberated. She wants to open a boutique bookstore and live life on her own terms. While playing Scrabble online, she comes across Rohan and they soon get chatting. The actual texts the author weaves into the narrative are realistic, while also being highly original in their tone and tenor. When Amaya's boutique bookstore, to which Rohan has supplied a lot of concepts, is to be inaugurated, they decide to meet. Rohan goes to Delhi from Mumbai and the apprehension of a face-to-face meeting with all its concomitant baggage vanishes and their ideas resonate well with each other. We close the book with a satisfied chuckle as it ends with hints of a happily-ever-after.

POULOMI CHATTERJEE, EDITOR IN CHIEF AND PUBLISHER, HACHETTE

One of the best books I've read this year is The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry. I came to it later than I should have (it was published in 2017) - the perils of being in the business of books! - but it came highly recommended (and beautifully packaged), and I waited for the right stretch of time so I could read it at one go. And I'm so glad I did! After a long time I think I found a book that had me completely immersed in it.

The story is set in Victorian England; the recently widowed (read liberated) Cora travels away from London to recuperate at Essex, where she hears of a monster water serpent that is said to be haunting the area. The eerie, gothic setting and tone, the overwhelming 'presence' of the mythic monster that leaves you guessing, the turns the plot takes - it is just a fabulous example of old-fashioned storytelling, the stuff that the best books are made of. It also has a tremendously layered narrative - you have the play-off between faith and science (as Cora goes hunting for fossils - and the serpent - she meets the rector of Aldwinter, who does not quite (or is it wish to) believe the creature exists); reality and the imagination; the expectations of men and desires of women.

And through all this what really kept me reading is the exquisite use of language. The descriptions of the marshes especially, the moss and fungus and bugs and mud, and the waters that seem to hide in them a constant menace. Not to mention the dialogues and exchanges between the characters, be it debate or banter or snarky disdain or confessions of vulnerability. I could go on and on, but yes, this is a book I will come back to again and again. I've recommended it and gifted it a dozen times over, and will continue to do so for some time to come.

PRASUN CHATTERJEE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, PAN MACMILLAN PUBLISHING INDIA

In 2018, I have been inspired by the idea of travel and read through Stewart Gordon's book on great routes of human history. His There and Back (Oxford University Press 2018) is one of the memorable books I read this year. Also, my interest in the reasons for the rise of Hitler and his appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 led me to read about the failure of Social Democrats in Germany and I picked up The Letters of Rosa Luxemburg (Verso, 2011).

In February, we published what is perhaps our most important and yet endearing book, The RTI Story: Power to the People by Aruna Roy and the MKSS Collective. The book charts the journey of the movement, from a call to action to legislation and how, along the way, ordinary citizens joined to relentlessly fight for transparency in governance. It is an extremely readable book, full of anecdotes and in the inimitable deferential style of Aruna Roy it gives credit to no one person, or organisation but to the thousands who rallied around the movement to empower people through the Right to Information. I particularly enjoyed reading about the remarkable RTI soldiers such as Norti Bai who dropped out of school at age 10 but went on to be computer literate, a sarpanch of her panchayat and teach girls computer studies, or Sushila who was a Class 4 pass who coined the slogan Hamara Paisa, Hamara Hisaab! When asked by journalists why she was fighting for the RTI she answered, ""When I send my son to the bazaar with Rs10 ask him for an account of what he spent; why should I not ask the government to be accountable when they spend crores in my name?""

With the RTI Act under threat there has never been a better time to read this book. A line from the introduction sums up best why I recommend this as the book of the year. ""This collective history empowers young readers to understand their capabilities and possible roles in shaping governance."" In these dim times, read this ""story of the success of Indian democracy"" to, perhaps, feel a sense of hope again.

If I could be indulgent and include another book! My Paper Chase by Harold Evans. I stumbled across this book this summer even though it was published nearly 10 years ago. What a charming, engrossing read by one of journalism's finest. Evans is a natural storyteller and his account of growing up in middle class Britain and being amongst the first editors from a background other than the typical public school-Oxbridge pool, made the book all the more engaging. Its pace and energy is matched with the stories he recounts of his time as editor of the prestigious Sunday Times - from the murder of his correspondent David Holden and the investigation into his death, to the Philby exposure, and the scoops by the Insight team... A brilliant read.

RAVI SINGH, PUBLISHER, SPEAKING TIGER BOOKS

One of the best books I've read this year, and which I wish we'd published, is Neelum Saran Gour's Requiem in Raga Janki, based on the life of the Hindustani singer and tawaif Janki Bai Allahabadi (1880-1934), a contemporary of Gauhar Jaan and just as famous. Neelum is an extraordinary writer of fiction who deserves far greater recognition than she has received, and this is perhaps her finest novel. Janki's life is the stuff of legend, full of glory and tragedy -- born to a wayward wrestler and a woman who was later sold into prostitution, she survived an attack in which she was stabbed fifty-six times (after which incident she was nicknamed 'chhappan chhuri').

Trained in Hindustani music by the biggest ustads, she eventually gained great fame as a singer, being invited to perform at mehfils and royal durbars across India, and becoming the first artist recorded by HMV. She amassed great wealth, loved freely and lost much, and converted to Islam -- but in the best traditions of Hindustani music, continued to find beauty and solace in Islam and Hinduism as in secular and sensual experiences forbidden in both religions. It couldn't have been an easy task to strike the right balance between credible storytelling and the melodrama necessary for a full telling of such a life, but Neelum pulls it off. The prose is brilliant, even if not all her experiments with language are successful.

It's a capacious novel, gloriously rich in period detail and rare histories. But its real triumph is the feisty narrator, a 90-year-old who may well have been a tawaif herself, a survivor and a bit of a subversive. The perfect voice to tell the story of a woman who pursued art, love, fame and wealth with equal passion."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

The story that emerges from Arvind Lal's book is undoubtedly fascinating. It begins with a terrible tragedy of Arvind's only brother, younger than him, who, in a state of drunkenness, shot dead his father, a pre-World War II commissioned Army doctor, who after opting for premature retirement in 1947, was successfully running a pathology laboratory. Arvind's mother and he dealt with the shattering shock and its aftermath, thanks to her courage and support of their family's spiritual mentor, a very young and devout saint known as Haidakhan Baba.

A student of Delhi's Modern School, Arvind's ambition of becoming a naval aviator was put paid to owing to weak eyesight and on the advice of his uncle, a naval officer, he chose medicine and joined the Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC), Pune, where after MBBS, he was back for post-graduation and also assigned as a teacher and hostel warden, the only ever civilian to hold that post. While medical college hostels are known for their lack of dull moments, some anecdotes of incidents in the AFMC hostel related in the book only prove how adventurous and at times quite over-adventurous the students are.

Following the ordeal of his father's death and its aftermath, Arvind's mother and he got set to face the future. Arvind had to leave the enviable triple involvement at AFMC to take over, his father's legacy of a path lab.

Maj. Dr S.K. Lal began his career as an Army doctor in the Indian Medical Service, later re-named Royal Indian Army Medical Corps and belonged to a genre of Indian Army doctors who saved many a soldier's life in very challenging conditions of a bloody World War II, in which 250,000 Indian Armed Forces formed a highly war-winning component of the Allies. After partition, Maj. Lal, a pathologist by profession, came to partitioned India from Rawalpindi, which became part of Pakistan and having left the Army, set up a lab in Delhi as the Central Clinical Laboratory in 1949, with about 30 patients visiting it everyday.

After taking over his father's lab, Dr Arvind Lal changed its name to Dr Lal PathLabs and not much later, launched new testing methods and introduced more tests. Reacting to the first technological challenge, Arvind added an auto analyser after it was launched in 1982 and the first testing for hormones in India in a private lab was done by Dr. Lal Pathlabs in 1981. Before that no thyroid test could be done in a private lab. That thought led him to create collection centres in different parts of the city. From there on, a patient could visit a centre close to his house, give his blood sample, go back to his house eat his breakfast and again in two hours come back and collect his reports. And this is how Arvind introduced franchising -- probably for the first time in healthcare in the world.

Since 1980, Dr Lal PathLabs is following the same kind of franchise agreement. Today, more than 95 per cent of the collection centres are franchised. With this, Dr Arvind Lal solved one of the greatest problems in healthcare -- that of accessibility. Presently, Dr Lal PathLabs conducts about 700 home visits everyday, operating nearly 200 labs, including Asia's biggest lab at Rohini, New Delhi with 2,100 collection centres and pick-up samples from another 5,000 medical establishments all over India. The lab tests over 70,000 patients everyday and its record till 2017, has been of having tested over 15.5 million patients.

Arvind and his family maintained their close contact with Haidakhan Baba and no matter what agnostics or cynics is think or say, there is power in spiritual devotion, meditation and linked issues related to the Hindu religion or civilisation, which the Western world does not understand but has done enough damage to.

Dr Lal PathLabs (LPL) has become one of the most reputed laboratories in Asia, having to its credit a record of 28 labs accredited from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL, Ministry of Science and Technology, Govt. of India). It has achieved international recognition for the Indian healthcare industry in the form of accreditation from the College of American Pathologists (CAP -- USA).

Dr. Lal has revolutionised laboratory medicine by introducing the maximum number of new tests, instruments and ICT (Information, Communications, Technology) systems in India. His R&D unit has done India proud by developing the latest tests in molecular diagnostics, cytogenetics, genetics and many more. The aim of the R&D division is to provide highly specialised tests at low cost to the weaker sections of the society.

Arvind is a member of many expert and advisory bodies constituted by the central and the state governments. He is accredited to having the first PPP (Public Private Partnership) in the field of laboratory testing with the government of Tripura since 2004 and later with the government of Gujarat for testing over 30,000 newborn babies in 2011-2012. In 2017, NITI Aayog appointed him as the convenor of the Working Group on Diagnostics that submitted a model PPP to the Aayog that will form the template for future PPPs in diagnostics with the Central & state governments.

He is currently the chairman of the Health Services Committee, FICCI. Dr Lal is also an active member of NATHEALTH, Healthcare Federation of India, National Healthcare Committee of CII and has played a significant role in promoting the Indian healthcare sector abroad. He is also leading the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) Curriculum Development Committee for paramedical training in the field of laboratory medicine.

Appointed as the honorary physician to the President of India in 2001, Dr Lal has also been serving as a pathologist to almost all the past and present Presidents and Prime Ministers of India. His laboratory is the nodal laboratory testing the largest number of government employees in India from CGHS, ECHS, the Ministry of Railways, Delhi government and many others. He has been invited as the keynote speaker at IIM-Ahmedabad and also by the Harvard Business School, USA. In 2016, IIM-Ahmedabad published a case study on Dr Lal PathLabs as a part of their teaching curriculum.

Awarded with the Padma Shri, Dr Lal is also the first civilian doctor to be granted an honorary brigadier's rank in the Armed Forces Medical Services.

In 2015, under his leadership, his company had one of the most successful IPOs' in recent history of the National Stock Exchange. In 2016, the All India Management Association (AIMA) conferred on Dr Lal the ""Entrepreneur of the Year"" award. In 2017, Dr Lal was conferred with the ""Lifetime Achievement Award"" by the Federation of Indian Chambers and Commerce (FICCI).

Apart from all the achievements mentioned, the book, with many enjoyable anecdotes, makes for a delightful read."

In a report published in Nature, however, scientists at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute say they have shown that a personalized 'neoantigen' vaccine can spur a response against glioblastoma, with immune T-cells generated by the vaccine migrating into the brain tumor, creating a 'hotter,' inflamed environment around the cancer cells. The neoantigen vaccine approach has been pioneered in the laboratory of Catherine Wu, MD, at Dana-Farber.

""This is the first time it has been shown that a vaccine can generate immune cells against the tumor that can traffic from the bloodstream into a glioblastoma tumor,"" said David Reardon, MD, senior author of the study. Reardon is clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at Dana-Farber.

A hallmark of cancer is the presence of DNA mutations that alter the growth properties of cancer cells. The personalized vaccine used in the Nature study takes advantage of the fact that some of these mutations cause cancer cells to display peptide molecules called neoantigens on their surface. Because these neoantigens aren't present on the surface of normal cells, they are ideal targets for recognition and attack by the immune system. Cancers whose cells contain a higher number of neoantigens tend to be more responsive to immunotherapy. Glioblastoma is a 'cold' tumor because it has a relatively low burden of mutations and, correspondingly, fewer neoantigens.

This phase 1/1b trial was designed to assess feasibility and safety of the vaccine approach. The vaccine was extremely safe with no significant side effects. To create the vaccine for an individual patient, tumor tissue removed during initial surgery underwent DNA analysis and comparison with normal DNA from the patient to identify neoantigens expressed by the tumor cells. Small proteins (peptides) from the neoantigens were synthesized in a laboratory and formed the basis of the vaccine. When given to the patient, the neoantigens in the vaccine 'train' the immune system to detect and attack the glioblastoma tumor cells.

Co-authors from the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital extracted tumor tissue from which the personalized vaccines were developed.

""This personalized approach to creating a vaccine that can reinvigorate a patient's immune system represents the culmination of a collaboration between experts in neurosurgery and neuro-oncology,"" said co-author Antonio Chiocca, MD, chair of the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women's. ""We're thrilled to have played a role in this innovative work.""

Ten patients were enrolled in the reported vaccine study. One patient was withdrawn because of too few neoantigens present in their tumor and another had disease that progressed rapidly before the vaccine was formulated. The vaccines created for the remaining eight patients contained between seven and 20 neoantigen peptides. Although all eight patients vaccinated on the study died from progressive tumor, their survival was longer than typically observed for GBM patients.

Of the eight patients who received the vaccine, a robust T-cell response was observed against multiple vaccinated neoantigens in the two patients who did not receive dexamethasone when the vaccine was administered. Dexamethasone is a strong anti-inflammatory steroid medication that is routinely given to brain cancer patients due to brain swelling caused by the tumor. The other patients, who all received dexamethasone during their vaccination, did not respond.

""Based on the two patients that did exhibit a response the results showed that a personalized neoantigen vaccine can activate immune cells in the bloodstream and, moreover, these cells can migrate to the site of the tumor,"" said the lead author, Derin Keskin, PhD. This was shown by using a novel approach to molecularly track T-cells with specific reactivity against the immunizing neoantigens - an approach designed by the team at the Dana-Farber Translational Immunogenomics Laboratory, co-led by Keskin, Ken Livak, PhD, and Sachet Shukla, PhD. Reardon said, ""These results provide proof of principle that the personalized vaccine is one strategy for converting an immunologically cold tumor into an inflamed tumor.""

""Having demonstrated that the vaccine can stimulate an immune response in glioblastoma,"" said Reardon, ""the next step is to add an immunotherapy drug called a checkpoint inhibitor, aimed at freeing the immune response from molecular 'brakes' so that the T-cells can react more strongly against the tumor."" The neoantigen vaccine coupled with the checkpoint inhibitor are expected to be synergistic, leading to a stronger anti-tumor immune response. Furthermore, glioblastoma patients will receive Avastin instead of steroids to treat brain swelling.

Director Balaji Tharaneetharan's second release after the hilarious Naduvula Konjam Pakkatha Kaanom is a satirical take on the Tamil film industry. And those of us who've cringed in our seats for many unbelievably bad star vehicles, and wondered if the director's sole intention was to slow torture us to death, would completely get what Balaji wants to say through Seethakaathi.

When we first see Aadhimoolam Ayya, the character played by Vijay Sethupathi, he's a child in a Lava-Kusa play in the 1940s. Then we see him as a youth dressed as Kannagi, then Satyavan. He plays an angry old man taking on the government, before turning into a truculent Aurangzeb in the new millennium. All of this happens onstage and the dialogues are in literary Tamil. This isn't a conventional hero introduction and it is a big risk to take, considering mainstream films are supposed to begin with a bang, let alone this s-l-o-w opening.

But then, Seethakaathi is a protest against such mainstream films, so it's only befitting that the film does away with such a beginning. As a theatre artiste, Aadhimoolam is witness to the dwindling interest in the art form. From a time when the hall was full of people applauding him, now there are only a few half-heartedly responding to his pathos-laden monologues. Vijay Sethupathi usually speaks like Vijay Sethupathi in all his films - irrespective of the character he plays - and though this never gets boring, his dialogue delivery in these portions of Seethakaathi is a pleasant surprise.

It was revealed a few days before the release that Vijay Sethupathi is present for less than an hour in the film. This is true, but his absence is what structures the film. Perhaps Balaji was inspired by all the interviews given by ""humble"" actors who claim that it is all ""iraivan arul"" that they're able to act like this? Without giving away too much, Seethakathi sets up a unique premise that promises a rollicking ride - what if anyone could become a superstar (the intermission, by the way, is announced through the SUPERSTAR font), thanks to a supernatural phenomenon? Hint: The title comes from a Tamil proverb you should look up if you are curious and don't mind spoilers.

It also offers one a ringside view of what happens behind the scenes, on the sets of a film - and the difference between a good actor and a bad one. Anyone who has watched Balaji's first film would know that he's a genius when it comes to humour through repetition. If people in Naduvula had to repeat the same things over and over again because of the lead character who has short term memory loss, in Seethakaathi, it happens because the actor in question is completely clueless about what to do.

As you watch Sundar (Bagavathi Perumal) struggling to get his hero Saravanan (Rajkumar) to just turn casually and give a reaction when he sees his crush from school days (which Vijay Sethupathi did so admirably in 96 recently), you feel like you must unleash the milk of human compassion within you every time you write a review. You are tempted to award every film that hits the screens a generous five stars, in recognition of the blood tears that the director must have shed to get the film to the screen, never mind the hero's bad wig and the heroine's blank face.

However, though these potshots keep coming (there's another hilarious sequence with Sunil, who plays a producer turned wannabe star), the film doesn't quite come together. Perhaps it's because we know so little of Aadhimoolam Ayya. Other than the fact that he loves acting and his grandson, there's nothing much we know of him. Govind Vasantha's beautiful music helps create the atmosphere for these scenes, but one wishes that Balaji had given us more about Ayya to hold on to and understand. The threads he gives us are too few for us to knit together a clearer image.

And we know even lesser about Ayya's family, the people who drive his actions. Archana, who plays his wife, for instance, barely speaks and wears a pained expression that looks copy-pasted from frame to frame. Ditto for the daughter.

For that matter, none of the women characters in the film speaks much, including Gayathrie, Parvathi Nair and Remya Nambessaan, who make cameo appearances. The TV panelists, the members of the public who are interviewed, the crew on the film sets, the producers, the judge (a superb J Mahendran) and the lawyers - all of them are male. The only women who speak to some length are the stage actors in two instances, but then, they're playing roles, not speaking as themselves. If Seethakaathi intended to land punches on mainstream cinema, it's quite disappointing that the director has followed the same format when it comes to the treatment of women's roles.

You keep waiting for the film to take the wackiness of its central idea further but that never happens. Considering its lengthy runtime of close to 3 hours (is that in defiance of new age cinema too?), Seethakaathi could have done much more with its fun premise. The questions it wishes to raise are important ones - can art ever be business? If art must pay, then must its quality be compromised? Or can we do away with art entirely, like the arrogant Arungzeb, whom Aadhimoolam once famously played? The answers that the film offers, however, are too black and white, too easily divided into good and bad. For a satire, Seethakaathi stops well short of drawing blood and is content to merely open its jaws in the threat that it will - and that makes it a good comedy which is several notches below greatness.

By ""real,"" she does not mean more difficult. Rather, the activist and author is seeking recognition of the value of domestic work, and to raise its status and pay accordingly. ""It's the work that makes all other work possible,"" said Poo, executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance (NDWA) and author of the best-selling book ""The Age of Dignity: Preparing for the Elder Boom in a Changing America.""

""Caregiving is the work that allows the rest of us to go out and do our work in the world, but it has been made invisible and taken for granted,"" she said. ""It's not called real work - it's unskilled, 'help' paying poverty wages.""

Poo has been active since the mid-1990s in the movement to organize caregivers, nannies and other domestic workers to fight for equal rights and better wages. Along with leading the New York City-based NDWA, she co-directs Caring Across Generations, which focuses mainly on policy at the state and local level. Poo's work was recognized by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, which awarded her one of its ""genius grants"" in 2014.

NDWA has 63 local affiliates and chapters around the country, and organizes nearly 200,000 workers. In 2013, the organization played a key role in getting the U.S. Department of Labor to rewrite rules to include domestic workers in the federal government's minimum wage and hours protections. The organization also has helped win passage of legislation in eight states that extends basic protections such as overtime rules, paid sick days and the right to unionize to domestic workers.

In 2019, NDWA will be pushing legislation at the federal and state levels aimed at lifting up this crucial work.

U.S. lawmakers will introduce legislation in Congress next year that would close legal loopholes excluding domestic workers from some federal labor and civil rights laws, create new benefits and protections for them, and encourage innovations to address the unique challenges of domestic work. The legislation, called the Domestic Workers Bill of Rights, is sponsored by U.S. Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Pramila Jayapal, both Democrats.

The legislative push has important implications not only for the well-being of caregivers, but for the labor market and economy as the country ages.

By the year 2030 there will be a severe national shortage of caregivers, according to recent research by human resources expert Paul Osterman. We will be short 151,000 paid direct-care workers, and 3.8 million unpaid family caregivers. Osterman, a professor of human resources and management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, projects that by 2040 the shortfall will rise to 355,000 paid workers and a shocking 11 million ""family and friends"" or unpaid family caregivers. (https://reut.rs/2Evm8yj)

CREATING QUALITY JOBS

Lifting up domestic work, including caregiving, can make this work more desirable, Poo thinks, and attract many new workers to the field.

Currently, most domestic workers still earn only $11 an hour or less, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and most do not receive healthcare or retirement benefits. ""With the need for family care growing - both child care and elder care, but especially elder care - we will need a strong, professional workforce to meet the need,"" Poo said.

But she also argues that caregiving can provide quality jobs at a time when automation and artificial intelligence threaten to displace people in many occupations. ""We know for sure care jobs will not be automated in the near term, nor can they be outsourced,"" she said.

The normal economic laws of supply and demand should boost wages naturally - if the market for caregiving labor was a normal market. But it is not.

Two-thirds of long-term care in the United States is funded by the federal Medicaid program, with the remainder paid through private commercial insurance or out-of-pocket. Medicaid payment policies vary widely among the states, but cash-strapped Medicaid programs have limited ability to boost wages, and Medicaid determines reimbursement rates for the payrolls of health providers, limiting the impact of labor market demand. Outside of Medicaid, the insurance market for long-term care is dysfunctional, with only a very small fraction of older households having purchased commercial policies.

NDWA is part of a coalition working to advance an innovative approach to funding care through social insurance programs in the states. Proposals to create publicly funded long-term care benefits have been advanced in seven states: California, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, New York and Washington. In most cases, the programs would be financed through an additional tax on payroll or income.

It has been clear for some time that social insurance can provide part of the answer to the nation's long-term care funding dilemma. In 2016, three reports developed by a nonpartisan consortium of researchers, representing an ideological middle ground, called for streamlining private long-term care insurance to make it work better, but also covering the most extreme risk through publicly financed insurance (https://reut.rs/2T4wY2n). This approach makes eminent sense, and states could provide the catalyst to get the country moving.

As Poo points out, a win-win is available: meeting the surging demand for caregiving while creating quality jobs for millions of Americans. ""These jobs will be a large share of the jobs of the future,"" she said. ""Just like we turned manufacturing jobs from poverty wage, dangerous jobs into jobs with real economic mobility, we can and should do the same for care jobs.""

Dear Barkha

Thank you for your 'support', but alas much like the gifts of the gods in Greek tragedies, your support comes with double-digit compound interest, which you make clear through your piece -- that your positions are based on reciprocity. I, therefore, reject your support, which I never sought in the first place.

The only person this exposes as a hypocrite is you. Additionally, this demonstrates that you are utterly clueless about policy issues, legal principles, systems and context across the world. How can someone who pens such an infantile piece and could legitimately star in the sequel to 'Clueless' ever become a 'top journalist'?

Let's start with human rights. See Barkha, after the Niira Radia episode, and your article in ThePrint on me, I do understand that you consider positions taken by a journalist as being based on quid pro quo - 'you support me, I support you'. I, on the other hand, regard it to be unethical. Unlike you, who arrives at a position based on kitty party gossip, I actually research and read about anthropological trends and back my positions up with solid statistics.

Also read: What if Barkha Dutt had joked about Konark Temple's erotica instead of Abhijit Iyer Mitra?

Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International are despicable organisations, who have wreaked havoc on millions of lives through their calling for and support of regime change operations. I've written about it here. But since reading is not your forte, let me make another attempt.

Let's start with the quarter of a million (some say up to 700,000) civilians who died as result of the US invasion of Iraq, based on exaggerated literature on atrocities provided by these groups.

Not content with the havoc they wreaked there, they've continued to provide similar justifications in Libya and Syria, and essentially acted as an enabler of interventions by the US.

You may schmooze with these high society enablers of horrific mass strife over glasses of Dom Perignon, but sadly their support for my freedom doesn't absolve them. Do you know how NGO funding works? Why every problem has to be overstated, so that funders will cough up money? Why a regime change operation boost NGO funding as it is seen as 'concrete policy influence'? No? Clueless about that as well?

Tell me Barkha, in your unwatchable, giggly, school girl interview of Hillary Clinton, why didn't you haul her over the coals for Libya? Thousands killed and a stable society completely destroyed as a result of her command responsibility I guess is not as important to you as her fight for gender rights?

Second, while you were spewing uninformed, semi-literate hot air, my Right-wing friends were busy working quietly behind the scenes to have me released. That they sought no acknowledgement or public recognition shows they actually cared about what happened to me, as opposed to your worthless, narcissistic, public posturing. Guess what? It was those covert interventions and not your 'support' that ensured I was treated well and initiated the process of the Odisha government dropping charges against me. But I guess after covering the political beat for over two decades you still haven't figured out how this country works, says more about your undeserved 'celebrity' status than it does about my hypocrisy.

Yes Barkha, I'm not a victim, and, I never will adopt the professional victimhood you seek refuge in so often. Let's take your quote of my tweet about Gauri Lankesh. The first in that series was about how she had been convicted by a court of law for printing fake news, and yet she got a state funeral, involving expensive sandalwood, a gun salute, and was draped in the flag. This was while people like you were going hammer and tongs at Jayant Sinha for garlanding undertrials, not convicts, in a cow lynching case. One of your ilk challenged me and I replied that lynch mobs were spurred on by fake news of the kind Gauri spread. Clueless? Barkha, do try reading up on the mentality of pogroms and how they're spread by rumour mongering in pre-industrial societies. Incidentally, the court did hold that Gauri Lankesh did not take 'due care' before publishing articles, enough to merit a conviction. Just so you know 'intent' is a critical element of conviction in Indian and Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.

Also read: No, Odisha isn't North Korea, it can't jail people for jokes

I do remember the name of Lois Sofia, but do you remember the names of Vinod Mehta, Yogesh Kumar Sheetal and Chaitanya Kunte? See Barkha, with Sophia, what you fail to mention is, I posted the sections of the DGCA rules that clearly mark her actions in an aviation zone as prosecutable in no uncertain terms, punishable for upto a year, and I supported her right to call Narendra Modi a fascist, just not create a ruckus and intimidate a passenger in a high-security area. Curiously, it seems you tried to get Yogesh hounded out of IIMC for precisely the same reason. The difference was that Yogesh was sloganeering against you in a place where he had every right to, while Sophia was doing so in a high security, restricted space where the laws against disorderly behaviour are clear, and ruthlessly enforced for good reason since 9/11. But then again, your inability to absorb the nuances of any kind of law, leave alone security, shines through.

Your alleged 'insights' are simply phantasmagoria generated by those 'reciprocity' deals you, by your own admission, love so much. If you had, indeed gone through my timeline, you'd have seen me oppose my Right-wing friends and support the Congress' right to abuse the Prime Minister, and on many occasions support outrageously provocative tweets against Hindu gods, simply because they had not called for violence in any way. You also, in your usual Goebbelsian way, left out that I called for machine-gunning Ram Rahim's supporters when they rioted post his conviction, and asked for the same for ""Lefty scum"" who were engaging in violence. You see Barkha, try reading Steve Pinker, or Yuval Harari, or Ian Morris for real knowledge on how the states' monopoly on violence and its use in the long run produces stable, free societies when paired with disruptive industrialisation.

Now, try googling the word 'segue'. It's what I used in the Karnataka assembly case of sentencing editors to jail to draw attention to Kashmiri newspaper editors inciting and, in some cases, giving meeting points and times in code to stone pelters. But I don't expect you to get it. But what rankles me is that in addition to your research skills being so poor, you also seem to think journalists must be above the law, no matter how fatal their actions and how transparent their collusion.

You see Barkha, unlike you, I have only tweeted for prosecution against violence or genocide denial, but never coupled my tweets with legal action. Far more advanced democracies like France and Germany actually have laws against such genocide denial, and in the US the Anti Defamation League uses civil suits in the absence of genocide denial laws. Your verbal protests, on the other hand, were accompanied by actions - not against actions but against speech. Mine weren't. Who's the free speech supporter and who the hypocrite now, eh?

As for your deliberate attempt to solicit pity and make everything about yourself by asking ""what would happen if I did this?"", well sorry to disappoint you, but 'absolutely nothing'. Given that you weren't even summarily investigated for your telephone conversations during Radiagate that supposedly tried to help those seeking to influence government formation, or when you allegedly outed positions during army operations, we know that whatever else would have happened to you, it wouldn't be jail. In all likelihood, some no-name Twitter bots would have made less than credible threats, which, given your modus operandi, you would have taken to town and won some kind of international victimhood award as you tried to do with my arrest.

But I realise now that you're not evil, you're simply an utter mediocrity, desperately trying anything to stay relevant. I truly misjudged you, and for that, I apologise profusely. You don't deserve my or anybody else's malice. You deserve our pity, you're not a bad person, just a failing, flailing megalomaniac.

A government order on December 17, 2018, states that the SLAC will comprise the Vice Chairman, Kerala State Higher Education Council, as chairman, and Vice Chancellors of all State universities and Member Secretary of the council (convener) as members.

The Hindu has learnt that the decision to replace the members of the earlier body with Vice Chancellors was taken following opposition from universities, which feared that such a committee will have an overarching role over it.

Eight of the 15-member SLAC approved by the government on November 1 were experts in various fields representing reputed institutions across the country.

Anurag Kumar, Director, Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore; Balan Nambiar, artist and former chairman of Kerala Lalithakala Akademi, New Delhi; and C.P. Chandrasekharan of the Centre for Economic Studies and Planning, School of Social Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, were among them.

The Kerala State Higher Education Council had recommended formation of such a committee in July for the disposal of complaints related to the nomenclature of academic programmes/degrees and according approval/recognition equivalency.

The latest government order has made it clear that universities/higher educational institutions/employment agencies/employers shall refer unsettled issues of nomenclature of academic programmes/degrees and their approval/recognition/equivalency to the KSHEC and place it before the SLAC.

The new norms approved by the government states that all universities, higher educational institutions, agencies and employers shall recognise the degrees awarded by national institutes such as IITs, IISc, NITs, IISERs, and other national-level stand-alone institutions funded by the government.

All universities/higher educational institutions/employers in the State shall recognise the BS/MS degrees of IISERs, IISc, State/Central universities and other higher educational institutions funded by the government.

No equivalency/recognition shall be insisted upon for degrees obtained from national institutes such as IITs, IISc, NITs, IISERs, or other institutions recognised by the University Grants Commission."

EnviroBuild, a UK-based sustainable building materials company, announced on Tuesday, 18 December, that it would be using Dermophis donaldtrumpi as the name for the amphibian with no legs and poor eyesight.

The company says the name still will need to undergo peer review, but that other animals have been named after presidents in the past.

The name was chosen by Aidan Bell, the boss of the firm which paid thousands at an auction for the right, The Guardian reported.

Trump in June last year withdrew the US from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits countries to keeping a limit on rising global temperatures.

'It's the Perfect Name'

The small creature is blind and has an ability to bury its head in the ground. These features, Bell said, match the US leader's opinion on climate change.

The company said Trump's was ""the perfect name"" for the limbless animal.

The Panamanian underground amphibians are particularly vulnerable to global warming.

Dermophis donaldtrumpi, 10 centimetres in length and belonging to group of snake-like animals called caecilians, was recently found in Panama by a group of scientists.

Its naming rights were auctioned off in a fundraiser for Rainforest Trust, a non-profit rainforest conservation organisation, the report said.

The winning bid of 34,478 US dollars was made by Aidan Bell, the head of a UK-based sustainable building materials company called EnviroBuild.

""It is the perfect name. Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning 'blind', perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change.""Aidan Bell

Bell said Trump's worldview resembled a caecilian's, whose eyes can only detect light and dark.

""Capable of seeing the world only in black and white. Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese,"" he added.

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced.

But Trump, whose administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda, has accused those scientists of having a ""political agenda"" and cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the Earth's rising temperatures.

""I don't know that it's man-made,"" he said in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes in October. ""I'm not denying climate change but [temperatures] could very well go back,"" he added, without offering evidence.

He justified this decision by asserting that he had been elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris and the deal disadvantaged US businesses and workers.

Caecilians lost their limbs at least 60 million years ago to better burrow in the earth, and live almost entirely underground.

""Burrowing its head underground helps Donald Trump when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change and [he has] also appointed several energy lobbyists to the Environment Agency, where their job is to regulate the energy industry,"" Bell said."

A happy employee is often an engaged employee -- dictated by this wisdom, a few organisations are allowing their employees to ""customise"" their holiday calendar. Besides state-declared holidays, they can choose to mark ""their holidays"" drawing from a special reserve.

Recently, employees of Sasken Technologies got their holiday calendar for 2019. Only that before it was formally handed out to them, the employees themselves were engaged in deciding on its features.

It was a democratic process that brought every employee on board. Associates from the four locations of the company in India voted through a virtual ballot box, thereby picking five days they wanted included in the company's 2019 holiday calendar. The company observes 10 holidays in a calendar year, which includes both mandatory and company vacation. Based on voting, employees got four additional festival holidays. They would have these holidays in lieu of four Saturdays.

A flexible holiday is another feature that has been adopted by some companies. By virtue of this system, employees get to celebrate days that are important to them, but are not on the official common holiday list.

At Tally Solutions Private Limited, name the festival and you will find it mentioned in the calendar. More than 50 festivals find a mention. The company has offices in more than 20 locations, and allowing employees to pick and choose festivals that appeal the most to them, make them feel valued.

Similarly, at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions, associates get to choose five festival holidays from a pool of 19. This is apart from the mandatory national holidays.

Zubin Zack, managing director, O.C.Tanner, a global rewards-and-recognition consultant, says the holiday calendar is an investment a company makes in its employees' well-being and happiness. It involves planning and feedback from employees. ""When such a calendar is well-designed, employees can plan in advance,"" says Zack.

In 2018, we pushed the Dussehra holiday from a Thursday to Friday to allow employees to get an extended weekend, he says.

Various studies have shown that for millennials, remuneration is not the main factor encouraging them to stay in a job.

The gift of flexibility is greatly valued by them as it enables them to get the most out of life.

At Cigna TTK Health Insurance, an employee is entitled to 20 days of paid leave along with eight days of casual leave. A quarterly report concerning leave utilisation of all employees is shared with the respective managers.

This not only helps the supervisors to keep track of every employee's accumulated leave, but also puts them in a position where they can encourage their subordinates to plan their holiday. At Ingersoll Rand, the annual calendar is kept open to add more days of leave to it, if necessary.

A company that does not want to be named revealed that it approached a B-school to make its annual leave calendar more employee-friendly, by incorporating features that will let them have a personalised leave structure.

Some employers offer bottomless holidays, which is basically ""take as many days of leave as you want to. Just ensure the work gets done"".

Job site Indeed offer its associates an Open Paid Time Off (PTO) or an unlimited leave policy, wherein employees can take as much time off as they wish.

The company has found that that offering unlimited PTO has checked attrition rate considerably."

The aim is to detect unregistered schools as well as those not adhering to safety norms, officials said.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

Some prominent schools are also giving points to those opting for pick and drop service.

Apart from the mandatory 25 per cent of the total seats reserved for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS)/disadvantaged groups, private schools can select a set of criteria against which they allot specific points to each applicant for admission into nursery or entry level classes.

To ensure that schools don't adopt any arbitrary criteria, the Directorate of Education had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed criteria, including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, parents' education, declaration regarding picking or drop, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent criteria. The DoE said these criteria were ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

But several schools are openly allotting points on such criteria, flouting the guidelines. Mahavir Senior Model School for instance, is giving five points each to children of parents who are non-smokers, vegetarian and teetotalers. Darshan Academy in north Delhi has reserved 15 points to ""freelancers or original research/recognition received in the area or contribution, physical or professional work, (both pro-bono) through a registered NGO or freelancers.""

Some popular schools such as Tagore International School, East of Kailash and Vasant Vihar, Apeejay School in Saket and Pitampura, and Bloom Public School have separate points for areas covered by school transport. In its guidelines, the DoE had pointed out that declaration regarding picking or drop is ""illogical"" and it is the choice of the parents to opt for school transport or not. A senior DoE official said the criteria would be reviewed soon and action would be taken against schools flouting the norms.

""Schools are asking parents' designation, organisation name, PAN card details, annual income, etc... As per a high court order, such screening is banned even if points are not being given for these,"" said Sumit Vohra, founder of admissionsnursery.com, an online forum for parent community. He has sent a complaint to the DoE regarding schools making Aadhaar compulsory, which is against the SC orders."

Among other things, the calendar attempts to canvass the unsung role of these women difference-makers, like never before.

For centuries, women have played an important role in shaping Kashmiri culture, but seldom have their contributions received the recognition they deserve. But now, that is changing.

For the first time, perhaps, young artists have come together to pay homage to women by rolling out a women-centric calendar for 2019. 'Kashmiri Women's Design Collective', an annual calendar in which artists have selected women, who have had an impact on Kashmiri society.

The artists believe they wanted to showcase the strength of these women who, despite the odds, have left their mark in the fields of healthcare, arts, music, education, politics and more.

Onaiza Drabu, 28, an entrepreneur hailing from Gogji Bagh area of Srinagar is one of the main faces behind this venture. The thing that motivated her to launch the calendar, she says, is to empower women and let people know about their contribution.

""We have selected different women artists with a different genre of art who have illustrated their skills by portraying different women and thus contributing in anonymity,"" Onaiza said.

The art varies from watercolour to drawing sketches, digital drawing, and canvas making.

""Everyone's style is different and the thing that stands out is there is an architect who has made a portrait of famous singer Raj Begum through paper cuttings,"" Onaiza said.

The task of carrying out the new venture has been daunting in terms of getting touch with all the artists but the whole process has taken them just months to complete.

""I had some ideas about who to go with,"" Onaiza continued. ""I shared the idea with some of my colleagues and they were so excited to work for this and I must appreciate all of them because each of them worked honestly with passion and within the stipulated time.""

The product is conceptualized by Sonth Kashmir, a quirky Kashmiri stationery brand and developed in collaboration with Koshur Lifestyle, called Koshur Wear, a contemporary brand that celebrates Kashmiri culture.

""At the moment calendar is out for printing and orders have already started through Koshur Wear,"" Onaiza said. ""The calendar will be launched on January 1st 2019.""

Artists involved in the venture have also expressed their happiness after having contributed to it.

One of the artists, Zoya Khan, an architect, who teaches in Architecture School at Bemina, said that the artists picked different women who have contributed and come from different social backgrounds. She chose late Aatiqa Bano, the woman who established and curated a private museum in Sopore.

Zoya said their main concept was to pay homage to these women using different art media and they are happy to represent women as they were intended to. ""We actually stand for equal representation of genders and not victimizing these women, but we acknowledge them as they have contributed in different domains,"" she said.

On talking about how the calendar would shape in the society, Zoya said it is very interesting because the approach is very different.

""These women have been a source of inspiration for we people and we want to carry their legacy forward,"" she said.

Sharing her experience of working through this project, Zoya said it was fun because all of them were artists and being able to create something which ""really inspires you"" and relating to it later, is worthy of a contribution for her.

Nusaibah Khan, 24, another architect, who has done her Bachelors in Architecture from Ahmadabad, said she and Onaiza had some ideas in the past about starting a stationery brand in Kashmir because the 'art representation in the valley is quite less'.

""I was more into documenting heritage structures of Kashmir and all of us were working individually,"" Nusaibah said. ""Onaiza, me and Sama Beg [of Koshur Wear fame] then decided to collaborate and work in the broader perspective and finally the venture paid off.""

She asserted that they tried to get all the artists on a single platform for a common goal of portraying the characters who have contributed vastly but people are yet to get aware of them.

""The feedback has been positive from people here and outside the state and the fact that we are able to deliver the product throughout India makes it interesting,"" Nusaibah said.

These artists want to show the world that despite many challenges people face in Kashmir, people in the conflict zone never lose the desire to live and celebrate their art and culture.

So when the second edition of the Three-day Military Literature festival kick-started recently in Chandigarh, it was indeed a huge crowd puller.

From veterans to serving officers with families in tow to civilians, school children, general public-everyone made a beeline for the three-day extravaganza which had something for everyone.

If the food court saw maximum turnout so did the martial arts display, weaponry and the exhibition of Operation Vijay, Military Arts and Photography exhibition, along with Clarion Call Theatre, which too attracted massive crowds.

However, the highlight of each of the three days was the stimulating panel discussions on varied topics which left the visitors completely in awe.

Surgical Strikes Hype unnecessary

One of the most interesting sessions that took place during the festival was on the topic, 'Role of Cross-Border Operations and Surgical Strikes', wherein Lieutenant General DS Hooda (Retd), who was heading the Northern Command when the much-touted surgical strikes were carried out on September 29, 2016, across the Line of Control (LoC), said that the hype around these strikes were unwarranted.

During the session, Retired Lt Gen Hooda said that the initial euphoria over the success of the surgical strike was natural but the constant hype around it was unwarranted. ""I do think there was too much hype over it. The military operation was important and we had to do it. Now how much should it have been politicised, whether it is right or wrong is something that should be asked to politicians,"" he averred.

In fact, many war veterans citing their own examples on how these strikes are a routine affair seconded Lt Gen Hooda's views and said that the Surgical Strikes' was unnecessarily hyped by the Centre to garner political mileage, endangering India's future defence cross-border responses to inflict enemy damage.

During the discussion, well-known defence expert and commentator Colonel (Retd.) Ajai Shukla cautioned against the recent trend to colour military achievements with political motives. He also underlined the need to maintain operational decency and sanctity of the operations undertaken by the defence forces.

""Success has its burden"", Colonel Shukla said, adding that Pakistan had in fact been emboldened by the strikes as they now know that the Indian government would always be under immense pressure to strike across the border

after each terror attack.

Shukla went on to add that the excessive publicity of the September 2016 strikes, which were an actually reactionary strike to Pakistan's attacks' on Indian Army's Pathankot base and Uri, had set a dangerous benchmark for the Indian political dispensation, which they would find difficult to maintain in the eventuality of future terror attacks.

To a query from the audience, General Hooda said, ""In hindsight, it would have been better had we done it(referring to the surgical strikes) secretly. The aim of any such offensive had to be not only tactical but strategic too, which substantially hampers enemy morale"", he said, adding that he could not say with certainty if India had actually achieved that objective in full measure.

Citing the example of the 1981 Israeli air strikes on Iraqi nuclear sites, which had caused considerable damage, Lt. General (Retd.) NS Brar too underlined the need to ensure the long-term impact on the enemy before undertaking any such operation in future.

Cautioning the political masters against being adventurers, General Brar asked if the political masters would have taken responsibility had there been any causalities in the strikes.

Proposal to have marigold flower declared as a remembrance flower as a tribute to the fallen soldiers

One of the key developments at the Military Literature Festival was the unanimous call by the veterans, experts during the session on ""India's contribution to the World War I"" to moot a proposal to the centre government that orange marigold be declared as a

remembrance flower for honouring the memory of fallen heroes, on the lines of the Red Poppy chosen for by the British government for the same cause.

The proposal, mooted by noted military historian Squadron Leader Rana Chhina, was supported in by all panellists, and it was resolved to formally forward this proposal to the Central Government. The discussion also resulted in a demand for a dedicated war memorial to commemorate the sacrifices of all World War I heroes.

The panellists consisted of Squadron Leader Rana Chhina, Prof David Omissi, Prof. Anju Suri, besides Dr Santanu Das and Lt. Gen. NS Brar, engaged in a discussion that underlined the social and emotional turbulence suffered by soldiers and families during the 1914-1918 War.

Government not keen on taking inputs from Defence Experts, rue Veterans

Another highlight of the event was the plain-speaking by the former officers and war veterans alike who minced no words when it came to India's defence strategy and the way ahead.

Defence experts regretted the reluctance of the central government to take inputs from them in drafting the country's defence strategy and called for brainstorming for a long-term

cohesive combat and defence plan.

At a session on 'Evolving Challenges in Indian Defence', the experts underlined the need for decision-makers to ensure that, along with a booming economy, there should be no shortage of funds for the armed forces.

Gen. VP Malik (Retd), former Chief of Army Staff (COAS) moderated this session while Lt. Gen. KJ Singh (Retd), Col PK Vasudeva (Retd), Lt. Gen. Aditya Singh (Retd) were the panellists.

Lt. Gen. Aditya Singh (Retd) said that China is bringing Artificial Intelligence (AI) in drones, which is equipped with face recognition features. He said that the future of war would be the war of drones and robots along with hypersonic aircrafts. Gen. VP Malik (Retd) said that along with these, the next warfare would also be cyber and space-based.

Col PK Vasudeva (Retd) questioned whether India was spending enough on its Armed forces as compared to China. ""In case of any conflicts, I can frankly say that we will not be able to face as blatantly as we have done in 1971 or 1965. What has happened? The army is basically indulging in counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism operations in Jammu & Kashmir and North East. Our soldiers are suffering because there are a large number of casualties because of lack of equipment, small arms, lack of ammunition etc. This is an economy which is one of the largest in the world, but has not been able to provide the

basic minimum equipment to soldiers,"" he rued.

Giving the example of Israel, he said that the small country was surrounded by 17 of its enemy countries, but still, the entire region was afraid of them. He regretted that the Indian government was spending crores on statues and bullet trains while neglecting the defence budget. Lt Gen KJ Singh (Retd) said India should focus on punitive deterrents against its enemies so that they think twice before initiating any action against our country. He said that our country needs more credible deterrents such as surgical strikes.

Wisdom of spies

No military gathering would be complete without mentioning the Kargil war and therefore, Kargil was a major part of discussion during a session on ""Wisdom of Spies"" wherein former RAW chief A S Dulat disclosed that sufficient Intelligence reports pointing to intrusion of Kargil heights were submitted to the central government just ahead of the Kargil conflict.

Participating in a discussion on 'Wisdom of Spies', Dulat said the intelligence reports were shared with the Centre with all the pointers gathered by the Army before the war had started. Dulat, who was with the Intelligence Bureau at the time of the Kargil conflict, said the vital information was shared with the then Union Home Minister, who was also holding the charge of Deputy Prime Minister.

Earlier, Lt Gen Kamal Davar highlighted the importance of putting all the three defence wings physically under one unified command, with convergence in decision making ensured. Cautioning against the current trend of NSA being the 'Intelligence Czar' of the country, Davar said it was one thing to have information but totally another to act on all available inputs. He also highlighted the need to invest more aggressively in acquiring language mastery in South Asian languages like Mandarin, Sinhalese and Pashto.

Underscoring the need to adopt the technology, he said in the present times, intellect and technology need to be synchronised to achieve desired ends. ""Our covert capability would depend on the marriage of these two aspects"", General Davar added.

Experts call for more indigenous equipment of Information Warfare

Defence experts also called for the development of more indigenous equipment of Information Warfare in the country to build an edge against adversaries in the battlefield.

Participating in a discussion on 'Information Warfare- the new face of war', Lieutenant General (Retd.) Vijay Oberoi said despite major advancements in the field, India was still banking on Information Warfare Techniques imported from other countries, which could be very fatal.

Citing an example, he said that GPRS Technology, belonging to the US, did not perform as well during the Kargil War as was expected to. Lieutenant General (Retd.) Oberoi said that at a time when all forms of weapons, whether nuclear, conventional or sub-conventional, were being managed by computers it was not good that we were still banking on equipment made by others.

In his address, Lieutenant General (Retd.) RS Panwar said that while countries like the US, China and Russia had already taken concrete steps to strengthen their Information Warfare techniques, India was still to take an appropriate call on it. He said that like Army, Navy, Airforce, Space and Cyber Domain, it was also a part of modern warfare.

Lieutenant General (Retd.) Panwar batted for framing new doctrines and new structures, besides adequate skill development to give a major push to Information Warfare in the country.

Another session saw experts advocate a level playing field for private entrepreneurs for boosting Defence production in the country in order to make the country self-reliant in military hardware.

Taking part in a discussion on Military Industrial Base and Make in India, Former Chief of Indian Army General (Retd.) VP Malik said that India was importing 14 per cent of the total arms and ammunition globally, which was more than what China and Pakistan import collectively. He said that in 1992, the Defence Research and Development Organisation had chalked out a 10-year plan under which the then trend of 80 per cent import of weapons and 20 per cent export was to be reversed within ten years. However, General Malik said that in 2005 it was found that exports had increased to just 30 per cent and imports had decreased to 70 per cent."

Griffin's owner, Brittany Hawley, also received a graduate degree in Occupational Therapy. Both attended 100% of their classes together. (AP)

Whenever Brittany Hawley went to class, her loyal service dog Griffin was there. If she needed her cell phone, Griffin would fetch it. Even when she assisted patients as part of an internship, Griffin was there helping out as well.

So, it's only fitting that when Hawley was honoured for receiving her master's degree in occupational therapy from Clarkson University over the weekend, Griffin was once again at her side -- with an honorary diploma of his own.

""I pushed for him to graduate from Day One,"" Hawley said Monday. ""He did everything I did."" The board of trustees of the Potsdam, New York, school honoured the 4-year-old golden retriever at a recognition ceremony Saturday, saying he demonstrated ""extraordinary effort, steadfast commitment and diligent dedication to the well-being and student success"" of Hawley.

Hawley, 25, of Wilson, North Carolina, uses a wheelchair and has chronic pain.

She said Griffin does a wide range of physical tasks for her including opening doors, turning on lights and bringing her items she indicates with a laser pointer. But perhaps more important is the comfort the dog provides amid her relentless, severe pain that causes anxiety and depression.

Hawley got Griffin through ""paws4prisons,"" a program that teaches inmates at West Virginia prisons to train and place high-level assistance dogs.

""The inmates allow many dogs to come up to you and let the dog choose you,"" Hawley said. ""Some dogs were scared of the wheelchair. Griffin jumped right into my lap and licked me across the face."" Hawley and Griffin worked at Fort Bragg in North Carolina during an internship, helping soldiers with mobility impairments as well as psycho-social disorders. Brushing a dog can help improve a patient's range of motion, and stroking him helps ease anxiety, Hawley said.

""My patients would say, 'My therapist today is Brittany and Griffin,'"" she said.

When she applies for jobs, she and Griffin will be a package deal, Hawley said.

""I couldn't participate in anything without him,"" she said. ""I'm so used to him being there."""

The Harvard Business Review's latest ranking of top 100 CEOs includes only 32 MBAs. Since its inception, the proportion of MBAs in this exclusive club has hovered around 30. No wonder, questions are being increasingly raised about the relevance of conventional management education, especially mainstream MBA programmes. Against this background, business schools will do well to pay attention to the work of this year's Nobel laureate Paul Romer, who, incidentally, is a professor at a leading business school. His work in economics highlights the role of ideas and innovation in economic growth. Innovation need not be only technological, but it also spans domains of international trade, public policy and business management. Research and development are keys to innovation.

Of late, leading management institutes in India have increased their focus on research. However, research publications that help institutes to rise in academic rankings do not necessarily make them relevant to practice. Noted management scholar Nirmalya Kumar made a stinging observation about doctoral programmes arguing that, with a few exceptions, most marketing academics did not focus on the issues important to practitioners.

While research is aimed at understanding a phenomenon, development deals with creation. But businesses are seldom contended with mere understanding of phenomenon. They aspire to find solutions to problems. This is often the root cause of the perceived gap between theory and practice of management. If this gulf is to be bridged, business schools will have to shift focus from mere 'research' to 'research and development'. In science and technology domain, the term 'development' is commonly used in conjunction with research. However, the same is rare in business management, at least in academia.

Research does contribute towards solution building, but it is not the only input for the same. Development often calls for imagination and creativity. For instance, study of profile & behaviour of the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) consumers constitutes research. But development of marketing strategy comprising low unit packs in the form of one-rupee shampoo sachets for BOP segment or pay-per-use pricing policy for usage of tractors by small landowner farmers has been a result of ingenuity of entrepreneurs and managers. Management guru CK Prahalad, who brought light on BOP markets, spoke about limitations of 'best practices' and the need to concentrate on 'next practices'. While a researcher can study best practices as they exist, next practices come under the realm of development.

If universities and business schools wish to focus on research and development, they need to raise some fundamental questions related to their research approaches and doctoral programmes. A fundamental difference between natural and social sciences often gets overlooked. In natural sciences, the 'reality' that is being investigated and the research findings that are supposed to facilitate understanding of the 'reality' can be independent of each other. Noted management scholar Sumantra Ghoshal illustrated this very lucidly with an example. He argued that even if a researcher wrongly interprets that the Sun revolves around the Earth and not the other way round, the reality does not change. The existence of objective reality makes it relatively easy for natural scientists to critically assess the evidence. However, in social sciences, the reality can be socially constructed.

Let us take the case of a company trying to expand market for electric cars. Using tools and techniques borrowed from natural sciences, a management researcher can build evidence about how and at what rate the market for petrol and diesel engine driven cars grew. Manufacturers of electric cars can certainly draw a few lessons from this. But these very same methods may not be useful to garner evidence on how electric car market 'can' be grown because the phenomenon of market expansion is yet to unfold. On the other hand, when an engineer tries to develop the first electric car, he/she can develop it in a lab, test it and provide evidence so that the same can be used prospectively. In most managerial situations, 'reality' cannot be constructed in advance of the practice. Since it is difficult to create managerial situations in labs, research techniques that rely on pattern recognition statistically can normally be used only retrospectively.

Moreover, innovation, by definition, amounts to breaking free from the pattern. A formula that led to the success of one organisation at one point of time can be intentionally disrupted by managers in competing organisations. Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad, in their best seller 'Competing for the Future', cite examples from photocopying and earthmoving equipment industry, wherein smaller players like Canon and Komatsu intentionally adopted practices that were very different from their respective leading competitors -- Xerox and Caterpillar. While researchers try to understand rules of the game, innovation results from changing those very rules.

If business schools want to retain relevance, they will have to make systematic efforts at according academic legitimacy to 'developmental' work of scholars. IIT Delhi has taken a step in this direction. It has decided to help doctoral scholars in converting their theses into ventures. Business schools need to remind themselves that the likes of Peter Drucker, Henry Mintzberg, Michael Porter, CK Prahalad, Sumantra Ghoshal or W Chan Kim attained status of revered gurus not because their researches involved esoteric tools and techniques, but because their work extended beyond research and led to the development of innovative solutions to managerial problems."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

The worldwide movement of Arya Samaj founded by Maharshi Dayanand, to raise intellectual, moral and spiritual stature of humankind is well coordinated by its apex body in Delhi, called Sarvadeshik Arya Pratinidhi Sabha. The apex leadership began to organize a large-scale annual gathering from the year 2006 in Delhi, shifting to a different country every year but returning to Delhi every 6 years in the age-old tradition of Kumbh Mela (Fair). So, 2012 also saw a huge gathering in Delhi, followed by the recent one during October 25 to 28, 2018.

Arya Samaj Houston was recognized as the Model Arya Samaj among thousands of units worldwide for immaculate functioning and wide-ranging contribution, principally through:

· Vedic education via Sunday morning assemblies

· DAV Montessori School, a regular elementary school

· DAV Sanskriti School, the Sunday school

The contingent from Arya Samaj Houston attended the Delhi gathering with great enthusiasm led by Dev & Sushma Mahajan who pioneered its continuous rise since inception. One afternoon session in the main hall began with the handover of an illuminating shield to Dev Mahajan witnessed by the cheering crowd of about 100,000. Yes, you read it right - the figure is one hundred thousand from all over the globe. The statistics of the gathering are mind blowing:

· Two hundred thousand people attended the 4-day event, ferried from airports and train stations at no cost, provided room and food at no cost

· 3.3 million square foot of covered area in the main hall and other 19 halls holding parallel events to every taste

· 35,000 people stayed in the makeshift tents in the public ground with individual beds

· About 2000 people from 32 countries were accommodated in star hotels for free

· 10,000 individuals performed Havan in unison, a spectacular site at dusk, a new world record, witnessed by the Guinness Book team

· A large-scale event without a single untoward incident

Arya Samaj Houston made its presence felt in more ways than the above recognition. The event was inaugurated by the president of India and we were told that the president attended for the first time an event in the public ground; what an exception he made to Arya Samaj to express his gratitude that it was Arya Samaj and its premier educational institute in Kanpur (DAV College) that provided his education when he hailed from a family with meager means. And, the icing on the cake was the only song that was presented in presence of the president; its lyrics by our own, director of the Sanskriti School, Acharya Kavitaji, dedicated to Rishi Dayanand. Another noteworthy event was a specialist 4-day workshop on Vedic Unified Theory of Matter & Consciousness for the foreign delegates, conceived and designed by our own Acharya Harish-Chandraji that ran parallel, in a separate nearby venue."

""The two leaders reaffirmed their unwavering commitment and support for increased cooperation in combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations both within the region and elsewhere, said the Joint Statement issued at the end of the talks.

""Both sides agreed to enhance bilateral cooperation on issues of common concern, including piracy, terrorism, organised crime, drugs and human trafficking. It was also agreed to intensify cooperation in the areas of training and capacity building of Maldives Police Service and Maldives National Defence Force,"" the statement said.

""In furtherance of the shared recognition that the security interests of both the countries are interlinked in the region,"", the statement reiterated their assurance of being mindful of ""each other's concerns and aspirations for the stability of the region and not allowing their respective territories to be used for any activity inimical to the other"".

The two leaders agreed to strengthen cooperation to enhance maritime security in the Indian Ocean Region through coordinated patrolling and aerial surveillance, exchange of information and capacity building.

This is President Solih's first foreign visit after assuming office in November and also comes within a month of visit of Prime Minister Modi to the Maldives.

Mr Modi had visited Male during the swearing-in ceremony of new dispensation headed by Mr Solih after a keenly watched election.

Prime Minister had invited Mr Solih for a state visit to India.

During the talks, Prime Minister Modi informed the decision by the Government of India to provide 1000 additional slots over next 5 years for training and capacity building in diverse fields including judicial, policing and law-enforcement, audit and financial management, local governance, community development, IT, e-governance, sports, media, youth and women empowerment, leadership, innovation & entrepreneurship, art & culture.

Prime Minister announced provision of financial assistance up to US$ 1.4 billion in the form of budgetary support, currency swap and concessional lines of credit to fulfill the socio-economic development programmes of the Maldives.

President Solih reaffirmed his government's ""India-First Policy"", and commitment to working together closely with India.

""He appreciated the generous assistance provided by the Government of India to Maldives, and identified various areas for developmental cooperation, including private sector involvement in development of housing and infrastructure, water and sewerage systems in the outlying islands, healthcare, education and tourism"".

Both leaders emphasized the need to improve connectivity between the two countries through the establishment of enabling infrastructure that would promote the exchange of goods and services, information, ideas, culture and people.

Recognizing the importance of facilitating people-to-people exchanges and travel, the leaders welcomed the new Agreement on Visa Facilitation signed on Monday. Prime Minister Modi noted that the new Agreement will address the common concerns and ensure that people-to-people contacts are enhanced. The Maldives is one of the very few countries with which India has a visa free arrangement.

President Solih expressed his happiness at the signing of the Agreement, as this will facilitate many Maldivians who send their children to school in India, to be able to accompany them. The Agreement signed by two Foreign Ministers Sushma Swaraj and Shahid Abdulla will also facilitate easier visa arrangements for Maldivian citizens and their families, to come to India for medical treatment.

""Both leaders emphasised the need to ensure seamless movement of people between both countries,"" the statement said.

In his press statement, Mr Modi recorded his appreciation that the 'people-centric development' vision of the new Maldives dispensation.

""India is always with you,"" Prime Minister said.

Giving a hint on Maldives new dispensation's clear preference to India in its diplomatic and bilateral ties, the new Foreign Minister of Maldives Abdulla Shahid visited India in November within a week of swearing in of the new regime in that country."

Illustration: Uttam Ghosh/Rediff.com

India must have vernacular public intellectuals who can and should 'grasp the popular as the most efficacious language and mode of resistance,' said Grant Farred, adding, 'Vernacularity signals the discursive turning away from the accepted, dominant intellectual modality and vocabulary and the adoption of a new positioning and idiomatic language'.

In recent decades, majoritarian right wing reaction emerging across many countries has partly to do with the communalisation of vernacular spaces. Jenny White's Islamist Mobilization in Turkey (2002) demonstrated the majoritarian shift of Turkey through vernacular spaces during the 1980-1990, paving the way for Recep Taiyip Erdogan's rise to power.

About Uttar Pradesh in India, Zoya Hasan's Quest for Power (1997) demonstrated how certain Hindi dailies peddled majoritarianism in the late 1980s.

What about the case of Urdu language? Well, faced with multiple problems, most Urdu news periodicals are preoccupied rather with theology, inṭra-Muslim sub-sectarian debates, and creative literature-literary criticism.

This makes it important for us to know about Professor Riazur Rahman Sherwani of Aligaṛh, an academic who, in his late 90s, has been constantly writing in Urdu newspapers since 1949.

Not many Urdu intellectuals could possibly be as frank and harsh against Muslim conservatism and communalism in independent India as Professor Sherwani (born 1924). He is an intellectual whose recognition as one has been woefully inadequate despite the acknowledgement of his scholarship and teaching among the Urdu intelligentsia.

Most of his writings, including his autobiography (Dhoop Chhaon) and a compilation of his columns/rejoinders and essays, published in various Urdu news periodicals during 1949-2015 (Masael o Mabahis), have come out this year.

His relentless interventions on almost every issue concerning India and Indians underscore the necessity and relevance of his ideas in our woeful times.

In his autobiography, Professor Sherwani has chosen to speak only about his student days, spanning 1941-1949, besides an introductory chapter on his aristocratic Afghan ancestry.

His palatial house in Aligaṛh offered hospitality to stalwarts such as Gandhiji, Nehru, Jinnah, Azad, Rafi Kidwai, Liaqat Ali Khan, etc.

Maulana Azad's 'letters' from Ahmednagar prison (compiled as Ghubar-e-Khatir) are addressed to Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani (1867-1950), Procfessor Riazur Rahman's grandfather.

A frank narrative of these eight formative years of his life testify to the evolution of his worldview informed by wide studies and deep insights and observations about the events happening close around him, mostly political.

By his own admission, he has always been taking a keen interest in politics, though without formally joining any party. It has been amply clear to him, he underlines, that there is absolutely no conflict between religion (mazhab) and nation (watan), only if both the categories have well-defined boundary limits.

The universal and spiritual content of religion, he insists, equips politics with ethics. According to him, this is what secularism is, and that freedom is the birthright of every human.

Both these considerations make him arrive at a conclusion that inter-faith harmony -- Muttahidah Qaumiyat (united or composite nationalism) -- is a sine qua non for pluralistic nations to march forward.

He has a keen memory of the details of India's Partition to which he was vehemently opposed. He justifies the creation of Bangladesh and believes that Kashmir's better future is linked preferably with India, even though, he adds, India has not been fair and judicious with Kashmiris.

His publications against communal hatred and for the secular democracy of India abhor the homogeneity espoused by reactionaries of all hues.

His columns articulating the problems of India's Muslims display a strong optimism that India's secular democracy offers enough scope to ameliorate all these problems. He is as sharp against majoritarian communalism as against minority communalism.

His column (December 1973) criticising the Congress and Communists for aligning with the Muslim League in Kerala in the early decades of Independence is a sharp and brave one.

The collection of his columns deserves to be rendered into English, Nagri, and other Indian vernacular languages.

He hates the personality cult even while being deeply impressed by Gandhiji, Nehru, Maulana Azad, Jayaprakash Narayaṇ, and many more. His pen, however, spares none, the only exception being Gandhiji and Azad, in whom he hardly sees any fault.

His harshest criticism is reserved for Jinnah and Maulana Maududi (1903-1979). His earliest columns considered these two as the biggest of villains, and unambiguously assert that a lot of problems faced by Muslims of the subcontinent are because of Jinnah's communal separatism and Maududi's ideology of a theocratic State.

He frankly admits that till 1937 he had a little soft corner for the League even though he had doubts about its class base and ideological positions, particularly its lack of anti-colonial stance.

In 1939, when the League observed the Day of Deliverance following the resignation of Congress ministries in the provinces, his doubts about the League were confirmed and ever since he remained vehemently opposed to it.

As a student activist, he confronted the League sympathisers at AMU, who included his father who was also serving in a higher position in the university.

His understanding about the causes of Partition is: Jinnah and the League who asked for it were primarily responsible for the vivisection.

British imperialists played their own roles though the majoritarianism of the Hindu Mahasabha-RSS as also such tendencies within the lower ranks of the Congress, was no less significant a factor.

Sherwani records in his autobiography that at the AMU High School (Minto Circle), Syed Mohammed Tonki taught him history and it was he who nurtured anti-colonialism and patriotism in him through history classes. Tonki was emphatic about Hindu-Muslim unity to fight British colonialism.

Tonki's extraordinary and unforgettable mentoring of students, in drama and cricket, has been acknowledged by distinguished alumni such as the late actor Saeed Jaffery (1929-2015) in his memoirs, and by the late historian Mushirul Hasan as well in one of his columns in the Agra supplement of The Times of India.

Ironically, such a fierce opponent of India's Partition as Sherwani was pushed into Pakistan after Independence. This is very poignantly described as part of his life story.

In August 1947, while doing his MA at AMU, he was at Kasauli in a sanatorium for the treatment of his ailing sister.

When Partition occurred, he, his mother, younger brother, and the terminally ill sister, were forced out of the Kasauli sanatorium to Kalka, from where they were pushed into a Lahore-bound train. The fear and anxiety that enveloped the train is described more powerfully by Intizar Husain (1923-2016) in his memoir Chiraghon Ka Dhuan: Yadon ke Pachaas Baras (1999).

In Lahore, Sherwani's sister eventually died. While stuck in Lahore for several months, he completed his MA (Arabic) from the Oriental College, Lahore.

He then managed to come back to India after a lot of difficulty.

Sherwani minces no words in revealing that the theology classes at AMU didn't ever add to his knowledge.

On the Hindu Code Bill, his column (in 1955) was quite forthright; that the Indian State must interfere to legislate on all personal laws.

He, however, opposed the Uniform Civil Code. Instead, he suggested that the Indian government should ask each community to form select committees and their proposals for reforms should then be debated in Parliament for legislation.

He castigated Muslim conservatives on this count who altogether denied any State intervention to reform personal laws.

In May 1985, when Muslim conservatives and gender reactionaries stood up against Shah Bano going to the Supreme Court, he subjected them to scathing criticism. He condemned them for neither reforming the Shariat nor letting the hapless lady get justice from the judiciary.

Being an Arabic scholar, he argues that even the Quran does provide for maintenance to the divorced, helpless, old lady.

He also argued that even Islam in its spirit is actually against polygamy as it is against slavery. He always favoured a rational interpretation of the Quran informed by social realities.

He is extensively well read in English literature and particularly impressed with Matthew Arnold's Culture and Anarchy.

Surprisingly, this collection (Masael o Mabahis) of his newspaper interventions, doesn't include his views on:

The imposition of Emergency in 1975 (whereas, he has good words for Jayaprakash Narayaṇ and his role in the Quit India Movement); On parliamentary legislation against the Supreme Court verdict for Shah Bano in 1986 (though, as said earlier, he did write against Muslim conservatives when her case went to the Supreme Court in 1985); and Almost nothing on caste among India's Muslims. These three omissions are striking. Or, maybe, his columns on these subjects could not be retrieved for publication in Masael o Mabahis.

In his polite but unambiguous words, he complains against the majoritarian prejudices of Purushottam Das Tandon (1882-1962), Sampurṇanand (1891-1969), and those Muslims who had once wished to join the Bhartiya Jan Sangh.

His articulation is candid, lucid and frank. He argued (in 1966) that there are two kinds of forces, one communal (among both Muslims and Hindus) and the other secular.

Negotiation between the two is uncalled for. One has to be clear about one's options.

He, however, keeps adding that the ruling Congress is not the sole monopoliser of secularism in the Indian Republic.

He says that India can be strengthened by all non-communal forces -- the Congress, Socialists, Left forces, in competitive and complementary ways.

He urged Muslims to further the ideologies of any of these forces, and sternly warned against forming any Muslim exclusive political party.

He was particularly associated with two Urdu newspapers in Aligaṛh, Naya Hindustan (launched on August 15, 1948), and Jamhoor (launched on January 26, 1950). These ran roughly up to the late 1950s. Their objective was to wrest the common Muslims out of the clutches of the conservatives and to shun their isolation syndrome.

He contributed his columns, rejoinders, letters to editors, in almost every important Urdu newspaper of Delhi, UP, and in Paṭna, which he subscribed to and has preserved all files in his residence.

His understanding about communal violence was that these were always motivated by the politics of polarisation and that its recurrence had to do with the failure of the criminal justice system. In this regard, at least once, he is unsparing even about Nehru in the case of the Jabalpur riots of 1961.

He has neatly categorised sections for his columns on communalisation of society and polity, and on communal violence.

His columns and travelogues of the early 1950s, castigate the failing state of Pakistan which according to him had its genesis in exclusionary nationalism.

It won't be an exaggeration to argue that his columns are necessary reading for any researcher working on India's Muslims since Independence.

He wrote around 30 obituaries. These include people of all ideological shades: Acharya Narendra Dev (1889-1956; a Gandhian socialist); K G Mashruwala (editor of Gandhiji's weekly Harijan), Syama Prasad Mookerjee (1901-1953; the Hindu Mahasabha leader), Gandhiji, Maulana Azad (Azad's passing was greatest of all tragedies, according to him), Nehru, Rafi Kidwai (1894-1954), Asaf Ali (1888-1953), among others.

Sherwani detested Jinnah's unpalatable words of condolence over Gandhiji's assassination, and he voiced it in Lahore, in the midst of Jinnah's fans. Even in his death, and a tragic one at that, Jinnah had identified Gandhiji as only a Hindu leader.

In Sherwani's list of obituaries, some conspicuous omissions are Ram Manohar Lohia (1910-1967) and the Arabic scholar Ali Miyaṅ Nadvi (1914-1999). They do not seem to have drawn his attention at all.

Despite a versatile intellect and brave interventions on every contentious issue, this intrepid writer has not been identified as a public intellectual even within AMU. This is quite intriguing. Had it anything to do with his personality trait of preferring isolation?

Or is it a reflection on AMU campus society in particular and north Indian Muslim society in general that he has not been raised to the status of a public intellectual?

Why this indifference to Sherwani on the part of the Urdu literati/intelligentsia?

His son Madihur Rahman Sherwani (Suhaib), formerly a teacher of English literature and a CPI whole-timer, seems to suggest that Professor Sherwani is essentially a self-effacing man. Some of his contemporaries and colleagues make similar suggestions about his personality.

Another pressing question that crops up here is: Why have academicians been failing in mentoring and training students who could emerge as progressive interventionists in academic as well as popular (journalistic) domains towards strengthening India's pluralistic traditions of politics and social harmony?

Professor Sherwani, who in his late 90s, has hearing and visual problems, but has not given up on studies and is always surrounded with books.

May he live longer, healthier and happier.

And most important of all, liberal progressive academia must pay attention to writing and mentoring vernacular columnists.

That will ensure greater hopes for a better India.

A source involved in the project said, ""We are planning to air programmes round-the-clock. To start with, programmes would be aired only 8 to 10 hours for two to three months from the day of launch. The department has packages in hand for 3,000 hours which is more than sufficient to telecast without interruptions. Work to schedule programmes are under process.""

Videos lessons - mostly for newly introduced concepts and difficult lessons - which practically explain the concepts of academic syllabus would be aired along with short videos on moral values. Videos to educate students about traditional games, Yoga and Thirukkural would also be aired, the source said.

As talents found in government school students and teachers remain hidden, teachers who had adopted innovative methods in their schools and students with real talent would be featured in the channel.

Live classes would also be taken for students preparing for competitive examinations like NEET and CA, the source said, adding that awareness would also be created about important announcements, government schemes and scholarship programmes.

""90% of the programmes would be aired in Tamil and a programme is designed to train the students in English language,"" the source added.

""A group of teachers from all the 32 districts is roped in for the project. Almost all the videos to be aired in the channel were created by the teachers along with outsourced technicians.

A total of Rs 1.35 crore has been allotted to procure equipment, install and to connect the studio with TACTV station through fiber cable. The integrated studio will function from Anna Centenary Library in Chennai, the official said, adding that tender to carry out the process was already floated.

Welcoming the move of the department, a government schoolteacher said it would attract students towards schools.

""Most of the times, teachers in rural regions don't get recognition for their hard work and innovations. When such teachers are recognized and featured, it would encourage other teachers to adopt innovation,"" the teacher said, adding that it would change the public's perspective about government schools."

In his famous book, Man and the State, the French philosopher Jacques Maritain draws attention to the universal essence of human rights above ideologies. He says, ""The recognition of a particular category of rights is not the privilege of one school of thought at the expense of the others; it is no more necessary to be a follower of Rousseau to recognise the rights of the individual man than it is to be a Marxist to recognise the economic and social rights."" At the time Maritain was writing these lines, he was deeply concerned with the political and philosophical situations of Europe and the world post World War II and during the Cold War. The practical challenge for a philosopher like Maritain was to formulate the means which could help people around the world to discuss their differences while respecting and assuring human dignity for everyone on the planet. Maritain was right to underline that a dignified life was based on the establishment of the basic needs and rights of every individual independent of his or her race, language, culture, religion or nationality. The core idea of this optimistic philosophy -- that states and peoples can discuss practical issues and arrive at mutual agreements despite ideological differences -- probably had an effect on René Cassin, the French legal scholar, who was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in drafting the final version of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.

In his speech to the UNESCO General Council in 1947, Maritain asked the key question about the challenge of overcoming obstacles posed by diverse cultures and ideological differences throughout human history. ""How,"" he asked, ""can we imagine an agreement of minds between men who come from the four corners of the globe and who not only belong to different cultures and civilisations, but are of antagonistic spiritual associations and schools of thought?"" Unsurprisingly, the members of the Human Rights Commission, under the leadership of Eleanor Roosevelt (First Lady of the United States from March 1933 to April 1945), charged with the drafting of the declaration, were all well aware of the importance of this challenge. In that sense, from the very beginning, their task was as much philosophical as it was judicial. As such, in the manner of Maritain, who was in search of a new universal ethics, the commission members extended the theoretical foundations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights beyond ""the narrow limits of the Western tradition"". Maintaining that human rights transcend religious and cultural differences, Cassin, nonetheless, recognised that they embodied generations of rights expressed by their humanistic and natural law foundations. Moreover, neither Cassin, nor the other drafters of the Universal Declaration were unaware of the contributions and influences of ancient philosophies and religions to the modern understanding of rights. However, influenced by the spirit of the French Revolution and its revolutionary motto ""Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité"", Cassin identified the four foundational blocks of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as ""dignity, liberty, equality, and brotherhood"". By ""dignity"", developed in the first two articles of the universal declaration, Cassin referred to all the values which were shared by individuals beyond their sex, race, creed and religion. As for ""liberty"", it included articles three to 19, and emphasised on rights related to individual life, liberty and personal security. Under ""equality"", Cassin understood rights related to the public sphere and political participation (articles 20 to 26), and, under ""brotherhood"" were economic, social and cultural rights (articles 27 and 28). Finally, the three last articles (28, 29 and 30) focused on the conditions in which these could be realised in society and the state.

However, the concept of rights -- long recognised in historically significant laws, charters and constitutions such as the Magna Carta (1215), American Declaration of Independence (1776), Bill of Rights (1791) and the French Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789), and at the foundation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 -- did not succeed in overcoming the approaches of the states and individuals who distinguished between ""themselves"" and ""others"". Let us not forget that out of then 58 members of the United Nations, only 48 ratified the universal declaration while Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the Soviet Union, Poland, Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Byelorussia and Czechoslovakia abstained, because they were worried that the moral appeal of the document would endanger the sanctity of their domestic laws and regulations.

Consequently, despite Maritain's call for the universality of human rights and Cassin's insistence on their indivisibility, the Cold War rivalry between the two blocks and the admission of the newly independent states in the UN, ended with the adoption of two covenants in 1966 on civil and political rights, on the one hand, and, economic and social rights, on the other hand. However, despite the tireless struggles of three generations of individuals and institutions, and the impact of globalisation on human rights, the Universal Declaration is considered as a lantern of hope viewed from afar by political prisoners and refugees around the world. And yet, the philosophy of human rights continues to propel humanity into the future, where many still believe that justice, rights and peace can be constructed. Therefore, if the lessons of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights are not learned, and if we do not consider the past 70 years, which separate us from the foundation of this monumental document as a positive journey; the future generations will have great difficulties in overcoming the challenges of the next 70 years."

Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson <JNJ.N>, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognise no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury.

Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognised carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognised as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognised in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognised the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centred primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centrepiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favourable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavourable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognised as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favourable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognise the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""

On 6 September, a five-member Bench of the Supreme Court ruled that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), insofar as it applied to consenting adults, violated India's constitutional morality. The landmark judgement not only affected the lives of millions of LGBTQ+ people, but also reversed an earlier ruling that had criminalized the community only five winters ago. It was on 11 December 2013 when two judges of the apex court had decided that India's LGBTQ+ community was a ""minuscule minority"" and reinstated the IPC section (which had been repealed by an earlier Delhi high court ruling in 2009), effectively turning LGBTQ+ people into ""criminals"".

As Justice Indu Malhotra, one of the five judges who read out four concurrent verdicts on 6 September, said, society owes the LGBTQ+ community an apology for the historical wrongs perpetrated against it.

Over the last three months, Lounge reached out to individuals across the community to understand the ways in which the change in legal status has affected their physical, mental and professional well-being. The stories we heard ranged from individuals finally finding the conviction to come out to their families to euphoric jubilation at the prospect of living freely. Some felt better equipped to battle the daily micro-aggressions they faced at schools, colleges or work. For others, the novelty of a post-377 world quickly wore off, as social structures, inflected by class, caste, and religion, cut into their hopes of a life of dignity and equality.

Opening the door

Coming out as LGBTQ+ is never easy, even in societies that are supportive and protective of the community's rights. The process begins with accepting oneself, followed by asserting that identity to the world. Judicial reform may create an enabling platform to come out, but social realities don't necessarily change in sync. So the battle must be fought as much inside courtrooms, as inside drawing rooms, classrooms and meeting rooms, every day of our lives.

""Will someone who hasn't been able to express their sexuality for, say, 10 years, be able to overcome this 'taboo' overnight?"" asks Atri Kar, a 28-year-old school teacher in Kolkata. Kar, who came out as a transwoman in 2014, fought a legal battle against the state of West Bengal in 2017 to include third gender in application forms for all public offices and won the case. ""When I began sex reassignment surgery a few years ago, I already knew that if you want to have a revolution, you have to start it at your home,"" Kar adds. ""If I am unable to sensitize people I have grown up around, how will I be able to convince the rest of the world?""

Bengaluru-based LGBTQ+ activist Ayaan Syed shares the sentiment. Coming out, he admits, should not be forced by circumstances. Each individual has to find the right time to make that decision. ""But you should not put yourself in a situation like marriage for the sake of social cover-up,"" he says. ""I come from an orthodox Muslim family and they will never accept me for who I am. I knew this and even the fact that there was a threat to my life. But I still chose to come out, because I really don't care what society says about me.""

One of the most affecting stories that emerged on 6 September was of 25-year-old Arnab Nandy, a Mumbai-based tech professional who came out as gay in a Facebook post. Pictured with his mother planting a kiss on his cheek and his father beaming at the camera, Nandy is seated between his parents, who are holding up a poster saying: MY SON IS NOT A CRIMINAL ANYMORE. Nandy says he has been out since he was 23 but told his mother about his sexuality three months before the ruling. It wasn't easy to break the news to the family, more so because his father is a government employee and was worried about Section 377. ""I didn't want to come out to the entire world unless my parents were ready to fight for it,"" he adds. The post not only went viral, but some people even put it up as their WhatsApp display picture.

Having grown up in a conservative set-up, though fortunate to have supportive friends in college and colleagues in workplaces, Nandy is reluctant to dismiss anyone as a homophobe. ""In India even menstruation is taboo, how do you expect people to be okay with gay sex?"" he says. The task of making people around us more sensitive is long-drawn, uphill, sometimes futile. But we can't give up, he says. And it must start as early as possible.

Young and sorted

Shortly after the ruling on Section 377, Arpita Das, publisher of the independent imprint Yoda Press, spoke on social media about celebrating the victory with her 13-year-old ""queer"" daughter Amalia (who shares her views with us). Das' post created ripples of praise but also ugly denunciation and accusations of bad parenting. On 8 September, Das wrote an article in The Quint, in which she addressed these responses with a clarity that makes it required reading for all parents. ""Feeling queer has nothing to do with being in a sexual relationship,"" she wrote. ""It is about understanding where you stand in terms of your preference, identity and desire.""

""The last few years of activism around LGBTQ+ issues has given 13-14-year-olds a narrative that they can join,"" says Nupur Dhingra Paiva, a Delhi-based clinical psychologist who works mostly with young people. Until recently, the binary of being identified as a boy or a girl was the only one available to children. But no more.

One of Dhingra Paiva's youngest clients, a four-year-old, refused to be called by a girl's name and came to sessions wearing different (male) superhero outfits. Another 14-year-old girl felt piqued because ""today was not a girl day"" -- but she did not want to become a boy either. ""The real struggle for the parents is to stay with this feeling of in-between-ness,"" says Dhingra Paiva.

Another clinical psychologist, Mumbai-based Sonali Gupta, adds, ""Any judgement has value if you build resilience into the system. You build this with children and larger institutions like schools."" While most schools in India (even in the urban centres) have a long way to go before sex education becomes part of their curricula, parents and families can start the conversation early. ""I told my daughter about LGBTQ+ identities when she was 4 (she is 9 now),"" says Gupta. ""I introduced her to the concept using a book called And Tango Makes Three.""

Ground realities

The struggle to sustain the momentum of the reading down of Section 377 must begin at the grass-roots. While Syed and his associates are trying to convince local schools and colleges to let them organize workshops on gender and sexuality for young adults and millennials, other organizations are working to push through policy changes.

Chennai-based L. Ramakrishnan is the vice-president of the NGO Saathii, which works on barrier-free access to health, legal, social and educational services for communities that are marginalized on account of their HIV status and/or gender or sexual identities. He particularly relates the Section 377 ruling back to the 2014 Supreme Court verdict on third gender, also known as the Nalsa judgement. ""The disconnects between the Nalsa verdict and what the state governments understand of it, and need in order to implement it, are resoundingly large,"" he says. ""The state officials, for instance, look for government orders to be able to implement policies on the ground, and those orders don't often exist. Further, their understanding is often limited to transgender = third gender = kinnar or hijra. The notions of binary trans identities and transmasculine persons are largely foreign to them, despite their inclusion in the scope of the verdict.""

Particularly dire is the predicament of the transmen community (those who identify as male but were assigned female gender at birth). Nandini Krishnan, author of a new book, Invisible Men: Inside India's Transmasculine Networks, says, ""The language used by the judges (in the Section 377 ruling) -- saying 'the law has become a weapon of harassment', for instance -- is a crucial moral victory."" Scarcely accounted for even within the trans community, transmen may be less haunted by the fear of discovery and persecution, adds Jamal Siddiqui, a 27-year-old transman from Delhi. ""The police may finally become more aware of the transman identity,"" Siddiqui adds, describing the recent ordeal faced by an underage transman at the hands of the police in Delhi, who had no idea that such an identity even existed, in spite of the (now nearly-five-year-old) Nalsa judgement.

Ramakrishnan, however, mentions one immediate change he has experienced in his work post-Section 377. ""A person from a state branch of the national health mission approached us to help modify the mental health policy of that state and include LGBTQ+ people under it,"" he says. The idea may take time to gestate and realize, but it is a beginning nonetheless.

When I moved to Canada in 2016, my life from the point of view of my sexual orientation did not change much. Earlier I had worked in tech in Bengaluru for several years, where I was out at my workplace, and accepted as such. I was lucky to work with companies that embraced inclusivity and diversity in word and deed. For instance, when the Supreme Court ruling against the LGBTQ+ community was announced in 2013, the company I was working with at the time sent out an email to all its employees saying it stood behind the rights of the community.

But it was only in Canada, though, that I realized the political freedoms I had. I could, for instance, kiss a guy on the street without thinking in terms of ""being caught"". Now that IPC Section 377 is gone, will it allow for more free expression of love on the streets of India? I don't think so. Culturally sanctioned norms of behaviour are not going to go away simply because there is a legal change now.

I have been out to my parents for the past eight years and they have come to accept it. I never felt in any way that their affection towards me was compromised. So, on the day Section 377 was struck down, I was expecting some form of response from them. My mother did call me up, and I could tell she wanted to talk about it, but all she could bring herself to say was something like, ""So the ruling happened"".

As her reaction was rather diluted, I explained to her that it was a pretty big deal, and that it could change millions of lives. She eventually did admit that even after all this time, she didn't know how to talk about the subject and highlighted that this discomfort stems from a general discomfort around topics related to sex. Interestingly, a few years ago, she had pushed through the discomfort to talk to me about the importance of safe sex. My father was very awkward and didn't even mention it.

When I lived in India, I would have probably at worst faced ostracization, hopefully not physical harm. I was protected by my education, class and caste privileges as well as the circle of friends I have. I do want to come back to India to live there one day, and the ruling sort of makes it slightly more okay for me to do so. But my desire to claim my identity is strong. And for that to be realized, more changes need to happen in other spheres and become integrated with the day-to-day politics of life.

Even when I was studying in class X, I knew I was different. I felt female and ""feminine"" but I didn't feel accepted or even understood. It is only much later when I got intimate with someone that I felt sexually accepted. Eventually, I accepted myself too.

My family is originally from Odisha, and that's where I grew up as well. I always wanted to join fashion designing, and I cleared the entrance exam for the National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) with top marks. I could have gone to Bengaluru, but I realized I wouldn't be able to afford the city. I chose Raipur instead.

Here, I found a community that has been a great support system. I fiddled with the idea of a sex reassignment surgery (SRS), but I wasn't convinced it would be safe. My sisters in the community call me Siddhi. I wanted to look like the woman I felt I was. In Raipur, the transgender community is mostly hijras. They resort to begging, and some of them even to prostitution, to make a living. They have the guru system, and undergo a nirvaan (castration). There is a lot of superstition around the idea of SRS in this community, and they vehemently oppose it. (The rudimentary castration) makes them all the more vulnerable to a lot of health issues and even fatal diseases. Besides, will they even feel sexually satisfied? Chhattisgarh is not the kind of place where the conversation on SRS and the rights of the LGBTQ+ community happens as it does in other places. Still, through a lot of counselling, we have been able to make the hijra community more open to SRS.

What the 377 verdict has done is ensure that this is a safer process and gives me the legitimacy to look ahead. I am already undergoing a hormone replacement therapy, and have undergone a lot of counselling to prepare myself for SRS next year. The verdict gave me the confidence that I can choose a good surgeon in a reputed hospital, and ensure that I won't be asked a lot of demeaning questions. I am looking to have a vaginoplasty procedure next year, but preferably in a metro like Delhi. The 377 verdict states, ""Transgender persons' right to decide their self-identified gender is also upheld and the Centre and state governments are directed to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender."" It means I can be whatever I want to be.

I am usually a late riser, but on 6 September I woke up around 5.30-6am and immediately started looking for updates on social media. Finally, around midday, the news came, and the first person I called was my girlfriend, who is in the Netherlands. It was quite early there and she was barely awake. But in no time we were squealing with joy. Earlier I wouldn't have wanted my girlfriend to live with me in India, because where she is from, same-sex marriage is legal. But after the ruling I feel we could well be together here.

The reading down of Section 377 showed the community that we, as a people, are moving in the right direction. But it's just the beginning. Hate crimes against the community have not gone away because the law has changed. It's as though there is a perception that we, members of the LGBTQ+ community, are antigens. We must be dangerous to the social fabric. As an artist I'm inspired to work even harder to bring about a change in this mindset, to channel my anger into my art.

A lot of conservative Indian families consider our kind of love radical. But there are people -- including children from conservative families -- who have reached out to me since I came out on national TV on India's Got Talent (IGT). They say my courage on stage has given them hope.

Before Section 377 was removed, I went for an audition in a reality show and was rejected because I came out there. My intention was to provide a face in the entertainment industry that young lesbian women could relate to. I wanted to show that I am a millennial who is proud of her sexuality and also wants to win people over with her music. There is nothing to be ashamed of. When I went to IGT after Section 377 was gone, there was a clear difference in the way I was encouraged to talk about my sexuality.

I live in Begum Vihar with my parents and two older brothers. I belong to a Hindu family -- farmer's caste. My father runs a small store near our home. My parents don't know what the words ""gay"" or ""transgender"" mean, nor do they know that such identities exist. So they won't understand who I am or the kind of people I might love in the future.

I was in the hospital, accompanying a friend for a minor check-up, when I heard about the Section 377 ruling. Unlike my parents, my brother, who is two years older than me, knows that I occasionally dress up like a woman. He is possibly the only one in my family who knows exactly who I am -- you know, meetha, gudd, chakka, names that I've been called all my life. He got really angry about the ruling. In fact, recently he told my mother to check my bag for lipstick and eyeliner. And she did. She was really surprised and a bit embarrassed to find a lipstick and ""pancake"" in my bag. I lied, saying those belonged to a friend from college. She confiscated them and said, ""Either you 'fix' yourself, or I will kill myself.""

Since childhood, my mannerisms have been too ""feminine"". I stand a particular way; I walk with a sway in my hips. My mother always felt there was something ""wrong"" with me, so she once took me to a local doctor who promised that he would be able to ""cure"" me. I went there for a month, but I think he eventually gave up. Of course, he did -- he was a fake doctor anyway. All he said was that I couldn't be helped and advised my mother to ensure that I hung out with the ""right"" people.

In places like where I live, it will take decades before any crucial change comes about, even after the Section 377 ruling. The ruling seems very superficial anyway, because nothing has changed in my life or my friends' lives. The other day, a friend was waiting at a traffic signal and a policeman yelled from behind, ""Now your kind will have the freedom to s**k and f**k men publicly, legally!"" This is what people think of us and the Section 377 ruling. So what change are you talking about?

I wish I was born a girl. When I go to LGBTQ+ parties with my friends, I wear the most beautiful dresses and look gorgeous when I put on make-up. Maybe in future, I will have the courage to undergo a sex-change operation, but that will only happen when I get a high-paying job and live independently (as my family will banish me for sure). There still aren't such jobs for people from my community -- so all this just seems like an impossible dream for now.

I found out what the word ""gay"" meant when I was eight years old. Around that time, I asked my mother some questions about it and she mentioned Section 377 in that context. Even at that age, I thought the law was dumb. Eventually, I got older and realized I was part of this community myself.

Over the last few years, my initial annoyance with this weird law turned into anger. So many people I knew -- not just my LGBTQ+ friends -- felt put down by it. I always felt that the law affected a certain group of people, of which I am a part.

The good part is I am really lucky to go to a school with a student body that doesn't really care about how you identify -- which is truly great. I can loudly talk about how I like my girlfriend, for instance, and no one would mind. But, of course, some teachers are still conservative.

Earlier I would imagine that whenever Section 377 would go, it would feel different, and in a way it did feel so when I first found out about the ruling. I felt a surge of intense pride and happiness when I heard about it. The first thing I did when I got home from school that day was hug my mother and scream out the news to my friends, but after the first flush of excitement was over, I thought, ""Okay, so what's the next goal for us?""

I would like to do something for the community, even if it is something small. I want other people like me, those who are close to my age or not, to know that they are not alone -- even if they lose family or friends over it. They still can find other people in the world if they look far enough. There will always be people who will accept them for who they are.

At school, I was bullied for not adhering to the gender assigned to me by society. My classmates, though not all, made me feel miserable and my only escape was literature. If school was a living hell as my gender was at stake, college was a place where people speculated about my sexuality. As I was a supporter of homosexuality, some people, whom I regarded as ""close friends"", spread silly rumours about me. I didn't have the courage to argue in favour of homosexual behaviour as it was a crime then, neither did I know much about queer theory. My experiences in school and college compelled me to take up urban space, gender and sexuality as my research interests. Queer safe space plays a significant role in our lives. I consider myself fortunate to have got such a space in Guwahati.

The Supreme Court verdict was a kind of second independence for us in the LGBTQ+ community. As soon as it was announced, I called up my friends and congratulated them. I also called up a friend who is in the closet and trapped in marriage. I hope he will come out soon and take the right decisions now.

If the Supreme Court had passed the ruling when I was a kid, I would not have faced the humiliation I did. I have been more vocal about homosexuality since the judgement. I have got the courage to talk about homosexuality with people who have little knowledge of it. Our struggle does not end here. Awareness programmes about gender and sexuality should be conducted at schools and colleges in towns and villages. For if people still live in the closet and become victims of failed marriages, all efforts to create a fairer, more inclusive, society will be in vain."
