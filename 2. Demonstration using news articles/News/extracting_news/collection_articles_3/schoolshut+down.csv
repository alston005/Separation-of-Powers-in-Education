Teen Kills School Mate Because He Wanted To See The School Shut Down","indiatimes.com",FALSE,"Teens go through a lot of transformation in their lives, making them more prone to being angry, depressed and anxious. If not given enough attention this can have dire consequences like death too.

14-year-old Dev Tadvi, was hacked to death in a bathroom at Bharti School in Vadodara's Wadi area. On Friday, Dev became an unfortunate victim to the design of the 16-year-old accused who wanted to disgrace the school. The accused wanted to disgrace his school for being reprimanded by a teacher. The accused wanted to see if the school closed when he killed Tadvi, who he met a couple of minutes before, in the bathroom of Bharti School. The accused revealed this to police after he was held from Valsad on Friday night.

The boy, who was at his aunt's house in Valsad, told police he was agitated as a teacher had scolded him for not doing his homework two days before he committed the crime.

Officials say that he felt insulted and wanted to get the school closed. He then planned to kill someone in the school so it would be forced to shut down. According to the police, the boy's planning was almost foolproof and that if two schoolboys hadn't been in the washroom and seen him commit the crime, the killer would not have been identified. The boy even removed his shirt before stabbing Tadvi so it wouldn't get stained.

After stabbing Tadvi, the accused fled to his aunt's house and changed his clothes. When his father came to know of the incident, he boarded a bus with his son and reached Valsad.

However, by the time they reached Valsad, the two boys who were witness to the crime, revealed the killers identity. The accused were nabbed once they reached Valsad with the help of local police there. ""Tadvi collapsed after the first stab, but the perpetrator repeatedly stabbed Tadvi in his neck,"" said ACP S G Patil."

The 14-year-old boy was found dead with ten stab wounds on his body on Friday, Deputy Police Commissioner RS Bhagora said.

The 17-year-old accused, a student of the same school located in the city's Baranpora area, was caught in Valsad town in South Gujarat, Vadodara Police Commissioner Manoj Sashidhar told PTI. He became a suspect in the case after officials spotted him on CCTV camera footage entering the washroom along with the victim, the police said.

The Class 10 student, according to the Hindustan Times, has confessed to the murder and told the police that he had planned it to force the school to close as revenge for teachers scolding him. Sashidhar was quoted as saying in the report that the accused had no animosity towards the victim but had displayed behavioural problems in the past and was scolded by his teachers.

Jagruti Pandya, chairperson of the Gujarat State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, said the mental condition of the accused will be examined.

Earlier, Bhagora had said that the murder could have been the result of a fight between the two children.

The victim had joined the school only a week before he was killed and had been staying with his maternal uncle. His parents live in Gujarat's Anand town, the police said.

The Vadodara case is eerily similar to the murder of a seven-year-old student in Gurugram's Ryan International School in September last year. The Class 2 student was found in a pool of blood, with his throat slit, in the school's washroom on 8 September. An inquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation had found that a Class 11 student had killed the child to have the school shut down and a parent-teacher meeting and exam postponed.

The bad news, according to a section of former students and teachers, is that the management is planning to shut it down owing to poor strength. The issue was discussed on Sunday as the students of the 1994 batch gathered to felicitate their teachers.

The school management, however, denied the reports and said they were looking to improve the school's condition.

Set up in 1919 as an elementary school, it was upgraded to a middle school in 1927 and a high school in 1947. This government-aided school was once the choice of many from Town Hall, Ukkadam and Sungam areas.

Recalling the good old days, P Muthamilan, 62, a former Tamil teacher of the school, said the school had around 650 students at its peak. ""Lots of SC/ST students and children of sanitary workers who studied in the school have later made their mark in various fields,"" he said. ""Though the pass percentage was around 47% before i joined the school, after principal Philomin Maria Joseph took over, it rose drastically due to his efforts. In 1993 and 1994, the school saw 100% results,"" Muthamilan added.

Former teachers of the school said the management had stopped admission to Class VI four years ago and made the students, who cleared Class V, join a matriculation school nearby, a sister concern of the management. ""The management systematically closed admissions to Class VI and made the students join the matriculation school. That's why the student strength has come down,"" said a former teacher.

When contacted, Fr Andrew, correspondent of the school, said the management had not decided to close down the school. ""We have not stopped admissions either. But parents don't prefer the school as it doesn't have Class XI & XII,"" he said. Pointing out that the school teachers were on evaluation duty, he said, ""Once they come back, we will discuss ways to improve the school.""

Former students said in their days the school was the most sought-after in the area. ""There was hardly any vacant seat in the school,"" said K Mahendran, 39, who completed Class X from the school in 1994. ""Now, it is sad hear that the school is about to be closed down for want of student strength,"" he said."

Parents of 11 children, studying in a private school under the Economically Weaker Section/ Disadvantaged Group (EWS/DG) category in north Delhi, have been running pillar to post for the past few days. The reason: the school has asked them to seek admission elsewhere as it was shutting down.

The children were studying at Sant Parmanand Public School, Majlis Park, in north Delhi. The school is recognised by the Directorate of Education (DoE) and runs up to Class VIII.

School principal, Anita, said the school administration had informed all children that it would close in February. However, parents claimed that they were informed verbally about the decision only on March 31.

""The school building is old and we are shutting it for renovation. We had informed the children in February. The other (general category) students have been admitted to the two-three schools nearby. We had also informed the education department about the children under the 25% reserved category,"" said Anita. She did not reply whether the decision had been communicated in writing.

Section 46 of the The Delhi School Education Rules, 1973, states that no managing committee shall close down a recognised school, not being an unaided minority school, or an existing class in such school, without giving full justification and without prior approval of the director, who shall, before giving such an approval, consult the Advisory Board.

According to education department officials, the school, which has about 100 students, had applied for closure and has not conducted admissions this year. An inspection of the school was carried out but a final decision on closure is ye to be taken.

DoE Director Saumya Gupta said many schools submit applications, but it takes time for them to reach the headquarters. ""The application reaches the district office, and then me. I will have to check about this school,"" she said.

Parents, meanwhile, are clueless about the future of their children. They said they tried to meet Education Minister Manish Sisodia and other education department officials, claiming that the children have been home for almost two weeks. ""No notice was given to us. Had they informed us earlier, we would have applied to other schools. But now the new academic session has started. Why did they not put up the information on the notice board?"" said Pradeep Kumar, whose son is in Class I.
