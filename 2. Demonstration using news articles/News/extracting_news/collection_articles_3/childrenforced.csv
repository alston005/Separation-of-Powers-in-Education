According to the study, children in the age group of 3-6 travel a distance of 3-5 km to avail ICDS services.

The distance to ICDS for 13% children is more than 20 km and for 17% children the distance is 6-10 km.

""The poor and marginalised palmyra labourers are landless. They migrate to palmgroves with the children. Of the 396 migrant settlements covered in the study, 88% of the families migrated with children,"" said A.R. Muniyasamy, president of State Palmyrah Workers and Handicrafts Society.

The labourers are forced to sell the produce to particular merchants who lend money in advance.

The government has not been able to provide water supply, PDS services, public health services, neighbourhood schools and public transport facilities in migrant settlements. Almost half the year, the families spend their lives in palmyra groves without access to any basic services.

""It is extremely unacceptable that a generation of children continue to live and work in inhuman conditions,"" said Mr. Muniyasamy.

""There are various national and international laws and policies recognising the rights of children, but those are meaningless in the lives of palmyra tapping families,"" said Mr. Muniyasamy.

Participants at the meeting stressed on the need for initiatives on bridge schools in the palmyra groves during the migrant season to prevent children from dropping out of school."

Five BJP supporters -- Krishna Sardar, Shyam Babu Roy, Sanjay Goldar, Gopal Mahato and Rana Saha -- were arrested on Thursday for targeting a school bus, belonging to DPS Megacity, near B T College in the city's northeastern suburbs on Wednesday. The BJP workers, according to police, were ""trying to enforce the bandh"".

Now, in a turn of events that no one had foreseen, children from these families find themselves in a sticky situation for no fault of their own. No one has been able to attend school for a variety of reasons and all of them are now worried that they may not be able to return to school at all.

""My mother has been making the rounds of the court and the police station since my father's arrest and I have been staying at home. Some of my friends have told me that my name may be struck off the school register as my father has been arrested in a criminal case,"" the son of one of the five arrested BJP supporters, a student of Class IV in a local school, said.

'How could my son target schoolchildren?'

The situation is the same at the home of a 19-year-old youth, who was the first to be arrested. ""My mother and grandmother spent Thursday at court and spent most of Friday at the police station to see my uncle. So there is no one to take me to school,"" the Class-II student told TOI, playing in the courtyard of a ghetto in Ganganagar.

All five arrested stay in the same neighbourhood, which is known as a ""BJPsupporting neighbourhood"". Many young supporters of the party fled their home on Thursday, fearing arrest, as news of the police action spread.

My uncle is the head of the family,"" a Class XII student, niece of one of the arrested, said on Friday. ""We are now looking after the household while our parents are trying to get my uncle out of jail. I don't know whether we will be able to resume school any time soon,"" the elder of the two sisters said while cooking on the verandah of their home.

But all the families said the attack on aschool bus was ""reprehensible and shameful"". ""I support the BJP,"" Krishna Sardar's mom, Anima Sardar, said. ""But the BJP bandh was to protest against the death of two students. How could my son and other BJP supporters target schoolkids? It is shameful and they should have never done so,"" she said. Others in the neighbourhood, too, criticised the attack but said the attack was by ""outsiders"".

""We are questioning four of the five, who are in police custody,"" a senior Bidhannagar Commissionerate officer said."

Meantime, Associated Press reports of the immense hunger among the Yemeni civilians. Many Yemeni families have nothing to eat but leaves as a humanitarian crisis reaches a critical stage.

Journalists of the agency visited Aslam district situated in Yemen's north-western Hajjah province where they witnessed the worsening hunger. Families with starving children have nothing to eat but the leaves of local vine, known as Halas in Arabic or Arabian Waz Leaf in English, boiled into a sour and made acidic green paste.

The agency reports that the main health centre was flooded with dozens of emaciated children. It said, ""Excruciatingly thin toddlers, eyes bulging, sat in a plastic washtub used in a make-shift scale as nurses weighed each one. Their papery skin was stretched tight over pencil-like limbs and knobby knees. Nurses measured their forearms, just a few centimetres in diameter, marking the worst stages of malnutrition"".

Aslam district recorded one of Hajjah's highest jumps in the number of malnourished children, from 384 cases being treated in January- an additional 1,319 more came in over the next six months.

Adding to the woes for the victims of Saudi-led coalition, Aslam's main health centre has no paediatricians, electricity, oxygen cylinders and fuel for generators.

Saleh al-Faqih, a worker in a mobile Health Ministry clinic has told that ""Aslam is just another picture of Somalia.""

A malnourished mother in al-Mashrada village, having a seven-month old girl in her lap said, ""Since the day she was born, I have not had the money to buy her milk or buy her medicine."" The mother feeds her whole family with Halas mush.

In January this year, London based The Guardian reported that war in Yemen has killed or injured more than 5000mchildren and left another four lakh severely malnourished and fighting for their lives.

UNICEF report unveiled that nearly 2 million Yemeni children were out of school, a quarter of them since the conflict escalated with Saudi-led coalition intervention in March 2015.

The raid was prompted by complaints the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) in Chaibasa received from parents in Jharkhand who suspected their children of being trafficked.

A preliminary investigation into the matter revealed that the Paksin Mary Cross Child Shelter Home in Phullanwal was operating without it being registered under the Juvenile Justice Act. This led law enforcement agencies to arrest the shelter home's owner, 58-year-old Satyendra Prakash Musa. Police have also seized records from the home that is in its twelfth running year.

Musa is currently being interrogated for information about 30 children who were reportedly inmates at the shelter home but were not found by police at the time of the raids. Records accessed by the police suggest that 38 children sourced from Bihar and Jharkhand were living at the shelter home in question when it was raided on August 20. However, only eight were rescued from the shelter home before it was raided and the rescued inmates shifted to another care home in Doraha.

The child trafficking cell of Jharkhand police has arrested Musa on charges of illegal human trafficking. He has also been charged with sections corresponding to forced illegal conversion after probing authorities suspected him of forcibly converting the children under his care to Christianity and giving them Christian names. The children were also being taught Christian texts at the home in Phullanwal, Sub-Inspector Banarasi Ram told The Indian Express.

A complaint against Musa has been registered at the Chaibasa Sadar police station under Section 42 of the Juvenile Justice Act, Section 5 of the Immoral Traffic Prevention Act, Section 4 of the Jharkhand Religious Freedom Act 2017 and Section 370 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) that corresponds to charges of human trafficking.

During the course of the interrogation, the accused told officials that he had handed over the missing children to their parents in Bihar and Jharkhand. However, in the absence of any evidence to support his claim, police officials are racing against time to verify his statements."

To make matters worse, the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) inspection team, led by chairperson Swati Maliwal, found that at one centre, a lone cook caters to the hunger pangs of the girls, who are often made to cook for themselves.

The case may be no different in the 13 NGOs in the city which maintain open shelter homes for children. Most of them complain of paucity of funds. Each home, which houses 25 children, has an annual budget of Rs 19,99,200 released by the WCD Ministry. An additional Rs 5 lakh is granted to the non-profit organisations once in five years for nonrecurring expenses, as per an RTI reply provided to the Centre for Holistic Development. However, Maliwal said that insufficient budget cannot be an excuse for the erratic running of the homes as most of them get donations from external sources.

""The budget which comes from the ministry is not sufficient to run an open shelter homes. Which qualified person would work for a mere Rs 8,000 per month as staff? It's impossible for an organisation to maintain homes solely depending on government funds. The funds are also released to us once an annual budget is invested completely,"" an NGO coordinator said.

In their annual budgets, child care institutions receive a monthly grant of Rs 2,000 per child. The staff salary is distributed per month is as following: Rs 17,500 for a project coordinator, Rs 14,000 for a social worker, Rs 9,000 each to both care givers, Rs 8,000 each to three outreach workers and Rs 6,000 each to a cleaner and cook. To meet any further expenses, the organisations rely on donations.

""The financial support is provided for 25 children utilising the services at night as well. During the day, there would be more children utilising services for intermittent periods. For children availing services only during the day, a monthly maintenance of Rs 1,000 per child is provided. Apart from above, the NGOs are encouraged to enrol support of volunteers and raise funds from other sources to run the open shelters,"" the RTI reply stated.

A social activist, however, hinted on the misuse of government funds by NGOs and urged the ministry to conduct a strict scrutiny of utilisation of funds.

Psychologists stress on the need for love and warmth for the holistic development of the children. ""It is essential that warmth, love and sense of belonging are provided to the children staying in shelter homes. If, for some reason, they are forced to engage in regular chores then a feeling of helplessness takes over them,"" said Aarti, a psychologist at Shri Ganga Ram Hospital."

Against a notable silence on the part of many Republicans, the Democratic lawmakers on Sunday visited a detention centre outside New York City and headed to Texas to inspect facilities where children have been detained, reported The Washington Post.

In McAllen, Texas, where several Democratic lawmakers toured a facility, state representative Vicente Gonzalez estimated that he saw about 100 children younger than six. ""It was orderly, but it was far from what I would call humane,"" he said.

Seven Democratic members of Congress spent Sunday morning at the Elizabeth Contract Detention Facility in New Jersey, waiting for nearly 90 minutes to view the facilities and visit five detained immigrants.

""This is unfair and unconstitutional,"" said New York representative Adriano Espaillat.

Trump has falsely blamed the separations on a law he said was written by Democrats, The Washington Post reported. But the separations instead largely stem from a ""zero-tolerance"" policy announced last month by Attorney General.

The White House has also interpreted a 1997 legal agreement and a 2008 bipartisan human trafficking bill as requiring the separation of families, a posture not taken by the previous two administrations.

Trump remained silent on the issue before tweeting on Sunday evening that Democrats should work with Republicans on an immigration solution before the midterm elections ""because you are going to lose!""

US officials have said that the number of families who could be broken up might double and that the number of children who have already been taken from their parents -- 2,000 over a six-week period from April to May -- may be higher than what the administration has reported.

Today, on World Day Against Child Labour, while we adults sit in our air-conditioned offices and crib about our paychecks, some 152 million children between the ages of five and 17 are being forced into labour under unspeakable conditions.

There are more horrifying statistics where that comes from, with International Labour Organization (ILO). The ILO, which launched World Day Against Child Labour in 2002 to grab global attention to the terrifying figures of child labour, shared some of these figures in their World Day Against Child Labour program this year.

Check out these figures by the ILO on child labour:

The horror doesn't end there...

According to 2015 National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data:

While it is not clear if the children died in these circumstances while working working here, multiple investigative reports have shown a tendency of child labour in such cases.

India's worst case of child labour-related deaths in mica mines

In 2016, an investigative report by Reuters claimed that India's illegal mica mines had covered up the deaths of at least seven children killed in just two months.

""Investigations over three months in the major mica producing states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh found child labor rife, with small hands ideal to pick and sort the valued mineral that puts the sparkle in cosmetics and car paint,"" said the report.

""Interviews with workers and local communities discovered children were not only risking their health in abandoned 'ghost' mines off official radars, but they were dying in the unregulated, crumbling mines, with seven killed since June.""

ILO's agenda

""Children are more vulnerable to risk than adults. Urgent action is needed to ensure no child under the age of 18 is in hazardous child labour,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.

On this World Day Against Child Labour, a joint campaign has been launched with World Day for Safety and Health at Work (SafeDay) to improve the safety and health of young workers and end child labour.

The campaign also aims to ""accelerate action to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 8.8 of safe and secure working environments for all workers by 2030 and SDG target 8.7 of ending all forms of child labour by 2025,"".

Her parents are migrant agricultural labourers, who spend October to March each year traveling between villages in western Maharashtra and Karnataka cutting sugarcane.

""Now, I've decided not to leave the village till I give my class X board exams,"" she says. Her school teacher had called her parents twice to get her to sit for the year-end exams, but she couldn't make it. ""The teacher will make someone else write my paper and will promote me to the next class,"" she says. She says she can't comprehend written Marathi because of missing regular classes.

""I couldn't leave my daughter alone in the village where you can't even see a dog for six months,"" says her mother, Sapna Jadhav, who is in her early 30s. Sapna's son Rohan, 9, and daughter Mohini, 4, also travel with them.

""There's a lot of anguish, but what can be done about it?"" she asks. Her parent also work as agricultural labourers in Beed taluk and are away from the village the entire day. ""It was not possible for me to leave behind my children,"" says Jadhav.

Sapna and Damini also talk about the lack of proper healthcare facilities for the migrants. Sapna says, ""The smoke caused while preparing food leads to continuous coughing."" Sanket Jain/101 Reporters

Every morning she leaves for the fields at 9 and returns only by 9 at night. Damini, who's in grade VIII, prepares food for the family and takes it to the fields. ""When I came here I brought my school bag, but my dad took it back to the village two months ago when he had to return to the village for medical treatment,"" she says.

Dahiphal, with a population of 758, has a primary school [till grade IV]. The nearest secondary school is in Nalwandi village 3 km away and Damini walks the distance to and fro every day. ""In the evening, it's not safe to walk so my dad promised to buy me a cycle once he has enough money,"" says Damini.

Her father took an advance payment of Rs 50,000 from the contractor and is afraid that they won't be able to cut enough sugarcane to repay it. For every ton of sugarcane, they are paid Rs 248.

Ten families from Dahiphal stay in rickety sheds in an open field on the outskirts of Shirdhon village in Maharashtra's Kolhapur district. In the harsh summer, Damini stays back with her siblings and a few other children. ""I look after younger children. At times, I also go to the sugarcane fields. There is no one here to help me with my studies,"" she says.

Access to the sakhar shala (or sugar-factory school for migrants' children) is a problem as the nearest factory is 14 km away. Moreover, every few weeks the families have to move with the sugarcane harvest. In the six-months season, the Dahiphal families have migrated to Karadaga and Galatga in Karnataka, and Hupri, Shirol, Pattan Kodoli and Shirdhon villages in Maharashtra.

According to the 2011 census, 51 million people in India migrated for economic reasons. The National Sample Survey says 55.4 percent of rural migrants are illiterate. Over 48,000 students in Maharashtra were out of school, reports the 2017-18 state economic survey.

Manisha Sonawane, 35, from Kesapuri village in Manjlegaon taluk of Beed district has been migrating for more than a decade. Two years ago, Manisha's husband Anil worked as a watchman at a construction site in Pune. They were unable to support themselves on the Rs. 7,000 pay and they decided to cut sugarcane. ""In Pune, the school ma'am used to take my eight year old son, Shubham to the school daily. I can't keep him back in the village,"" says Manisha.

Shubham who is in class II wants to go back to the school. His 13-year-old brother and 11-year-old sister stay with their maternal grandmother in Devgaon village of Wadwani taluka in Beed. ""They had to stay with my mother because we keep migrating for six months a year. We can't afford to bring them with us at the cost of their education,"" says Manisha.

Every day the couple manages to cut three tonnes of cane. ""Today, I am suffering from acidity, but I can't stop working because we took an advance payment of Rs. 80,000,"" she says. Manisha, who was married at 14, has never seen the inside of a school. She believes that education can break the cycle of poverty and migration. ""I will educate all my children so that they never have to cut sugarcane,"" she vows.

Sania Tadvi, 13, is in grade VIII and belongs to the Tadvi Bhil tribe. Her day is no different from other migrant children. She collects fuel for the fire, cleans utensils, stores water and takes care of her siblings and cousins. ""By the time we return to the village, the summer break will start."" Her uncle teaches her when he gets time in the summer holidays. Sania says that it becomes difficult for them to catch up with their classmates, and that breeds a feeling of inferiority and insecurity.

She's one of 18 children from nine families who have migrated 570 kilometre with their parents from Godri village in Jamner block of Maharashtra's Jalgaon district to Kolhapur's Nandani village. Sania's mother, Roomshad, who is in her early 30s, couldn't study beyond grade IX once married. Her 15-year-old daughter Naina, who is in grade IX stays with her aunt in Godri.

Sania's father, Pintu Tadvi, never went to the school. ""My parents couldn't afford to enroll me in a school. I've been working as an agricultural labourer from my childhood days,"" he says.

""I want to fulfill my father's dream of becoming a collector,"" smiles Sania.

The basic facts are these: On 8 March, 10 students of the Kamala Girls School said they were forced to sign a ""confession letter"" admitting they were lesbians. The angry parents claimed the girls were arm-twisted into signing the letter. They said that if two persons hold hands or put their arms around each other, it does not mean they are lesbians. The acting headmistress Sikha Sarkar said some students had complained about other students engaging in ""such behaviour"". So she called them in and considering ""the sensitive nature of the issue"", she asked them to admit it in writing and then called in their guardians to discuss the matter, ""so we can bring these girls on the right course"".

Whatever might have been demonstrated in this whole sorry episode, it's certainly not sensitivity. ""Sadly our teachers are being trained to teach different subjects,"" says Paro Anand, award-winning author of books for young adults. ""But they are not taught to handle issues that confront young people.""

Stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory. Representational image from Reuters

First off, why does anyone have to ""confess"", and that too in writing, to being a lesbian? In an official statement, the Indian Psychiatric Society has declared there is ""no evidence to substantiate the belief that homosexuality is a mental illness or a disease."" ""Are students in co-ed schools asked to write a confession about their heterosexuality when they are seen spending time together?"" wonders Malobika, co-founder of Sappho for Equality -- The Activist Forum for Lesbian, Bisexual Woman and Transman Rights, in a report by Indian Express.

And what is the ""right course"" anyway? It's one thing for a school not to promote homosexuality, or even approve of it, it's another thing to extract letters of confession.

The parents are right in saying two girls holding hands does not mean they are lesbians. But even if they are, does it mean the school can make them sign a ""confession""? ""In this kind of public name-and-shame game, what space do we leave for honesty?"" wonders Anand.

The issue is not whether some girls in Kamala Girls School are lesbians or have romantic crushes on each other, or play pranks. The issue is that schools and authorities seem to have no idea about how to deal with the sexuality of young people. ""Adolescent sexuality is a problem for schools and parents,"" says YA author Himanjali Sankar. She points to the Delhi Public School scandal from some years ago where two students recorded a sexual act which someone tried to sell on baazee.com (now acquired by eBay). ""The discourse is particularly skewed when it comes to homosexuality. One doesn't need video recordings. Just the suggestion of homosexuality is condemnation enough,"" she says.

Sankar is the author of Talking of Muskaan, a book which deals with a 15-year-old girl and homosexuality, among other things. Talking of Muskaan, along with Payal Dhar's Slightly Burnt where a teenaged girl grapples with the knowledge that her friend is gay, is one of the few YA books that deals with the subject in an Indian context. Sankar says her previous books about the Superdog Rousseau resulted in many interactions at schools. But when Talking of Muskaan came out, her publisher found that schools were reluctant to invite her. ""Some got back saying they liked the book but are afraid parents will complain if they have a session around it,"" she says.

""Through my work with over 3 lakh young people and their guardians, I have discovered that we as a people are less queasy about violence than about sex and sexualities,"" says Anand. ""So we can watch, read and witness violent acts, but an act of affection, between opposite, or worse, same-sex people, is too 'hot to handle'.""

But not wanting to talk about it can backfire, as the incident at Kamala Girls School shows. The state's education minister Partha Chatterjee says the government does not approve of the fact that the school extracted ""the statement under duress"" and has not handled the matter with maturity. But Chatterjee also tells The Quint he does not approve of inculcating the idea of lesbianism in schools because it ""can influence others"" and that this ""is not the culture of Bengal"".

Adolescent sexuality can be confusing and complicated enough, without dragging the ""culture of Bengal"" into it. Schools obviously have to maintain discipline and they are well within their rights to reprimand, rebuke and even punish students who violate their rules. But stigmatising sexuality or the suggestion of it is treading into dangerous territory.

The students say they were told to write they had put their hands in their friend's blouses and tickled them under their skirts. They were asked why they held hands. Whether minister Chatterjee or the school headmistress likes it or not, teenagers are curious about sex and sexuality. But the very idea of homosexuality lays bare an ""underlying outrage"" says Sankar. An overt exhibition of heterosexual romance could also draw rebukes, but in that case, the more likely outcome is of a student being counseled about how this is not the ""right age"" and that their studies must not suffer. But even a mention of lesbianism brings forward threats of transfer certificates and signed statements.

What is tragic is that in its effort to bring girls on the ""right course"", school authorities miss how vulnerable homosexual children are in a school. A school is a place where fitting in is all-important and a child who seems different from her peers risks bullying, or worse. They are called names, teased, and ostracised. A survey by Mental Health America says LGBT youth are four times more likely to commit suicide and two-and-half times more likely to harm themselves with each instance of verbal or physical harassment. The fact that we do not conduct such studies in India does not mean we do not face these issues.

In Talking of Muskaan, Muskaan is comfortable with her sexuality but some of those around her are not, and she attempts to kill herself. That's fiction. But in real life, by stigmatising even the suggestion of lesbianism, a school sends out a terrible message. Students will often bully a student who seems different, who seems gay. That is sad, but not unusual. It is much more disheartening when the school itself comes across as the bully.

The accused even locked in a pregnant who was rescued after an NGO got the whiff of the situation. The district administration rescued 32 labours and their 31 children from a brick kiln on February 9. They have now been given letters stating them to be a free from any bond and sent back home.

Around 22 brick kilns are located in Mewat's Punhana sub-division, where these labourers were harassed by their contractor. Around 63 people, including a few couples and their children were brought here by contractors - Ram Mohan and Rajkumar three months ago. The workers hail from Chitrakoot, Panhar and Banda districts in Uttar Pradesh Many brick kilns in Uttar Pradesh have been closed down in order to protect Taj Mahal. Such workers, have now migrated to other states in search of livelihood.

The 46 labourers were paid an advance of Rs 5,000 to 10,000 each. In due course, with their promised wages, they were to be paid between Rs 25,000 to 50,000 on the basis of the number of the bricks made by the each worker.

""Each of us has made around 50,000 to 70,000 bricks. But we were not paid for our hardwork. Whenever we spoke to manager at the brickworks, Ram Mohan would interrupt and said that we will not be paid till June,"" said Jamahir, another rescued worker.

""How can we stay in another state and not have any money for 6 to 7 months. Many times, the workers we were assaulted by Ram Mohan's men for demanding our wages. They wouldn't let us leave either and forced us to work,"" said Arjun, one of the rescued labourer.

Not just financially, the brickworks didn't offer any basic facility like drinking water or washroom either. Situation got worse when he started harassing the women too, including a pregnant woman. The workers alleged that the contractor even harassed their wives and daughters.

""The woman was pregnant but he wouldn't even allow to go out even to see a doctor. Ram Mohan was worried that she would tell people about his misbehaviour with workers. One day he locked her in and stopped all labour from going out too,"" said Rajmani, a worker.

The matter came to light when a worker managed to contact a Delhi based NGO- Bonded Labour Liberation Front. The workers called the NGO on February 6 and informed them about the situation.

The NGO then reported the matter to district administration. It filed a complaint stating violation of Bonded Labor System (Abolition) Act, 1976,Interstate Migrant Workmen Act and juvenile justice act.

""The workers told us that accused would pass lewd comments towards the women, the children too were made to work. Basic facilities were missing there. When we asked why did you go to Mewat, the caller said 'sahib there is no work there else who wants to leave their home',"" said Swami Agnivesh, founder-president of Bonded Labour Liberation Front.

A team headed by SDM Jitender Garg along with Mewat police raided the brickworks and rescued the workers. All have now returned home.

Jitender Garg, SDM, Punhana told TOI that ""the workers didn't file any complaint against the employer or anyone else. We have initiated an action against the contractor and have taken an undertaking from him that if he ever misbehaves again, a police complaint will be filed against him""."

Principal of the school, V K Gandhi, said the students were ""forced to sit in open in discomfort, inhaling dust"".

Several students of Jagriti Public School in Kirari have been ""forced"" to study in the open.

The school has over 800 students and classes till VIII. While Class VI has been shifted to another building in the vicinity, where primary wing of the school is located, some classes are also being run from inside the rooms that were sealed.

An official from the school said, ""Some unidentified students had broken the seal, we had no other option but to shift some classes inside as they were falling sick.""

Anushree Majumder (13), a student of Class VIII, said, ""We often hurt ourselves as there are pebbles all around. There is so much noise that we cannot concentrate on our studies.""

Some teachers said that at least 10 children have not been attending school for the past four days as they have either fallen sick or their parents are not allowing them to study in the open.

Abhay Singh (15) said, ""Our parents asked us not to go but we don't have an option. The exams will start in March.""

A senior North Corporation official said that the school management had been engaged in unabated construction without getting the building layout plan approved. ""The corporation had issued them notices twice -- in last December and in January but they did not comply,"" the official said. North DMC Mayor Preety Aggarwal said she has asked the district commissioner to submit a report on the matter."
