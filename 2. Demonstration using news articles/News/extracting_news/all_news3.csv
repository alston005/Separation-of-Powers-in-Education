A class VIII student of the school sustained scald injury while cooking food for the teachers. When the villagers came to know about it, they demanded strict action against the teachers.

Following this, the BEO visited the school and suspended the headmaster along with the transfer of three other teachers.","Primary School Headmaster Suspended For Engaging Students In Personal Work - Pragativadi: Leading Odia Dailly","995921209","2018-11-16","http://pragativadi.com/primary-school-headmaster-suspended-for-engaging-students-in-personal-work/","pragativadi.com",FALSE
"3844","","Agra: Six months after the new session started, around 37% students of the basic education department are yet to receive shoes. So far, according to a rough estimate, 1.5 lakh out of 2.38 lakh students enrolled in the state's government-run primary and junior high schools are attending classes in slippers. However, official records say that shoe distribution in schools has been completed.

According to sources, a majority of the shoes that the department provided didn't fit the students. As a result, students come to schools in slippers on cold mornings. Principals have written to the Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) for replacements, but to no avail.

Last month, assistant education director (basic) Avadh Kishor Singh conducted inspections in primary schools of the district and expressed discontent over students not being provided with shoes even after much delay. He asked the BSA, Anand Prakash, to take time-bound action in the matter and submit the report to him. The BSA in turn asked 15 block education officers to send details of the students who needed replacements, but only one of the officers has responded so far.

District general secretary of the primary teachers' association, Brajesh Dixit, said, ""There are 2,086 primary schools and 872 junior high schools in the district. Nearly 50 percent students enrolled in these schools have no shoes. Due to mismanagement on part of officials, a majority of the shoes supplied to the school didn't fit and were returned for replacement. But even after much delay, the process has not been completed. The matter has been raised with officials several times. Over 1.5 lakh students continue to come to schools without proper shoes.""

BSA Anand Prakash said, ""Shoes have been supplied in all the schools. Block education officers have been directed to sort out size-related issues in a time-bound manner. Soon, inspections will be made to check availability of proper school dresses and shoes with students"".","Over 1.5 lakh primary school students have no shoes this winter - Times of India","994485117","2018-11-14","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/over-1-5-lakh-primary-school-students-have-no-shoes-this-winter/articleshow/66624694.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"3849","","A teachers' forum has sought the removal of chairperson of DSSSB, which conducted the exam for recruitment of primary teachers for Municipal Corporation of Delhi on Saturday.(AFP File/ Representative image)

The SC/ST/OBC teachers' forum in the national Capital has demanded the removal of the chairperson of the board that conducts recruitment exams for the Delhi government over a question involving a derogatory term referring to a particular community.

The Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) had allegedly included the controversial question in an exam conducted on Saturday for hiring primary teachers.

According to candidates who wrote the exam, the Hindi section of all the four sets of the question paper had a 'casteist question'. ""I was aghast to see the question. Use of such language in an exam for recruiting teachers shows the deeply entrenched casteism among people sitting in the authority,"" a candidate, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

Another candidate said that by asking such questions, the board has ""hurt the sentiments of their community"". ""We are upset over the insensitivity of the board and we demand an apology from them. It's highly irresponsible of them to use such casteist language in a teachers' recruitment exam,"" he said.

The DSSSB, however, cited 'inadvertent error' behind the incident. ""It has been brought to the notice of the DSSSB that in the recent recruitment exam for the post of MCD primary teachers, a question having casteist undertone appeared due to an inadvertent error. It is clarified that the procedure of paper setting is highly confidential and secretive in nature and the contents of the paper are not shared with the board officials. The contents of the paper are revealed for the very first time before the candidates only,"" the board said in a statement.

The members of SC/ST/OBC teachers' forum on Sunday wrote to the President, the Prime Minister, Union home minister, Delhi education minister and lieutenant governor demanding removal of DSSSB chairperson. ""We demand immediate action against the chairperson and also an assurance that such insensitivity will not be repeated in the future. Otherwise, we will launch a massive protest,"" said Hansraj Suman, a member of the forum. The forum has also called an emergency meeting on Tuesday.

He accused the board of 'deliberately' using the remark. ""The board could have used any question from the wide literature available in Hindi language. But they instead put a caste-based question in the paper. It only exposed their mentality,"" said Suman.

The board holds teachers' recruitment exam for government schools in Delhi.

Delhi SC/ST welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam also condemned the incident and demanded an explanation from the board. ""I will meet the Delhi Chief Secretary on Monday to discuss this issue. The services department is still under the L-G of Delhi, which is the governing body of DSSSB. The department has to now come clean on what made them agree to induct such a shoddy question,"" he said.

The DEEO had assured the school management of fixing this problem at the earliest.

The school management blames Municipal Corporation (MC) and Railways Department for this condition of the school, as the local passerby who go towards the railway lines have demolished a wall adjacent to school and they have made it a passage. The school got the wall repaired multiple times, but the passersby demolished the wall and made the passage again. The wall is adjacent to the entry of the school and the MC has neither removed the filth from the school nor have they developed the wall, and not even the railway is ready to develop the wall.

"3873","","KOZHIKODE: Disabilities do not dishearten those who are driven by determination. And there is no better example of this than 12-year-old Muhammed Aasim, a differently-abled boy from Velimanna in Kozhikode, who has been waging a spirited battle for the past several months to get his upper primary school upgraded to a high school for himself and several others from the region.

Though Aasim is worried that he already missed two months of school, he confidently says he will continue the legal battle till justice is done. ""I am sure I will get justice. If the school gets upgraded to a high school, it will benefit not only me, but also several students from our region,"" he said.

Aasim, who has 90 per cent disability, completed his Class 7 from the Government Upper Primary School, Velimanna. He will have to travel for 5-10 km to reach the nearest high schools in Koodathayi, Venappara and Karuvanpoyil, which would be quite difficult for the family. Aasim needs his parents' help to commute to the school and meet his basic needs. The boy's plight hit the headlines when he wrote to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last November, seeking the upgradation of his school, which is hardly 100 meters away so that he can continue his studies without hurdles. Born without hands, Aasim has trained himself to write with his feet. He has disabilities with his legs too.

After many ups and downs, Aasim's chances of continuing his schooling brightened after the High Court directed the Education Department on June 11 to ensure facilities for his higher studies within two weeks.

Aasim's father Muhammed Saeed had filed a petition in the court seeking a direction to the state government to upgrade the upper primary school to a high school and start Class 8 this year itself.

The High Court had dismissed 134 similar petitions for upgradations of schools across the state the same day. But, the government moved the High Court against the order passed by a single-judge bench. In an affidavit, the government said it would arrange a vehicle for Aasim's commute to and fro the nearest school and it was not practical to upgrade the school.

'Counter affidavit filed'

School PTA president Anwar Sadath T K said, ""A counter affidavit was filed in the court on Tuesday, pleading with the court to vacate the stay order. Aasim needs his parents' help to meet his basic needs. Aasim is the eldest among the couple's children and there are four other kids too. It is not practical for the mother to stay back with Aasim during school time. And his father has to be away for work.""

"3874","","CHENNAI: It's been more than four years since slum families moved to the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) settlements in Perumbakkam. But it's only now has the education department started constructing a much-needed primary school in one of the four spaces allotted by TNSCB at the settlements for constructing school buildings.

Until now, primary grade students were being taught in rooms inside the tenements. The government arts and science college is run in the community hall meant for the tenement residents.

These were among the findings submitted to HC in a hard-hitting report by advocate K Elango, citing examples of how the tenements meant to resettle squatters have instead thrown the residents' lives out of gear. Several students from Perumbakkam continue to travel at least two hours to schools in the city.

""The little kids study in cramped conditions due to lack of a proper school building. There is a middle school, but for high school, students have to study at Semmanchery where there are a good number of students studying already,"" said a source at Perumbakkam.

Settlements in Gudapakkam and Navallur (near Padappai) face similar issues due to lack of initiatives taken by the TNSCB in concurrence with the district administration and education department to improve schooling for resettled students. The report also highlighted lack of access to proper means of livelihood, besides sub-standard quality of houses. Almost all tenements were devoid of water supply. Access to monthly ration and healthcare too was irregular for the residents. Concerns about safety of women and girls fell on deaf ears, the report said.

An official from the Integrated Cooum River Eco-Restoration Project said several departments are collectively involved in the functioning of these tenements and a detailed report would be presented to the HC.

Initially, reports about one school -- Navalpur primary school - had come but after a probe it was found that four more schools were following the same practice in the district.

Notably, all the five schools had word 'Islamia' prefixed to their name on the sign board and the entire documentation of the schools records was done in Urdu.

On getting the information, Deoria Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) Santosh Dev Pandey visited all the primary schools in Swami Patti, Karmaha and Pokharbhinda Prasad villages of Rampur Karkhana block, and one in Haraiya village of Desahi block and got their names repainted.

""On Monday, I inspected all five schools. The correct names have been painted on all five buildings. They have been told to follow all rules and regulations,"" said Pandey.

The BSA added that the principals of all the five primary schools were taken to task and were directed to run the schools as per the laid down guidelines, rule and regulations.

""They have been told that if found flouting the rules, strict action will be taken against them,"" the BSA said.

The Shivji Park school has the highest number of students in any primary school in the district, yet it lacks amenities like toilets and drinking water.

The school has been operating from the building of Government Senior Secondary School, Kadipur for the last 13 years. ""We have been functioning from the Kadipur school building, ever since it was decided that our own school building had to be rebuilt,"" said Sattan Pal, headmaster.

""During monsoons, students are forced to sit in the open as there is no scope to accommodate them in the allotted classrooms. Many classes take place in the hallway of the school,"" added Pal.

There is only one washroom each for boys and girls. ""There are no separate toilets for teachers. We don't have cleaners in the school either, students and teachers clean the washrooms themselves,"" Pal explained. There are 22 teachers in the school. According to the rules set by the education department, there should be one teacher for every 25 students. In this school, one teacher has to teach at least 50 students, who say they are fed up with the second-hand treatment they get.

Similarly, Class 4 student Manish Singh said, ""Often, our teachers ask us to remain standing to accommodate everyone in class due to the scarcity of space.""

With their modest budget, the school does not even have a guard, and has witnessed many robberies. Around 80 plates were stolen from its kitchen; even the battery of the DTH system was stolen during summer vacation.

The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation inked an agreement with the International School of Aesthetics and Spa (ISAS), an NGO, to implement the programme which will see 1.25 lakh students studying in 380 civic schools getting a free haircut every month, he said.

""We have entered into an agreement with an NGO under which they will cut hair of primary school students for free. The programme will begin later this month or in the first week of August,"" L D Desai, Administrative Officer of AMC School Board, told PTI.

He said the consent of the students and their parents would be sought, adding that men will give haircuts to boys and women to girls.

""We have started taking written permission from them as only those who agree to it will be eligible for the free haircut. Fifty per cent of students and their parents have agreed,"" Desai informed.

He said that the primary objectives behind the move, as part of the 'Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur' (a step towards cleanliness) initiative, was to inculcate clean habits among students and also to ensure parents of students, many of whom hail from slums, save money on regular haircuts.

""Most of our school students come from the slum areas and they do not receive regular haircuts for various reasons. The minimum cost of a haircut in Ahmedabad is Rs 70 and we believe this programme will allow the parents of these students to save money,"" he said.

A barber was recently assaulted in Mehsana district's Satlasana village after he refused to pay heed to diktats from the upper caste people to not cut the hair of those belonging to the backward castes.

Desai, however, maintained that in the city and in municipal schools, no was discriminated on the basis of their castes.

Under the programme titled 'I am not afraid of English', one Junior Basic Training teacher and a Block Resource Person per block has been trained to make students learn one sentence every day (minimum 20 per month for 10 months) in each class, an official spokesperson said here today.

To start with, a booklet containing 1,000 sentences and phrases has been prepared. It contains 200 sentences per grade for all the five grades at the primary level of schooling.

This way, a student who is in class 1, will be able to learn at least 1,000 sentences till he passes primary level, a spokesperson said.

Six language labs have been established in selected Model Sanskriti schools in the state to facilitate digital learning and improve listening and speaking skills of the students.","Haryana launches initiative to make primary school students fluent in English","905584707","2018-07-14","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/haryana-launches-initiative-to-make-primary-school-students-fluent-in-english-118071400570_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE
"3883","","Is your child old enough to start reading on their own? Here are some hilarious books that will get them hooked to the reading habit!

By Arundhati Venkatesh

""Laughter is the reward that lures the most reluctant reader,"" said researcher Michele Landsberg.

Humour and children seem to go hand in hand. Here are five seriously funny chapter books for young readers:

Abhay and Nitya go hunting for monsters in their friends' rooms, but they end up finding all sorts of things instead, even a rat! The characters are full of spunk; Abhay's father with his theories on the moon landing is my favourite, and the wacky illustrations add to the fun. The book is part of the hole series published by Duckbill, a set of early chapter books with large font sizes and delightful illustrations. At around 70 pages, the books are not intimidating. Perfect for those taking their first steps in the world of chapter books.

Another of the Duckbill hOle books, this one has food, secret societies and a gang of friends. Pushkin aka Petu Pumpkin is always eating. When he starts emptying his friends' tiffin boxes, they form a secret society to save their lunches. But the magic potion is a flop and the superglue is a disaster ... Read the book to find out the rest. (Full disclosure: This is one of my books!)

There are more books in the Petu series:

Petu Pumpkin: Tooth Troubles is about shaky teeth, a football match, letters to the tooth fairy and escapades involving dogs.

Petu Pumpkin: Cheater Peter will be in bookstores in August 2018.

Charlie is five, and eats things that shouldn't be eaten, like paper and the sleeves of his shirts. And he is about to start school! An easy-breezy read featuring Charlie, his big brother Max and best friend Henry.

Moin finds a monster under his bed; one that sings silly songs, eats basket loads of bananas, and keeps making up (convenient) monster rules. In a hilarious turn of events, the monster accompanies Moin to school. Kooki's (the Principal, K.K. Kuttykrishnan) encounter with the monster and the ensuing chapter, aptly titled Kooki goes Cuckoo, had me chuckling. Be prepared for some offkey singing by your own little monsters, and don't be surprised if there are requests for banana burgers. There's a funny sequel too -- Moin the Monster Songster.

"3884","","After gutkha-paan, jeans and T-Shirt, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has banned teachers of primary schools from sporting beard and wearing slippers. The beard ban, however, will not be applicable on Muslim teachers.

The Additional Chief Secretary Basic Education Dr Prabhat Kumar said that personal appearance of teachers is one of the most important factors in inculcating habit of cleanliness and developing dressing sense among students.

""No beard and no slippers. All primary teachers will now have to come to school after proper shaving and in formal dress with shoes on. Besides personal appearance, we have set four standards for teachers - Integrity, Intelligence, Industry and Individuality. Services of any anyone disobeying these norms will be terminated with immediate effect, "" warned Dr Kumar.

There area about 1.67 lakh government primary schools in Uttar Pradesh with annual budget of Rs 50,142 crore for 2018-19 in comparison to 38,066 crorelast financial year, an increase of 31.7 per cent. Presiding over a meeting with Basic education department officials after taking over the charge, Dr Kumar said that to bring drastic change in the work culture, all primary schools across state will have to adopt five-point charter - Cleanliness, Politeness, Orderliness, Punctuality and Dutifulness.

""We have to compete with private schools. We are having the largest pool of teachers and students but we lag behind because no work culture was developed and followed in government primary schools. Now onwards, we have to bring in qualitative changes in primary schools by adopting newer teaching and administrative methods to run them professionally,"" said he.

Dr Kumar also directed to screen primary teachers above 50 and submit a list to him within a month for taking a decision on their VRS. He also scrapped the contractual system of hiring teachers introduced by the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government. ""Corruption in the department will not be tolerated.

"3885","","Contracts of 725 primary school teachers employed with the North Corporation have not been renewed this year because there is a surplus of employed teachers, said a government official on Wednesday.

Currently, there are 6,600 teachers in regular employment of the corporation, the official said. Total number of students enrolled in its schools as on Monday stood at 2,56,000.

According to the Right to Education Act, schools are supposed to have one teacher for every 40 students. This means, for the current number of students, 6,400 teachers are required. That is, 200 less than the total number of regular teachers employed.

'Numbers are faulty'

""The corporation's numbers are faulty,"" said Jitendra Verma, member of Samvida Shikshak Parivar Kalyan Samiti -- a contract teachers union member, who met North Corporation Mayor Adesh Gupta on Wednesday.

""About 450 teachers are getting promoted through the Trained Graduate Teacher [TGT] mode and they have sent a notification for the recruitment of 1,490 teachers through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board [DSSSB], then how can they say there is no vacancy,"" asked Kamaljit Singh, a member of the teachers union. ""Many of us have been working at these posts for the past 13-14 years. Where are we supposed to go now,"" he asked.

Expect a rise in students

By the end of August, when enrolment is typically at its highest, the corporation expects the total number of students to rise by 2,78,000.

This would take the number of required teachers to 6,950. Which means, contracts of at least about half of the teachers, finding themselves unemployed will likely be renewed.

The demand for teachers has also seen a drop because fewer students are being enrolled in corporation schools.

For instance, as of August last year, the total number of students enrolled were 2,98,000. That is, 20,000 more than the total number of students expected to enrol this year.

The North Corporation Mayor said, ""The facts being brought forward by the officials and the union are at odds and need to be examined.

"3886","","Residents demand shifting of students to nearby high school

The government primary school at Kattarampur in the heart of Karimnagar town has only one teacher and 10 students.

Though the registers show that the school has a strength of 23 students, but only less than 10 turn up everyday. During a visit on Saturday, there were only nine students, including one student each for first class and fifth class. The lone teacher, who is also headmistress of the school, conducts classes for all the students in a single room.

Incidentally, the district authorities have posted an office subordinate male (attender) to this primary school to open and close the single classroom. The authorities were planning to fill up two vacant SGT posts in the school during this present ongoing transfer and counselling programme.

The locals suggested that the government close down the primary school and shift the students into nearby Government High School in Savaran Street in the same locality. They pointed out that the government had already closed more than 127 primary schools in the erstwhile Karimnagar district which had enrolment of below 20 students as per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) survey.

Running of a school without students by paying salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff was a waste of taxpayer's money, Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district president N. Srinivas said. ""When there is no enrolment, it is better to merge the school with another school and utilize the existing resources for other public service,"" he added.

School headmistress Ramadevi said that the parents were not sending their children to the school as a road was passing through the school premises posing a threat to the students. Due to busy road, the students were confined to the classroom and there is no play and other recreational activities, she said and added that the admissions would increase into the school if there was a compound wall around the school.

Telangana Rashtra Teachers Federation (TRTF) district president M. Prathap Reddy was of the opinion that the government teachers were not meeting the expectations of the parents of the students on par with their private counterparts.

Teachers should instil confidence among the parents to ensure that they enroll in the government schools, he said.","Govt. primary school with one teacher, 10 students","897008759","2018-06-30","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/govt-primary-school-with-one-teacher-10-students/article24301144.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

The school that was started in 1992, had students from surrounding areas studying there. However, when a private school was started nearby, admissions dropped. When the current academic year started, only two students were pursuing studies.

Officials from the Department of Elementary Education were planning to close the school and admit the two students to nearby schools.

The NGO made a representation to the Department of Elementary Education, based on which a meeting was organised at the school. Villagers said that if English was introduced as medium of instruction, they would admit their children in the school.

Later, the School Management Committee (SMC) passed a resolution for starting English medium and the same was forwarded to the department. It was announced that classes would be conducted in English from the current academic year.

Following this, people campaigned in the village asking parents to admit their wards in the school.

"3888","","Both the boys' and the girls' bands, introduced a few months ago, have 12 members each.(Handout image)

At a time when most government school authorities complain of lack of resources, the principal of the primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki has formed students' music bands in his institute.

Both the boys' and the girls' bands, introduced a few months ago, have 12 members each. They play on special occasions, such as, the Republic Day, the Independence Day and others. Members sport vibrant uniforms, as they play snare drum, bass drum, trumpet and flute, setting a benchmark for other primary schools.

""I carefully picked their outfit, which includes a green T-shirt, a white half pant/skirt, white shoes, a tri-coloured cap and a scarf, to exude an aura of patriotism,"" said principal Sushil Kumar.

From introducing smart classes to the music bands, Kumar is leaving no stone unturned in transforming the school's image into that of a model school. ""I saw how in private schools, enthusiastic children took out Republic Day processions on the symphony of ensembles. I wanted that for our kids here as well,"" he said.

Eleven-year-old Man Singh, who is on the bass drum, said, ""It is a wonderful experience. We get to dress differently and perform in public."" Another student, Sachin Kumar, 10, who is on the snare drum, added, ""I feel happy when we perform and the spectators appreciate us."" Their training was facilitated by district scout master Rajendra Tripathi.

Eager to bring about a change, Kumar said he bought the musical instruments using the money received as part of the 'Excellent School Award' won by the institute during the Akhilesh Yadav regime.

School teacher Jyoti Rawat, 33, said, ""On hearing about an upcoming event, children get ecstatic. Performing in front of their parents and relatives make them feel they are doing something extraordinary.""

Showering praise on the Kumar's initiative, Skand Shukla, deputy secretary, director basic shiksha parishad, Allahabad, said, ""This initiative of forming music band in a government run primary school is a shining example for other school principals to replicate. It will make education more fun.""

The school is technologically equipped with a projector, laptops and computers. Little wonder then that the student attendance is as high as 80% and the number of enrolments have gone up from 119 to 160. In April, this year, the school also got recognised as an English medium school, which is helping attract students even from private schools, said school authorities.

""The government and various NGOs helped this school in many ways, such as, providing furniture, laptops, computers and drinking water facilities among others,"" said Kumar, who was felicitated with the national Information and Communication Technology award in 2017.

He also used crowd funding on Facebook to get money to upgrade the infrastructure. Acknowledging the community's support, Kumar said, ""Computers were given to us by the Baba Amarnath Sewa Mandal, sports equipment came from community members, furniture came from Govind Industry, and mid day meals are provided by the government.""

""Out of five classes, two are furnished with tables and chairs. For the others, we will arrange furniture soon. Our premises are also very clean, as much emphasis is placed on personal and environmental hygiene. I am working on providing maximum learning to students through minimum investment.

The school staff had seen a letter tucked in the lock of the school entrance as well as pasted another pasted on its wall. One of the letter demanded that the school authorities should return the original documents of some students and that if the authorities did not do so, the students of the school will be killed.

The other letter has demanded Rs 10crore from the school and threatened of dire consequences if this did not happen. It also mentions the name of some students and asks that they should be beaten up at the school.

After the incident came to light, the sarpanch of the village and other officials decided to give a deadline of 12 hours for anyone who had written the letter to come forward and admit it. When this did not happen, the school officials gave a complaint to the police. An offence based on the complaint is, however, yet to be registered.

"3907","","The recently released Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2017-18 has revealed that the number of students at primary schools in the state has been declining for the last three years.

The survey reveals that the number of children attending Class 1 to 8 had fallen from 16.17 million in the academic year 2014-15 to 15.91 million in 2017-18 - a drop of 1.6%. The enrolment at secondary and higher secondary level (Class 9 to 12) went up by 7.6%, from 6.18 million to 6.64 million over the same period.

Experts have not been able to identify the exact reasons behind the drop in the number of children in primary school; they have implied that the fall in the number of children in primary schools could be because of rising dropout rates and a dip in fertility rates. Though India is ensuring that a larger proportion of children remain in school, dropout rates are still a concern. A study titled 'School Dropouts: Examining the space of reasons' authored by Arun NR Kishore and KS Shaji, published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, says that in 1993, 27 million children were enrolled in Class I in schools across the country. In 2003, only 10 m of these children (one in three) reached Class 10.

Two separate sets of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) can explain the fall in the number of children in primary schools. The NFHS 4 for 2015-16, released last year, says that the number of children below 15 years, as a percentage of the total population of Maharashtra, fell to 24.5% in 2015-16 compared to 30.6% in 2005-2006 when NFHS 3 was compiled. Similarly, the fertility rate - the number of children born to a woman - has declined from 2.1 to 1.9 between the periods of the two surveys.

During this period, the state's population has grown, though moderately, and NHFS data does not indicate whether this fall in proportion of under-15 in the state's population has also resulted in a decline in absolute numbers. But data from the national population census reveal that the absolute number of children are also declining. The state's child population (in this case, children up to six years) was 13.32 million in 2011 - a decline of around 345,000 from the earlier population count in 2001. As a percentage of the total population, the proportion of children up to six years has dropped from 17.1% in 1991 to 14.1% in 2001, falling further to 11.9% in 2011. The proportion could be below 10% now if the trend has continued.

All these data suggest that women in Maharashtra are having fewer children, resulting in the drop in the number of students in primary schools. Data on school enrolment also suggest that the decline in number of students in primary schools could be because of a drop in the absolute numbers for that age group. A study of over 100,000 households, conducted last year by the Maharashtra government, found that 99.3 per cent children in age group 6-14 years were attending school.

The changes in Maharashtra's child demographics follow trends in other parts of the country. The NFHS shows that in Kerala, the proportion of children below 15 years fell from 24.4% of the population in 2005-06 to 20.2% in 2015-16. Even in Bihar, where fertility rates are still high - though it fell from 4 in 2005-2006 to 3.4 in 2015-16, the proportion of under-15 fell from 43.8% to 39.3 during the same period.

Education experts have said that when there is a drop in the number of students in schools because of demographic changes, there is an opportunity to improve facilities in schools as the per-capita spend (money spent on each child) on education goes up, with opportunities to pursue a lower student-teacher ratio and better infrastructure.

Of course, teaching and learning standards, especially in schools run by the state government and municipal corporations, continue to be abysmal. The Annual Status of Education (ASER) survey showed that only 27% of students in Class 8 can read Class 2-level texts and 31% of Class 8 students can do the simple mathematical exercise of dividing numbers.","Population changes might have led to fall in primary school numbers in Maharashtra","829487404","2018-03-11","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/population-changes-might-have-led-to-fall-in-primary-school-numbers-in-maharashtra/story-1wjUeJt1EEVyJjbSRvLgtL.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Alleging that the question insulted them, the teachers' union of primary schools has threatened to approach the Allahabad high court on the issue.

Devendra Srivastava, district unit president of Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, said if the UP Board of Secondary Education did not take action on the issue, ""we will be forced to approach the court against the same.""

One of the questions read, ""Write a letter to the district magistrate of your district drawing his attention towards the laxity of primary school teachers in performing their duties? ""

The question appeared in the English paper for class 12 students. The question paper was given to the students in Lucknow and the adjoining districts on February 21.

Deepak Mishra, a teacher in a government-run primary school in Koraon tehsil of Allahabad, said such a question ""is a sheer insult to us and our dedication"".

""We decry such people who are involved in the act and seek action by the (UP) Board against them,"" he said.

Kalpana Mishra, another primary school teacher in Allahabad, also objected to the question. She asked if the same question had been asked about secondary school teachers, how would they have felt.

"4004","","In new sex education guidance in the United Kingdom, primary school children as young as eight years old will be told 'boys can have periods' too. To tackle the taboo around menstruating, teachers have been advised similarly by Brighton Council to teach young children. However, the new rules have received harsh criticism for trying to confuse young children.

The teacher guidance, from Brighton & Hove City Council, states: 'Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods' and 'menstruation must be inclusive of all genders'. It says that ""bins for used period products are provided in all toilets"" for children. Also, trans pupils and students should be provided with additional support from a school nurse if required.

The emergence comes after it was reported that a state secondary in Brighton has 40 pupils who 'do not identify as gender presented at birth'. Daily Mail quoted Tory MP David Davies as saying that explaining the concept of transgender boys having periods to eight-year-olds would be 'insanity' for teachers. He said, ""Learning about periods is already a difficult subject for children that age, so to throw in the idea girls who believe they are boys also have periods will leave them completely confused.""

Stephanie Davies-Arai, from the campaign group Transgender Trend, said, ""Girls going through puberty are already having a difficult time. What they should be given is clear language to be able to talk about their bodies and their female biological functions without couching it in politically correct terms."" Campaigner Julie Bindel said, ""To tell impressionable children that boys can also menstruate sidelines girls who should be getting support when they start their periods.""

The report quoted Brighton & Hove City Council as saying, ""By encouraging effective education on menstruation and puberty, we hope to reduce stigma and ensure no child or young person feels shame in asking for period products inside or outside of school if they need them. We believe that it's important for all genders to be able to learn and talk about menstruation together...

"4009","","Few would disagree that one of the most remarkable aspects of India is the rich diversity of the cultures, traditions and languages which are found among the people living in this vast country. There is no better symbol for this diversity than the ancient banyan tree with its huge structure, deep roots and many branches which give shelter to so many different living beings.

Choosing the languages that are to be used in primary education is therefore no easy matter, and decisions will necessarily depend on local and regional infrastructures which vary enormously. While many teachers intuitively know that it is important to use the languages children speak at home also as the medium of instruction in school, there is considerable parental pressure to use more English in schools. Managing and reconciling different demands is no easy matter for policy makers and evidence is needed to ensure these decisions are well-informed. For this reason, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli from Cambridge University, and co-investigators from Reading University and academic institutions in India have started a new research project which focuses on multilingualism in primary schools in India. The project - in partnership with British Council - aims to provide policy makers, teachers, parents and (last but not least) the children themselves with new evidence which can help them to make better choices about schooling.

The MultiLila project aims to find out whether children who learn through the medium of a language which is different from their home languages have differing levels of learning outcomes than children whose home and school language is the same: do they learn more, or less, faster or slower? It also explores whether or not there are differences in the learning attainment of children attending schools in more deprived areas and between boys' and girls' learning of reading and maths. On a recent visit to Delhi, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli from the University of Cambridge, Principal Investigator of the project, discussed these issues with the Minister of Education in Delhi, Mr Manish Sisodia, who is keen to ensure educational policies are based on scientific evidence. Ms Atishi Marlena, advisor on education to the AAP-led Delhi government, concurred saying: 'With this project, we are also going to be the recipients of their research. British Council India and Cambridge University will provide us with a lot of insights on this.'

As all teachers know, it can be challenging to explain new concepts to learners. Concepts such as evaporation or condensation are not easy to understand for primary school children, who may struggle to grasp what these chemical processes involve. This is particularly true for children who learn through the medium of a second language, which is the case in schools where English is the medium of instruction. Most children do not speak English at home, but a variety of other languages, and they are still in the process of learning English. They may be able to use some everyday words and grammatical constructions, such as 'What's your name?' or 'I like reading' but this is not a sufficient basis for understanding abstract, academic or technical words such as condensation. An added problem is that translation equivalents may not be available or known in the local or regional languages.

Thus, one colleague present at one of the schools visited by the research team did not know the translation equivalent of 'condensation' in Hindi, despite being highly fluent in the language. Presenting children with translation equivalents in Hindi is not helpful if the concept itself is poorly understood. Despite these difficulties, some teachers excelled at explaining such ideas by making reference to the children's home environment: they asked the children to think about what happens to boiling water when their dinner is prepared at home. The children know that during cooking, water turns into steam which rises up into the air (evaporation) and it may subsequently condensate against the window. This can be seen on the window in the form of droplets (condensation). According to Professor Theo Marinis such explanations are best understood when the teacher uses the children's home languages: 'Developing children's understanding of science concepts and analytical skills in discussing these builds on language, as does learning in other school subjects.'

This is also true for so-called word problems in maths. These are short stories which contain an arithmetic problem that needs to be extracted by the child, as in: 'Ritu walks around the playground. The playground is a square, which means it has the same length on all the four sides. The playground is 20 meters along. Ritu walks all around the edges of the playground. How many meters does she walk in total?' Tackling such problems is only possible for a child who has a good understanding of the language used in the task, and this can be very challenging for children who learn through the medium of English. Many children will need to make use of their home languages in order to fully grasp what they need to do.

A key issue for all teachers and policy makers is therefore understanding what threshold level is needed for children to be able to take part in English-medium instruction: what is the minimum amount of English needed? This could be specified in terms of the number of words that need to be known but knowledge of grammar is equally essential. From the available literature we know that it can take between five and ten years until children are ready to handle the complexities of school subjects through the medium of a second language, but further evidence is needed to establish what thresholds are applicable in a variety of Indian contexts.

The MultiLila project takes place in three cities: Delhi (Professor Minati Panda), Hyderabad (Professor Suvarna Alladi and Dr Lina Mukhopadhyay) and Patna (Dr Lina Mukhopadhyay) and is funded by the UK's Economic Social and Research Council and by The Department for International Development. 'Key partners in the project are researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), English and Foreign Languages University (Hyderabad) and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Karnataka, as well as the British Council,' says Professor Tsimpli, 'as they know the Indian context.'

Currently, data collection is underway, with around 1,000 child participants (Standard IV) in the database. The same children will re-take the same language, cognitive and maths assessments in a year's time to establish development of skills over time under different conditions. Final research findings are to be expected to be reported in 2020.","Language Matters In Science And Maths In Primary Schools","1008532200","2018-12-02","http://businessworld.in/article/Language-Matters-In-Science-And-Maths-In-Primary-Schools/02-12-2018-164719"," BW | Businessworld",FALSE
"4012","","BENGALURU: On the 63rd Karnataka Rajyotsava Day, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy reiterated that the government's decision to make English compulsory from Class 1 will not hurt Kannada and that the language wouldn't be allowed to dominate the sovereign status of Kannada.

According to him, the decision was taken with the sole purpose of ensuring rural children overcome their inferiority complex.

In September, he had said: ""We will protect and promote Kannada. But at the same time, we want to ensure students from rural areas and middle-class families learn English in order to remain competitive in this fastchanging world."" Learning another language does not amount to disrespecting the mother tongue, he had added.

On Thursday, he urged the people of Karnataka not to listen to voices that seek to divide the state on regional lines. ""Some voices have been spreading disinformation, seeking to divide the state on nomenclatures such as north Karnataka and old Karnataka. People shouldn't pay attention to them. We should all strive for development of the state and ensure that our elders' struggle for a unified state is not wasted,"" he said.

The CM made some announcements on the occasion, including extension of the warm milk scheme to 10,567 students in 153 special schools run by NGOs. At present, 55.3 lakh students are covered under it.

Festival for, by children

The government organised a cultural festival for children at Kanteerava Stadium, which saw the participation of over 10,000 students from 90-odd schools from Bengaluru north and south districts.

Around 800 students from north Bengaluru institutions presented a colourful dance programme depicting the life of city chieftain Kempegowda. Their counterparts from a government school in Chikkabidarakallu highlighted the importance of learning through their performnace.

Students from 21 schools participated in a mass yoga programme. Children from Mariam School and Florence School, donning a yellow and red attire (colours of the state flag), performed an aerobic dance.

KANNADA PARADE COMMANDS ADD ZING

Crisp parade commands in Kannada echoed true and loud at the Dakshina Kannada Rajyotsava Day celebrations in Mangaluru on Thursday.

Having resonated in Marathi-inclined Belagavi for three years, thanks to SP BR Ravikanthe Gowda's stint as district police chief there, Kannada parade commands have made their way to Dakshina Kannada, with reserve police inspector Ganesh HB reeling them out with panache. Normally done in English or Hindi, Kannada parade commands were a rarity till Ravikanthe Gowda introduced them in Belagavi. An elated Ganesh said it was a thrilling experience for him to give parade commands in Kannada for the first time. ""I had the SP guide me intensively for the past two days to get the intonations, pause and delivery right,"" Ganesh said.","English in primary schools won't hurt Kannada: CM - Times of India","984426279","2018-11-02","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/english-in-primary-schools-wont-hurt-kannada-cm/articleshow/66470278.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"4023","","In Singapore, children will no more be ranked on the basis of the scores they receive in exams. According to a new move by the Education Minister Ong Ye Kung, the government has decided to abolish student ranking system for primary and secondary school children.

In a bid to encourage children the schools will no more show the student's position in their report books. On September 29, The Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the change will let students focus more on his or her learning progress. It will thus discourage them from comparisons and being overly concerned about their performances.

Here are the details that will be dropped from report cards:

The education ministry in a statement said, ""The change is to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned about comparisons.""

Abiding by the new rules, all examinations for Primary 1 and 2 pupils will also be removed. Reportedly, MOE said that the teachers will encourage learning through discussion, homework and quizzes. Teachers will use ""qualitative descriptors"" instead of marks and grades to evaluate students' performance.

Addressing around 1,700 school leaders, Ong said, ""I know that 'coming in first or second', in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student's achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from young that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline they need to master for life.""

He further said, ""Notwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses."" For older students in primary and secondary schools, marks will be rounded off and given as a whole number.

For the first time, primary health centres (PHC), primary schools and anganwadi centres in Jammu and Kashmir will come under the administrative control of the panchayats when elections to the local body will be completed next month, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said Friday.

The home minister said powers for 'own fund generation' like collection of the building permission fees, taxes on entertainment, advertisement, hoardings, various kinds of businesses and profession will also be given to the panchayats.

""The functions and functionaries of all the 29 subjects transferred to the panchayats under the 73rd amendment of the Constitution will be transferred to the Panchayats of Jammu and Kashmir, including institutions like primary health centers, primary schools, aganwadi centers to name a few,"" he said in a statement.

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act was passed by the Parliament in 1993. The amendment provided a constitutional status to the panchayati raj institutions. The act was enforced upon all the state governments, except Jammu and Kashmir.

The polls to elect 4,130 sarpanches (village headmen), 29,719 panches (panchayat members) and 1,145 ward commissioners in Jammu and Kashmir will be held next month.

Singh said the elections will also pave the way for making available nearly Rs 4,335 crore of 14th Finance Commission central grants to the duly constituted local bodies.

The home minister said financial powers of panchayats are being enhanced 10 times from Rs 10,000 to Rs 1 lakh. Similarly, they are being increased from Rs 25,000 to Rs 2.5 lakh for block councils.

The central and the state government funds will further supplement 'own funds' of the panchayats under various schemes such as MGNERGA, PMAY, ICDS, mid-day meal etc.

"4033","","For the first time, government primary school students in Uttar Pradesh will have to attend school on Vishwakarma Puja on Monday, which was declared as a holiday in the previous years.

Vishwakarma Puja, which is celebrated on 17 September ever year, marks the birth anniversary of Hindu god Lord Vishwakarma, who is known as the 'architect of gods'.

Representational image. News18

In a letter, Uttar Pradesh's Basic Shiksha Parishad secretary, Ruby Singh, asked all education officers to ensure schools remain open on Monday and hold programmes to educate children about the teachings of Vishwakarma.

According to The Times of India, last year, schools in the state remained open on 17 September, due to a pulse polio campaign, despite it being a Sunday. The Yogi Adityanath-led government increased the number of restricted holidays from 16 to 30 this year with Vishwakarma Puja as one of them.

""The Vishwakarma Puja was always an off day for schools until this year. Celebrations will take place for the first time,"" the report quoted an official as saying.

It is believed that Lord Vishwakarma built palaces, weapons and buildings for the gods. He is known as the 'God of Vastu Shastra', the 'First Engineer', the 'Engineer of the Gods' and the 'God of Machines'. On this day, workers such as architects, carpenters, engineers, artists, mechanics and factory workers take a break from their jobs and clean up the machines, tools, equipment etc. in their offices and factories, as per News18.

The festival is primarily celebrated in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Bihar, Tripura, and Odisha.

"4037","","Badanehal Dattatreyagoud, Kannada protagonist in areas bordering Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, spoke about the threat to Kannada with the State government deciding to introduce the English medium in primary schools.

""As of now, Kannada is threatened as as people speaking the language have reduced on one hand and other languages are becoming dominant in border areas. In this situation, the government's decision to introduce the English medium will severely affect the development of Kannada,"" he said.

Mr. Dattatreyagoud was delivering the presidential address at the sixth two-day Gadinad Kannada Sahitya Sammelan at Holagundi in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, adjoining Ballari district, on Monday. ""I appeal to all Kannada protagonists, littérateurs, activists, organisations, among others to oppose the government's move and prevail upon it to review its decision,"" he urged.

He was also of the view that lack of exchange of views by coordination committees had caused a problem. ""Kannada, needs all support and encouragement, without which organising sammelans and meetings would be a waste. The State government should revise its order on 5% reservation in State Civil Services for all those in the country who have studied in Kannada medium from 1st to 10th standard by removing the phrase 'all over the country' and limiting it to horanaadu/gadinaadu Kannadigas,"" he said.

He also underlined the need for the State government to provide hostel facilities for students in border areas irrespective of their caste, creed and income. The Kannada Book Authority, which has been providing books to school libraries should do so for Kannada medium schools in border areas too.

"4038","","27 lower primary Kannada-medium schools have less than 10 students

As many as five private aided Kannada medium schools and two government primary schools have been closed for lack of students in Udupi district for the present academic year.

The five aided schools are Ganapathi Aided Higher Primary School, Nalkuru, Little Flower Higher Primary School, Belman, Aided Secondary School, Mattukopla, Nityasahayamatha Aided Higher Primary School, Yellur, and UBMC Aided Higher Primary School, Santhur.

The two government primary schools that have been closed down are Government Lower Primary School, Kadthala, and Government Lower Primary School, Siddapur.

According to K. Seshashayana, Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI), there were teachers in accordance with the number of students in aided schools. If teachers retired, there was no provision for appointment of new teachers in aided schools.

These schools did not get maintenance grants. This made running them tough, he said.

The two government lower primary schools are being closed because of migration of younger brothers and sisters studying in these schools with their elder brother and sisters to higher primary schools.

Yet another reason for the closure of these schools is parents' inclination towards English-medium schools. Besides, the school buses of English-medium schools are now picking children even from villages.

But the problem is that once the number of students declined in the schools, the number of teachers appointed there also went down.

There are 27 government lower primary Kannada-medium schools in the district which have a strength of less than 10 students in the present academic year.

These schools having less than 10 students have one teacher and another guest teacher.

Yet another reason for schools closing down or having less than 10 students is the decline in population growth in the district.

But bucking the trend, there are schools, where the number of students increased in Class One such as in government schools in Thekkatte, Basrur and Koteshwar. ""As many as 101 students have been admitted to Class One in Thekkatte,"" Mr. Seshashayana said.

Again the seven primary schools, which have been closed for the present academic year, could be opened in the next two years, if there are five students desiring to join the schools there.

If there are no students for three years in a row, then they are closed down. Then, the documents of such schools are shifted to the neighbouring higher primary schools.","Seven primary schools shut down in Udupi district","913695782","2018-07-27","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Mangalore/seven-primary-schools-shut-down-in-udupi-district/article24528269.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

This is the first of its kind initiative of the municipal corporation to turn primary schools into green campuses by adopting green initiatives like rooftop solar plants, indoor and outdoor LED lighting, rainwater harvesting, utilizing of renewable energy systems like solar water heater, solar cooker, solar air conditioning, solar lantern etc.

Official sources said SMC has partnered with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Torrent Power for rainwater harvesting, LEDs and five-star rated fans for solar power plants. The primary schools are located in areas like Katargam, Ved Road, Athwalines, Karanj and Althan.

The entire project is based on the public-private-partnership (PPP) model. While ONGC will bear the total cost of Rs 20 lakh for rainwater harvesting, the cost of Rs 26 lakh for solar power plants will be borne by municipal corporation and the central government. Torrent Power will be fitting the LEDs and fans from its corporate social responsibility (CSR) fund.

"4042","","Our work is to empower citizens, this is made possible by your donation. Donate

One of the most pressing challenges faced by the Indian education system is to bridge the gap between the infrastructure and quality of education in a private school and that of a government school. While the government rethinks its model for public schools across the country, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and citizen groups have taken it upon themselves to bring about change.

The Avasar Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO recently inaugurated a pre-primary school at the Seegehalli Government Higher Primary School located in Kadugodi, near Whitefield in Bengaluru. This pre-primary school has been built on the kindergarten model that is seen in private schools today. The free-of-cost school will cater to the needs of children aged between 3 and 6 years from underprivileged families.

Pre-primary education costs of one child in India can exceed a minimum of Rs. 45,000 per year in a private school. Combine the lack of government incentives and infrastructure with the acute financial barrier that families below the poverty line face, and you get a public education system which has to combat a serious setback.

The Avasar Foundation plans to explore possible solutions. The problem isn't only financial. Underprivileged families have not yet witnessed or know about the importance of pre-primary education. While government schools are still struggling to set the facility up, admission to private pre-primary schools only continues to become more competitive.

Where many children embark on their journey of learning at the age of three in private schools, the kids who miss out on this have to spend time trying to catch up with other kids who had the opportunity. There are government preschools like Anganwadi's. The Government of Karnataka has launched pre-primary (LKG and UKG) classes in government schools. But as of now, the gap still remains apparent.

This is where the Avasar Foundation is trying to help. ""The Avasar Pre-primary School bridges an important gap we notice in early childhood education, especially for the underprivileged families who cannot afford to send their wards to expensive private play schools. This is a pilot project and more such playschools will come up in neighbouring government schools from the next academic year based on the corporate sponsorship we are able to mobilise,"" says Anand Chaturvedi, Managing Trustee, and Founder of The Avasar Foundation.

The first school by the Avasar Foundation was unveiled on 6th July 2018 at the Government Higher Primary School, Seegehalli the parents and children in the presence of the BEO for K.R. Puram, Saleem Pasha, and chief guest Kamlesh Jha, Director, Terex India. The event marked the official hand-over of the school to the government authorities.

The preschool is part of the CSR project led by Expeditors- a Fortune 500, global logistics company. Avasar Foundation has not only invested in the infrastructure but has also provided the staff to maintain the school. The pre-primary school curriculum is structured along the lines of the private kindergarten model. The school has been completely redone. The rooms which now constitute the school were once dark, with paint chipping off walls and had a seepage issue. In their earlier condition, the rooms would not qualify to be a preschool on any account. Now the rooms are well-lit, colourful and exactly how one would envision a preschool to be. ""Avasar Foundation has changed the look of the school, if you look at it now you wouldn't think this is a government school!"" said Saleem Pasha (BEO) about the new pre-primary school.

Building a preschool requires those who engage in the project to consider many factors before drawing up plans. Preschools cater to the needs of children who are very young, therefore safety and security are of the utmost importance. Children need supervision and sensitive caretakers, therefore the selection of staff has to be done keeping this in mind.

Refurbished at a cost of about Rs. 8 Lakhs, the state-of-the-art preschool will be managed by The Avasar Foundation - the implementation agency for Expeditors. The school is equipped to handle 40 students currently. Two teachers and a caretaker have been appointed to manage the school. Admissions and education at the preschool will be completely free of cost and will be allotted purely on a first-come-first-served basis. In addition to providing infrastructure to schools, it also provides faculty to ensure that the infrastructure is put to good use.

The preschool has begun functioning in the academic year 2018-19 and the age group of the students enrolled is between three to six years. The preschool has incorporated all safety measures and young children's needs, including CCTV surveillance, and disabled-friendly restrooms. There are two refurbished classrooms, one for the Lower Kindergarten students and the other for the Upper Kindergarten students.

The preschool education of each child enrolled will be completed upon turning six. Through continuous evaluation and activities, the child will be assessed on his/her knowledge and ability to apply the same. The medium of instruction at the school will be the child's mother tongue. A budget of Rs. 12-15 Lakhs for 2018-19 has been secured and the project is managed by Malavika Chaturvedi, Program Manager at The Avasar Foundation.

Towns have temples, temples only flourish when all the people of the town join hands to ensure the upkeep of the temple. Otherwise, the temple will fall into disrepair. It's the same with the (government) schools. I hope they continue to care about our schools like this,"" said BEO, Saleem Pasha, at the inaugural function.

The Avasar Foundation is a small NGO that has worked over the past six years on the gaps in the Indian government education system. Founded by Anand Chaturvedi and Sriram SN in 2012 as a CSR initiative of Expeditors, the organisation believes that, ""Ability is nothing without opportunity."" The organisation is currently based in five major cities across India, and believes in bringing opportunities to those who have abilities but face financial and cultural barriers.

Avasar's scholarship program currently funds the education of 45 girls over the age of 15. The scholarship is provided on the basis of merit and need. It covers the entire cost of education right from PUC until they complete their undergraduate degrees. The NGO also provides skill training to the girls to ensure that they are not only educated but are also employed. Avasar Foundation's Digital Literacy Program has provided state-of-the-art computer labs to government schools across India along with teachers to teach the subject in schools.

Government education faces many hurdles on a day-to-day basis such as a lack of funding and inadequate infrastructure. It's not enough to have classrooms and buildings, there need to be students in those classrooms and teachers to teach them. The Avasar pre-primary school then comes at a crucial time and doubles up as an optimistic sign of things to come. The real test for the school will be the response and the feedback it gets, and the ability to emulate the model elsewhere.","Pre-primary section in govt schools: this Bengaluru NGO creates a model to follow |","908573810","2018-07-19","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/pre-primary-section-in-govt-schools-here-is-a-model-school-in-bengaluru-to-follow-26301","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE

Responding to KDA's stand, Shaw said ""political malcontents"" are trying to play mischief with her tweets and added that she stood by her comments that students should learn Kannada and English for competent job opportunities.

""...I stand by this for the sake of Karnataka's youth. Pls don't twist my comments. CM is also saying this #CMofKarnataka (sic),"" she added.

Taking objection to Shaw's comments, KDA Chairman S G Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to her seeking apology. He expressed anguish over Shaw's tweets.

""I have no option but to sympathise with your views on education, that is devoid of cultural and human values,"" he said.

The Governor said that if teachers adopt the ZIIEI methods, it would not only sharpen the leadership and academic skills of students but also make schools social centres where children can learn empathy and interpersonal relations.

""I hope that the teachers in Meghalaya will adopt these methods and help students excel not only in studies but in life as well,"" he said.

It may be noted that Sri Aurobindo Society's training programme for teachers will begin in Meghalaya next month on the basis of an MoU signed by the Meghalaya Government last month.

Mahesh told The Times of India that improving overall quality of education in government schools, streamlining the appointment process of teachers were among his other top priorities. Pointing to the need to prepare students to suit the requirements of the job market, Mahesh said, ""We are at the crossroads. Job opportunities in the government sector are shrinking, and they are under 1%, while employment is higher in the private sector. The reality is that most of the engineering students passing out of our institutions are not employment-ready. So, I am planning to introduce skill education at the school level.""

Mahesh emphasised the need to train students particularly in soft skills such as communication abilities. ""Otherwise, they will end up either as security guards or police constables. So, my idea is to provide skill training at an early stage so that they can either get jobs in the private sector, or be capable of starting their own firms,"" he added.

Affirming his commitment to strengthening RTE, Mahesh said, ""There are complaints of students from underprivileged sections gaining admission to private schools being treated like untouchables. I will hold a discussion with activists about this.""

Mahesh plans to strengthen the public education system by streamlining the administrative processes pertaining to appointment and transfer of teachers. ""Nearly 10,000 teachers who were selected are still waiting for their appointment orders. My task is to speed up this process,"" he said.

Of the 24 government primary schools that had to shut down, 22 are Marathi-medium institutes, while one each of Konkani and Hindi medium schools have shut.

The academic year 2017-18 had opened with 781 government primary schools, the number was down to 757 at the end of 11 months, for want of students. There appear to be no takers for government primary schools even though the enrolment across all schools in Goa for Class I increased by around 300 students as against the previous academic session 2016-17.

Meghana Shetgaonkar, deputy director of education, said that several low enrolment government primary schools have been saved from being shut down by amalgamating the students and teachers at the schools with neighbourhood ones. ""This year, we have a proposal from three government primary schools, which had earlier shut due to low enrolment, to be reopened as they see sufficient students now in the neighbourhood to enrol in them.""

Data points to an ongoing migration of students to aided institutes. Educationists have maintained that it is a problem of perception that privately-managed institutes offer better quality of education and infrastructure.

But, the state government, too, as a policy provides facilities like the Balrath buses to aided institutes, which are not on offer to government primary schools.

Now the number of government primary schools to have shut down since 2013-14 has gone up to 137. One the other hand, the number of government-aided schools has remained constant at 400 over the last few years.

In a bid to improve the conditions of government schools, the state has spent over Rs 58 crore already for repair and upgradation of their buildings, along with carrying out plumbing and electrical works. But, according to state documents, government schools are given priority for repair, maintenance and upgradation work, based on the student strength, urgency of repairs required, and condition of schools provided by the directorate of education.

The criteria of student strength to give priority for repairs further puts low enrolment schools at a disadvantage.

Another 300-odd government primary schools could be heading towards closure with fewer than 20 students enrolled in them from Class I to IV.

However, in talukas that are largely rural, government primary schools actually saw their enrolment go up in 2017-18.

Canacona and Quepem were also among the few regions where no new government primary schools had to close during 2017-18.

The RTI reply received from the BMC's education department states that as per RTE, BMC's primary schools need 8,900 teachers however the number of teachers currently teaching at civic primary schools is 8,119 while 781 posts remain vacant, as per data up to September 2017.

Sonar, an activist from Saman Shikshan Mulbhut Adhikar Samiti, said, ""If these many teachers' posts are vacant then this is in violation of the RTE Act. Imagine if the figure is this much for BMC's primary schools then how many posts would be vacant in the primary section of private schools. In many of BMC's schools, one teacher teaches two to three grades together in one class and this should be stopped by filling up the vacant posts of teachers soon.

There are many teachers who have passed their Eligibility Test last year and are awaiting job opportunities."" Sonar filed the RTI on January 12 and he received the reply on April 4.

Mahesh Palkar, Education Officer, BMC's education department said, ""Having 10 per cent posts vacant is allowed as per RTE norms and the RTI figure shows 8 per cent posts vacant. This figure is anyway from September last year.

The vacant posts will soon be filled by June as per the procedure.

The secretary of school education, Punjab, has issued an order, asking the government primary schools to ""decide at their own level"" if they will be able to implement English as the medium of instruction from this session. According to the order, which reached the district education officers on Thursday, 1,886 middle (Class VI to VIII), high (Class VI to X) and senior secondary (Class VI to XII) schools are going for English as their medium of instruction from this session. It is, however, optional and not compulsory for students who want to continue in Punjabi .

""As regards primary schools, a suggestion has been received from teachers that they should be given liberty to start English medium as per their choice and availability of resources. Accordingly, it has been decided that primary school teachers may decide at their own level to start English medium in their schools,"" read the order.

Punjab education minister Aruna Chaudhary claimed that there are more than 800 primary schools, which have expressed their desire to start the English-medium. ""But, seeing that the primary schools have limited resources, we are not forcing them. Soon we will have a figure of primary schools too where English medium is being started and we will release it,"" she said.

A teacher said that logically there is no use of starting English as the medium of instruction from Class VI, if a student has studied in Punjabi from Class I-V. ""The purpose is solved only if the English medium starts right from Class I,"" he said.

However, only maths and science will be taught in English, even in the schools adopting the language as their medium of instruction, from this year, while social studies will be continued to be taught in Punjabi. This decision, as per the orders, has been taken ""on the advise of subject experts in State Council of Educational Research and Training"".

""This is nothing more than confusing the students to make them study general science in English and social studies in Punjabi,"" said another teacher.

The orders further read that the English-medium books are under printing and will reach the schools soon. Teachers have been instructed to ""widely publicise' the English-medium government schools and increase enrollment. Teachers will also undergo a training to teach in English medium.

"4060","","Chief minister Yogi Adityanath, who launched 'School Chalo Abhiyan' and Dastak movement (JE/AES prevention programme), at Siddharth Nagar, Gorakhpur and Deoria on Monday, said the state government is planning to introduce NCERT curriculum to improve quality of education in government-run-primary schools (class 1 to 8).

Till now UP Board text books are taught in these schools and students preparing for competitions have to read NCERT text books separately. The curriculum will be applicable from next academic session as books have not been purchased yet, sources in Basic Shiksha department told HT.

""It is responsibility of the government to educate its people. For the betterment of students in primary schools we have decided to introduce NCERT curriculum,"" said Yogi while addressing a public meeting in Siddharth Nagar after launching the two programmes. He also inaugurated a newly constructed 100 bed maternity ward at district hospital and laid foundation stones of 34 projects worth Rs 52 crores.

He also told the crowd that the government had approved construction of a medical college at Siddharth Nagar and an official announcement will be made soon.

The CM appreciated efforts of those government officials who had adopted and developed schools. He urged public representatives and other government officials to follow suit. Yogi, who distributed school dresses, books and shoes to children, said that under his government 1.54 crore children had enrolled in primary schools last year.

Elaborating about the Dastak scheme, the CM said it was launched in association with Unicef with an aim to check deaths caused by encephalitis by raising awareness about the disease, its causes and prevention. He asked people to contribute for the success of the fortnight-long Dastak programme by getting children between the age group of 5 to 15 years vaccinated under the scheme.

""A large number of children are affected by encephalitis in Gorakhpur and Basti. Don't they have a right to live,"" he said. The chief minister said over 92 lakh children in 38 districts of UP were vaccinated against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and 86,000 students who had missed the vaccination will be covered this time.

Later speaking at Pipraich, the CM claimed that mortality rate due to encephalitis had come down from 25% earlier to 11% in 2017 and said it had to be brought down further to 0%.

He also told the crowd that over 1000 students had enrolled in schools on the first day of 'School Chalo Abhiyan.'

Yogi also visited a dalit slum in Subhashnagar and took stock of sanitation arrangement. He also laid foundation stones of 13 projects and inaugurated three projects.

CM SUSPENDS CMO, FOUR COPS FOR LAXITY

Cracking the whip against officials for laxity in discharging their duties, chief minister Yogi Adityanath suspended Siddharth Nagar CMO Dr Ved Prakash Sharma, SHO Itwa Anil Kumar, S-I Itwa and two police constables on Monday.

District magistrate Siddharth Nagar Kunal S Ilku also reportedly faced the ire of CM for administration's failure on various fronts.

As per reports, action against the CMO was taken when he failed to give satisfactory reply to the CM over his failure to ensure door-to-door encephalitis vaccination under 'Dastak Abhiyan.' Action against police officials came on the complaint of a local woman -- Geeta Devi -- who managed to attract Yogi's attention by waving a piece of paper while sitting among the audience during his public meeting in Siddharth Nagar. The CM called Geeta Devi on the stage and she told him that her neighbour was not letting her raise a wall on her piece of land. When she complained to the police, they did not take action and forced her to put a thumb impression on a sulahnama (agreement). On her complaint, the CM issued suspension orders of four cops and asked the SP to resolve her issues.

Speaking later to media, on the issue of 'Bharat Bandh', Yogi said his government had sympathy with the Dalits and added 'spreading anarchy and disruption in the name of protest is not right.'","Soon NCERT curriculum in government primary schools: Yogi","843092720","2018-04-03","https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/soon-ncert-curriculum-in-government-primary-schools-yogi/story-8PpDSrILApoEzUsXpGAmsO.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"4061","","Government is also taking steps to spread awareness for enrolment into English schools.

With the craze for English-medium schools growing, all eyes will be on government-run 5,000 English-medium primary schools which will become operational with the launch of School Chalo Abhiyan on Monday, minister of state for basic education Anupama Jaiswal said on Sunday.

""Parents queue up for English-medium schools. So we thought why not have government-run English-medium schools to cater to the demand. We will run English-medium schools in each block to provide free education to children,"" she said.

Officials of education department and principals of schools are using social media to promote English-medium schools for admissions.

According to education department officials, the decision was taken as there was a huge demand for English-medium schools.

""The move will give fresh impetus to education in UP. We have identified teachers and have given them postings. The move will encourage parents to withdraw their children from private schools and send them to government-run institutions,"" the minister said.

The government has set up five English-medium schools in each block in all the 75 districts of the state. There are over 820 blocks in UP.

""Instead of setting up new schools, the government has converted existing schools to English-medium institutions after giving training to teachers and providing English books,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh.

He said efforts would be made to ensure that proper English was taught to students.

""Two years ago, the Samajwadi Party government had set up two such schools in every district of the state and the response was overwhelming. The attendance of students went up.

"4063","","HYDERABAD: While the Telangana school education department has accorded recognition to over 4,000 pre-primary schools for the 2018-19 academic year, managements rue how the state has issued no clear policy on the curriculum and teacher training programmes for these institutions.

The department, however, has made it mandatory for these schools to employ a sufficient number of qualified teachers, trained ayahs and other supporting staff for the safety of children.

While managements acknowledged the emphasis on infrastructure and safety measures, they said that the department should have also looked into the issue of curriculum, textbooks and teacher training for pre-primary sections.

""The pre-primary section is crucial as the brain development of a child happens at the age of two-andhalf years to five years. While the government has accorded recognition, it has failed to acknowledge the need for a uniform curriculum for the most crucial period of a child's growth,"" said S Madhusudan, founder of a 30-year-old private school that recently secured recognition.

Due to government's failure in framing a uniform curriculum, managements claim, they are forced to adopt the syllabus published by private players. ""Private players have framed pre-primary curriculum using the Montessori method, which is adopted by a majority of the schools. Others frame their own curriculum by teaching basics such as the alphabet and numbers,"" said Srinivas Reddy, president of the Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association.

In fact, according to a report on the Indian Early Childhood Education Impact in Telangana compiled by Unicef, the absence of standard curriculum has affected the learning levels of children as the quality of pre-school education in the state is inappropriate for a child's development. ""Low school readiness levels in children are clearly related to the quality of pre-school education. The large scale service providers do not use age and developmentally appropriate curriculum, methods and materials to engage children,"" stated the report.

In 2016, the Telangana government had proposed the framing of a curriculum for pre-primary classes. However, sources said the proposal has failed to see the light of the day yet.

"4064","","PUNE: The state education department's claim of improving facilities at schools has fallen flat with a distinct drop in meeting infrastructure norms set under the Right to Education Act for primary schools.

The state economic survey has revealed that out of the seven indicators, there has been slight improvement in only one parameter that of providing computer laboratories while there has been a drop in all the other parameters, including providing separate toilets for girls.

The ministry of human resource development has set an annual deadline of March 31to improve the quality of schools in every state by upgrading their facilities in compliance with the key provisions of the RTE, including drinking water facilities, libraries, toilets, buildings, etc.

Educationists said the government had promised to fulfil the infrastructure requirements that were prescribed in the RTE. However, that hasn't been done and due to this, the quality of education is being affected in state schools. Now, the government is shutting down schools for lack of quality.

Educationist Nihal Kirnalli said, ""The most shocking aspect of the survey is the decline in functional toilets for girls in schools. It has gone down to 96.8% from 99.4% in the last three years. How does the state even claim that it is empowering the girl child? This is ridiculous and it seems the government is lying. The facts on the ground prove it.""

Kirnalli said sports is an important factor in a child's development and the reducing number of playgrounds is a worrying sign. ""Surely, there is some improvement in providing computers, but it is of no use if there are less number of libraries than before, drinking water facilities have reduced and there are no toilets,"" Kirnalli added.","Primary schools score low on infrastructure under RTE - Times of India","834155773","2018-03-19","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/primary-schools-score-low-on-infrastructure-under-rte/articleshow/63360997.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

This has been decided in keeping with the medium of instruction policy which the state government has adopted, where it is consciously promoting primary education in Konkani/Marathi medium. Fifteen institutes and trusts had sought permissions to open new English-medium schools from June 2018.

While during the last two academic years, no new primary school was granted permission to begin operations, including Konkani/Marathi ones, during 2018-19 some new regional language schools are expected to be granted permission to open, director of education G P Bhat said.

""Konkani/Marathi schools will be granted permission to open if they are not affecting enrolment in neighbourhood schools,"" said Bhat.

For the academic year 2018-19, DoE has received 61 applications to open new primary schools in the state. Of these, 24 applications are from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools and another 14 to start Marathi-medium schools. DoE has received applications to begin seven new Urdu medium institutions and one application to open a Sindhi language school.

For Konkani or Marathi-medium primary schools, the state has relaxed the distance criteria from neighbourhood schools.

"4070","","UMA VISHNU: What has been the biggest takeaway from the 2017 ASER (Annual Status of Education Report)?

In fact, I was surprised by things that were good. About 75% students in the age group of 14-18 years can read at least Class 2 textbooks. This is also the number of students who can read Class 2 textbooks at age 14, according to regular ASER. Which means that after 14 years, the number does not drop. Because if you're not using your literacy, you can forget how to read, it is possible. But that doesn't happen and that was a good thing.

Also, the fluency rate grew by 7-8 percentage points within the total number of readers. We also found that 7-8 percentage point more young people, than at age 14, can read at least a sentence in English. So, even though nobody is teaching you English formally, the number seems to increase. This was both interesting and surprising and will help us in the long run.

In math or arithmetic, on the other hand, the number of children who can do division or just about do division remains at 41-42% in the 14-18 age group. That is where the issues come up.

Let's take the example of bank loans. Now say one bank is giving you a loan at 11% interest and another at 13%. Which bank will you choose? 70% students chose the right bank. But if they are told that a shirt for '300 is available on 10% discount, only 40% could figure out the cost of the shirt.

Now, this is a problem because it is a generation which is being told that you can have bank accounts, Jan-Dhan Yojana etc. A large number of this demographic has bank accounts and has been depositing money. A large number of women too deposit money in banks. They've not used ATMs, but they are being told about e-banking, mobile payments etc. But if you don't know what the calculations are or you don't have support systems to do the calculations, then how are you going to figure it out?

So, there are a lot of warning flags out there. When it comes to general knowledge, a large number of kids could not identify their state or its capital on the map of India. I don't know what to make of that. In an ASER pilot test survey, many years ago, we asked kids who the man on the currency note, with no hair and a pair of glasses was. A lot of kids did not know who the man was. When we asked them who they thought it could be, some of them said, 'It must be the person who got the notes printed'.

UMA VISHNU: You have sent out these warning signals for very long now but why is it that there is still confusion about ways to fix the problem?

I can tell you how the debates went. For example, in 2004-05, when UPA-I came to power, the NCERT made an effort to create a National Curriculum Framework. That was an excellent exercise... It was a mass-scale effort of a lot of educationists. They talked about constructivism etc. But today, 12 years later, the language that was generated in the NCERT then has not percolated to lower levels. Translating the principles into practice proved to be difficult. Back then we were saying that we should start by setting small goals and achieving them... If you think that everyone will be able to follow your philosophy of constructivism, it might not work.

In the early days, no one was willing to talk about 'learning outcomes'. For the first time, in the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Planning Commission said learning outcomes were important; till then, the HRD Ministry would not listen. After 2012, 'learning outcomes' has become a buzzword in the ministry too. We would like to take some credit for that.

Now, NCERT has come out with a long list for grade-wise learning outcomes to be achieved, which is going to the other extreme. See, children need to learn to read. If I ask a kid to stand here and read, either the kid can read or he can't. Or they can read a little bit. You can't create a grade or scale of 10 or 15. It should be something so simple and transparent that even parents can understand.

What NCERT has done is create an 'educationist' standard of learning outcomes which is very difficult to understand for a lay person. Reading may be fine but it becomes difficult with mathematics. If you see the survey published by NCERT, the list for learning outcomes for maths is very long and detailed at every grade. If someone asks the teacher, 'Does this child know maths?' and your reply is, 'This child understands angles and regular fractions', it becomes difficult to understand.

I am firmly on the side of the parents and the children -- start with a big, bold approach. But this is not accepted by everybody. There is an argument that it should be done holistically. We don't mind that, but how do you do it? I think we are stuck in what a lot of people used to call best being the enemy of the good. Everybody wants the best. (But) there is confusion. If 70% of children are not going to go beyond Class 10, then only 15-20% will pursue graduation. Then, what is important? That most become the best in science or most learn foundational knowledge?

Even for employment, whether in the organised or unorganised sector, employers are seeking people who are trainable or are willing to absorb training. We don't need a ready-made product for everything, but somebody who can absorb instructions, understand situations and work. We have not been able to create that product.

How do you create that product? It's a very simple thing, but it is in conflict with our ideals of what education should be. That is where the confusion lies. We want to universally create ideal types and we are not able to do so. Ideal or so-called good education today is only for people who can pay more money, and even there it is not ideal.

When you send your children to air-conditioned, elite schools after spending a lot of money, you still pay for tutors that the child goes to in the afternoon. I have never been able to figure out their need for tutors. In Pune, where I live now, I am told a number of schools have private coaching classes inside the school where high school children go for maths and science. Why bother teaching the same syllabus twice? Why not leave the two subjects for private tutors alone? They seem to have hit upon a practical solution. I would love to give the students and their parents an option between regular school classes and private coaching.

RAVISH TIWARI: Through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Right to Education, are we trying to make up for the fact that in the initial years after Independence, the focus was more on higher education than on primary education?

To understand the backwardness in access to education, we have to understand the fact that the population has grown three-four folds since Independence. That's a huge jump. So, you need more schools, more teachers and so on. Except the BIMARU states, all other states achieved 80-90% access to primary education by the '90s. Yes, we could have done better. I think the problem was in the North. There were more socio-political problems in these parts than purely economic ones. Even today, the most backward states, educationally, are those in the BIMARU belt. We did not focus on this belt. The possible reason for that is we should have made (education) a fundamental right at the time of Independence. We said we'll wait for 10 more years and then it never happened.

The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was launched in 2002 and ASER measured the issue of access in 2005 -- 92.4% of the children said that they are enrolled in a school, although that's not to say that they are attending classes every day. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was launched when most of the work was done. The SSA helped in the last mile, and from 92.4% enrollment, (the access) has gone up to 96 % maximum. It's not 100% as yet.

The problem is that we focused on the IITs and primary schools, not on institutions in between the two. For example, we should have realised that we will need more teachers given the rate at which our population is growing. And, this is not just an Indian problem. It's not just the politicians or the education system that is to be blamed. Everybody around the world took it for granted that schooling equals learning. Once ASER started coming out with data, a lot of people started saying that this holds true (at least) for the developing world and that schooling isn't always equal to learning.

After World War II, everybody was talking about universal primary education and ways to achieve it -- open schools, appoint teachers, give books free of cost and education will be taken care of. We pointed out that just opening a school and appointing teachers is not enough, especially when you're universalising it and creating a mass base. It can work when you have a smaller number of children but when the population is growing at this rate, you need to do something more. I think the quality issue is linked to access and a lot of things could have been done and they can still be done.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: When we talk about learning outcomes, what role does a teacher have? It is believed that many of them are in the profession because they didn't get through anything else. How does one change that?

People say that when you become an actor, you can learn to act. So you can become a teacher and then get better at it. Even if you're not a great teacher, becoming a reasonably good teacher is not all that difficult. I believe this. I have seen many young people join the teaching profession. There might be a thing such as, 'Aur kuchch nahin to teaching kar lo (If nothing, one can teach)', but once they start working, they want to do a good job. This again is a belief of mine -- people want to be good at what they do. Not the best maybe, but at least good at what they're doing. Young teachers join with hope, optimism and enthusiasm, but it's the system that kills them in no time.

If you look at our survey, in the age group of 14-18 years, 12-14% children have said they want to be teachers.... I think there are ways in which you can get people to work. If you treat teachers like government servants, they will behave like government servants.

In today's age, I would insist on telling young people that it doesn't matter what you do for a living. That's not you. You must have basic abilities to be able to earn a living and there's nothing wrong in doing whatever job you get. But do it well. People run after permanent jobs... but now many know that there is no such thing as a permanent job. You do something to earn a living but that's not you. You need to nurture your hobbies and other skills.

KAUSHIK DAS GUPTA: You talked about getting one's basics right. Do our basics also need to be reformulated?

It has to be. According to the Census 2011, India is 75% literate. By 2020, we will have 85% -- close to 100% -- literacy. But the method to measure literacy was formulated in the middle of the 20th century. We need to urgently change that definition of literacy. Much has changed. We need digital literacy. We need the ability to learn. Reading has to be a fundamental skill, it needs to be taught in schools. If you don't teach it, it's not a skill that a child will develop naturally. The way we teach maths may have to change if everyone needs to become financially literate.

Many children are not able to do simple division sums. Hence, they lose interest. So I created a game called 'Kal Ka Looter' in our digital initiative. It was actually a calculator. It asks questions like, 'If there are 64 chocolates and 16 friends, how many chocolates will each get?' Nobody knows the multiplication table of 16 and the students must have thought, 'what's the deal with tables, just eat the chocolates'. But if you give them a calculator alongside the sum, the kids will talk among themselves and decipher the buttons and figure out 64/16. It is cooperative learning, it is not cheating.

UMA VISHNU: So you are saying that we should invert the way we teach? Give students calculators first and then teach them basic mathematics?

No. The idea is to get the children interested in something. How do we learn? Right now the system says read this, sit quietly and don't ask questions. But if I get interested in it, I might want to learn. My idea is that when people want to learn, there should be avenues available for learning. But they should first want to learn. And we should bring the children to a point where they would want to learn. There is no 'want' right now, there is just learning by rote so that you can pass Class 10.

The objective should be that anybody who wants to learn anything, anytime, should be able to. That should be made possible. In English, Wikipedia has unlimited scope, but how many people are contributing to the Hindi, Marathi or Nepali Wiki? Very less... We are not putting out knowledge in these languages. The solution then proposed is to teach everybody English. I do not think that is the right solution.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: If calculators are made available, why do we then need to teach addition, subtraction and multiplication?

Basically, mathematics is about learning patterns, relationships, logic, discovering it etc. But that doesn't happen now. I am not saying don't teach students addition, subtraction, multiplication; there is a thrill in numbers, there's poetry in mathematics. Some people will find it extremely difficult to think that there is poetry in mathematics.

The other day, (tabla player) Zakir Hussain was speaking in Gurgaon and, I think, the way a tabla player can explain mathematical patterns, nobody else can. Why we don't use that as a resource is beyond me. So, it is the attitude towards learning that needs to change. Once you finish school and college that's when real learning seems to start.

ARANYA SHANKAR: In January this year, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said CCTV cameras would be installed in all Delhi government schools within three months, giving parents access to their children in class on a real-time basis.

Personally, I do not agree with it. This thought -- that CCTV surveillance is going to make you safer -- is useless. Is that the kind of society we want? Teachers need to be responsible, they need to create good learning atmosphere in schools... That is more important than anybody installing CCTV cameras. You can't have proper surveillance in banks, what will you do by installing CCTVs in schools?

SOMYA LAKHANI: Anganwadi workers and helpers have been demanding, among other things, an increase in honorarium, health insurance and pension after retirement. They earn very little, about '5,000 per month. Do you think this model is going to fail?

This treatment of anganwadi workers as volunteers is not right. But then there is the other question -- if you make them government servants, will they even work? You don't know how that will play out. Workers should get paid -- they can't survive on Rs 3,000-5000. Some people may argue that they only work for three hours etc. But there is need for them to work longer hours to look after kids. We need day-care centres.

Also, are there jobs being created, especially for non-skilled people? That's a big question. When people are not treated well, there will be anger, and this is a large group of people. The government will have to take a call. They will have to take a second look at the anganwadi model.

UMA VISHNU: One of the criticisms about ASER is that your data is processed, that you don't put out raw data.

We have put up a six-page list of people who have accessed ASER data since 2013 on www.asercentre.org. What do our critics mean by raw data? There are some who want us to give them names of villages and children who are a part of the survey data-set. This is not done. But we do release 'raw data' after removing identifiers such as village and other names.

"4071","","PANAJI: The directorate of education (DoE) has received a surge of applications to start new Konkani and Marathi-medium primary schools, but officials are treading carefully in those cases where permissions are being sought even without the special state grants that regional language schools are eligible for.

Sources said that some applicants have expressed their eagerness to open a Konkani or Marathi-medium primary school even if no state grants are extended to them.

DoE officials are worried that this could act as a backdoor entry for English-medium primary schools, as the institutions, after getting permission to open the school, may switch their medium of instruction at a later stage.

Officials are worried that, if a school starts without grants, it will be under no obligation to continue teaching in a regional language and are therefore set to give preference to schools that are counting on state grants to operate.

Educational bodies and trusts that want to start English-medium primary schools have to clear a number of criteria. Mainly these schools should not be in proximity to regional language government or aided primary schools so as to rule out eating into their student share. For those who want to open Konkani or Marathi-medium primary schools, the state has relaxed this distance criteria. Additionally, Konkani and Marathi primary schools also get special grants per child to operate.

As a result of this policy, between 2012 and 2016, over 90 regional language primary schools were allowed to begin operations. However, no English-medium school was given clearance due to the ongoing row over grants to English-medium primary schools.

For the academic year 2018-19, DoE has received 61 applications to open new primary schools in the state. Of these, 24 applications are from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools, 14 to start Marathi-medium schools, seven to begin Urdumedium institutions and one to open a Sindhi language school.

Another 15 institutes and trusts have sought permissions to open English-medium schools from June 2018.","Education department treads cautiously in allowing new primary schools - Times of India","824021413","2018-03-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/education-department-treads-cautiously-in-allowing-new-primary-schools/articleshow/63143671.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4072","","PANAJI: Around 50% of the applications received by the directorate of education to open primary schools have been for Konkani medium. Despite the state government taking a decision that no English primary schools would be granted permission after it announced the medium of instruction (MoI) policy, the directorate of education has still received 15 applications.

Of the 61 applications received for new primary schools in the state, 24 are from educational institutions and trusts for starting Konkani schools in the state, 14 for Marathi medium schools, seven for Urdu, one for Sindi and 15 for English medium. Director of education G P Bhat told TOI , ""We have forwarded all the applications to the additional district education inspector (ADEI) for a feasibility report.""

Bhat said that last year they had not given permission to start any new primary school based on the government policy that there is no need for more.

The applications to start schools are from Mapusa, Vasco, Betim, Margao, Ponda, Tiswadi, Dharbandora, Canacona, Porvorim and Tambdi Surla, among others. The last date for sending in applications was extended from November 30, 2017, to January 31 this year. A senior government officer said that the English primary schools' applications would be directly rejected because it is against the state policy.

The policy encourages primary education in the mother tongue.

""We have not asked additional district education inspector (ADEI) to give a feasibility study for the English medium primary schools,"" a senior government officer said.

The senior government officer said the directorate of education's stand is clear-the government should not grant more permissions to primary schools as there are already an excess. Government schools are being closed, many have lower enrolment. ""There is no need to give more permission for schools,"" senior government officer said.

The government officer said that over the last three years there have been a lot of applications to start Urdu schools from societies and trusts. ""As per law once we receive the applications for new a primary school we asked the ADEI to inspect the site and give a feasibility report and based on the DoE take a call on applications,"" the senior government officer said, adding that in most cases there are objections from the existing schools.

The officer said that first permission is granted to start the school and the following year, after inspecting the school to verify the teachers and students enrolled, it is given recognition.","Education department sees surge in applications to open Konkani primary schools - Times of India","811215032","2018-02-12","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/education-department-sees-surge-in-applications-to-open-konkani-primary-schools/articleshow/62880032.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4073","","Mumbai: In an attempt to increase enrolment and reduce drop out rate in Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) schools, the education department has initiated new plans. The primary section will be extended from Class 4 till Class 5 while secondary section from Class 7 to Class 8.

This move has come so that students do not leave school mid way and continue till secondary section. Currently, students quit BMC schools after completion of primary section (Class 4) and opt for another state or private school. This has increased the drop out rate and reduced enrolment rate in civic-run schools.

By extending the sections students will not move to new schools. Shubhada Gudekar, Chairperson of BMC Education committee, said, ""We will extend classes so that students can have a one stop solution in our schools."" In addition, parents complained about lack of facilities in these schools. Nitesh Diwan, a parent said, ""Various facilities like benches, uniforms and meals are not appropriate in BMC schools. This discourages us to enrol our children.""

From this academic year, the BMC will provide monsoon boots, nutritional snacks and sports uniform for free to students. ""These facilities will be provided along with the 27 objects that are given to students at the start of academic year,"" Gudekar added.

In addition, BMC teachers will now be posted in schools near their vicinity. This has come to reduce travel stress of teachers.

"4074","","Mumbai: In a bid to reduce the dropout rate and increase enrolment in the civic-run schools, the education department is mulling over to adding Class 5 divisions to primary municipal schools while secondary schools could possibly include Class 8 divisions.

This idea was suggested by the education committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to encourage the students to continue in the BMC without taking any intermediate break. There are a total of 1,038 primary schools and 149 secondary BMC schools in Mumbai.

""Students tend to drop out as many primary and secondary schools end at Class 4 and Class 7 respectively. Parents need to enrol their students in other schools if there is no class further, which they tend to avoid, as it is an additional burden for them.

This way, students drop out of the schools, which affects their academic life,"" said Shubhada Gudekar, chairperson of BMC education committee.

Ms Gudekar has asked the BMC education department to extend the primary as well as the secondary section from the academic year 2018-19, which will begin from June.

Along with this, several parents of the BMC school students complained to the department about lack of accountability when it comes to providing 27 items such as like bags, books, uniforms, stationery and shoes, which should be given at the beginning of the academic year but is not being done on time. This causes parents to shift the child to privately managed schools.

"4075","","Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], Feb 9 (ANI-NewsVoir): At the recently held Raisina Dialogue in New Delhi, the Minister of State for Urban Development and Housing Affairs Hardeep Singh Puri used some telling statistics to highlight the enormity of the urban development challenge ahead of us.

One among those was that by 2030, 600 million Indians are expected to be living in cities which make building planned urban spaces as the most important problem for us all to solve at this stage of the Nations growth.

The challenges arising out of overpopulated and under planned cities are felt by all of us on an everyday basis. The air quality situation in cities across the country, unmanageable floods in Mumbai last August and the disappearing lakes in our cities are just a few horrific reminders.

However, the solutions to better and smarter urbanisation are not just to go about building more cities or to keep increasing the capacity of existing mega cities but ultimately lie in creating a framework for a harmonious balance between natural environs and all the citizens of the city in an inclusive manner. Along with the initiatives the government is taking, this needs collective re-imagination and action from communities in our cities.

This mammoth task can no more be residual dinner table conversation if we want the very food on that table to be healthy and nutrient and not highly intoxicated due to extreme pollution levels in air and groundwater. So many questions arise then - How can we reimagine our cities?

Worldview Education, a Hyderabad born experiential learning focused organisation has designed an innovative long-term approach to precisely achieve this. Worldview believes that students and schools can be the big solution. Terming 'Schools as the Primary engines of Positive Change', Sampreeth Reddy, Managing Director of Worldview Education, said ""They have developed various experiential learning programs for students with an aim to trigger a curiosity and a creative thinking process in students to find solutions to the challenges we face in making our cities more sustainable.""

He further said ""schools converge large, diverse and powerful communities and also large tracts of land in congested cities. If they can reimagine themselves to be a microcosm of a smart city then we can achieve a positive 'acupuncture effect' through the very same communities that they converge. Schools across India seem to agree with this innovative approach and have been leading the way through participation in these programs. The management of some of these schools not only think that the future of our cities is in the hands of the cities young, they also think that these challenges across the world offer the biggest career opportunities for these students in the future.""

One such initiative called 'NatureTurks' addresses the issue at the absolute fundamental level - the absence of a relationship with nature or the lack of appreciation for it within the city, particularly among children who've grown up post the internet revolution. Through 4-6 days interventions that are carefully designed, students are immersed in the outdoors with a simple goal of building an appreciation for nature and to understand the reciprocal relationship that we share.

The mountains, rocks, star-studded night skies, trees, bees and butterflies turn facilitators of life lessons in a purpose-built campus set amidst the Nallamalla High range 120 km outside Hyderabad. Post the active intervention students are empowered and encouraged to take action within their zones of immediate influences however small they may be - confines of their homes, communities and schools.

For the ones who are ready to travel the distance there is the 'FutureSake' initiative where students get a unique opportunity to study some of the best case practices of sustainable urbanisation in Singapore or San Fransisco before they get started with their projects. As part of FutureSake, the students conduct an environmental audit of their local realities before they set out on an expedition to discover the very latest in smart city making. The focus of this week to ten-day trips is to understand the key building blocks of a city - energy, water, waste, biodiversity, land use and mobility.

From lobbying with the management to go solar, to creating awareness campaigns within the rest of the school students about simple and easily implementable solutions such as waste-segregation, water conservation to actually running projects in the school to grow food, plant trees or create harvesting pits; these sustainability champions are already taking positive action in their own little way.

Irrespective of the immediate success of these actions, the long-term impact is in these students embracing sustainable living practices, developing a culture of working on community problems and actively engaging in their city development.

The son of migrants from Pakistan, Umesh Malhotra had never been to a village before. A graduate from IIT Madras, he started his career with Infosys and was among the first hundred employees of the company. A few years later, a friend took him on a trip to the hinterlands of Rajasthan. There, he found himself sitting before a group of about 10 women, their faces hidden under long ghoonghats, but very vocal about the dismal state of education for their children in the villages.

"4080","","""If we pledge to impart primary education to our children in Konkani -- the language that possesses the best textbooks -- I can say for certain, no school in Marathi, Portuguese or English will ever survive in Goa. All primary schools in Goa will then run in Konkani.""

That was the vision held aloft by the late Ravindra Kelekar, a stalwart of modern Konkani literature, through his presidential address at the Akhil Bhartiya Konkani Sahitya Sammelan held in Panaji on November 16-17, 1969.

His sense of conviction about the success of Konkani in primary education emanated from the superlative quality of textbooks prepared by Konkani-lovers, through their labour of love post-liberation, after the then government of free Goa gave its nod for Konkani to be taught in primary schools.

""When the question of primary schools first arose in Goa after it gained Swaraj, some of us Konkani lovers insisted that Konkani should definitely go into primary education. There weren't any Konkani textbooks then, and hardly any other books as well in Konkani. Besides, we had no experience at all of what would be the fate of the students taking education in Konkani. But we knew of just one principle too well -- that a child should be imparted education only in its own language, that the Goa government should accept this universally acknowledged principle...,"" Kelekar explained in his address.

He went on to say that for children studying in Konkani, the benefits are three-fold -- there's a phenomenal rise in their grasping power, there's substantial increase in their thirst for knowledge, and they gain immense potential for self-expression.

""If you want Goa's children to be educated in the real sense of the term, then don't cede Konkani's space to any other language -- no matter how mighty the language is or how dire the need be.""

That was exactly 49 years ago.

Three decades before that, the first Konkani Parishad held in 1939, through several resolutions passed at the conference, had called upon the government to make provision for imparting primary education through the medium of Konkani in Devanagiri script.

Since then, the issue has been passionately discussed and debated at forums of the Parishad, but the dream of Konkani getting the dominant space in primary education in Goa has remained only a distant dream. The Konkani movement suffered a major setback when in 2011 the state government changed its policy to extend grants to English medium primary schools, and subsequently in 2017 when the BJP-led government failed to reverse the policy, despite vehement protests from the Konkani brigade.

""For Konkani, the major jolt is the shift in the medium of instruction,"" says Damodar Mauzo. ""People prefer to send their wards for primary education to either Marathi medium or the English. Marathi because it has been a tradition, and English because it is trendy. Masses that follow the classes blindly believe that their wards will immensely benefit by this shift, not realising that the ward will never master the 'other' language.""

The Sahitya Akademi award winner attempts to feel the pulse of the younger generation which has drifted away from Konkani. ""Goa is fast turning into a city state with its fast paced urbanisation. The common dream of the youth is to go abroad or aboard ship. Greener pastures woo them and hence, they feel no need of the proficiency in Konkani. In view of this confusing situation, the second-generation classes are seen moving away from the language of the soil. The masses are seen blindly following the classes that are in favour of English in public and at home.""

The debate now veers to the role of various Konkani institutions in the state in their task of turning the tide. Have they done enough to hold aloft Kelekar's vision of Konkani education before the masses? Despite starkly contrasting views, Konkani intelligentsia agree on one count -- that they have miles to go before the goal is reached.

A graduate from IIT Madras, he started his career with Infosys and was among the first hundred employees of the company. A few years later, a friend took him on a trip to the hinterlands of Rajasthan. There, he found himself sitting before a group of about 10 women, their faces hidden under long ghoonghats, but very vocal about the dismal state of education for their children in the villages.

That is when Umesh changed gears after a good many years in IT, and began his first foray into preschool learning. Starting with one school, 10 children and one teacher, within a year the strength went up to 80 children and three teachers. In 2011, he set up Hippocampus learning centres with the aim of providing quality education to rural children from low income families.

Suhai hails from a lower middle-class family of Bhai Khan Talpur village in Tando Muhammad Khan district of Sindh province. She joined the police force after clearing the elite Central Superior Services (CSS) exam in 2013, The Express Tribune reported.

""When my parents decided to enroll me at a school, most of our relatives started taunting my family. So much so, that my family had to leave our village and move to a nearby town,"" she told the daily.

Her father Aziz Talpur, a political activist and writer, always dreamt big for his daughter.

""My relatives cut off ties with me because I wanted Suhai to study as they were only in favour of religious education,"" Aziz told the daily. ""But I vowed to provide my daughter quality education.""

Suhai started her primary education at a private school in Tando Muhammad Khan and joined Bahria Foundation for her intermediate studies.

Her educational path then led her to pursue BCom from the Zubaida Girls College, Hyderabad in Sindh province.

""My family wanted me to become a chartered accountant but I found the job to be very dull as it had no social value,"" she said. ""That is when I appeared for CSS and cleared it in the first attempt.""

She credited her success to hard work and her upbringing. ""My parents are nationalists. As a child, they used to emphasise that I memorise Sindhi poetry. This developed my interest in literature and history, leading me to secure top marks in both the subjects in the CSS exams.""

Parents of wards who are enrolled at St. Joseph's School Baramulla told Rising Kashmir said that the missionary school Baramulla was resorting to the restrictive trade practice by keeping the booklist available at a single book shop and looting the common masses.

""We were forced to buy the school books and stationery at one single shop. We were getting same books at lower rates at other shops but school management had made it mandatory for us to buy books from the particular bookshop,"" said Altaf Ahmad, a resident of Baramulla.

Following consumer complaint against the school management, a team of Legal Metrology Department headed by the Assistant Controller Baramulla conducted an inspection of the Saint Joseph's School and the Valley Book Shop in Baramulla for verifying the contents of the consumer complaint.

Officials at Legal Metrology department Baramulla said that during the inspection, it was found that the school management had flashed an SMS to the guardians of students informing them that the books will remain available from a particular book shop.

"4107","","Students of private English-medium schools across Rajasthan will take a pledge to persuade their parents, guardians and family members to vote in the state assembly elections scheduled for December 7.

State chief electoral officer Anand Kumar has asked district electoral officers (DEOs) to get letters of pledge signed by the students, especially of private schools in cities and towns, so that the voting percentage increases in urban areas.

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said.","Private school students across Rajasthan to sign pledge asking parents to vote in assembly elections","986670404","2018-11-05","https://www.hindustantimes.com/rajasthan-elections/private-school-students-across-rajasthan-to-nudge-parents-to-vote-in-assembly-elections/story-QMYZtJNevctricHnw1LD6O.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE

Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Rajneesh Gupta said that Suresh was booked for rape under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code and under provisions of the POCSO Act. Police are also verifying if the accused has any past cases against him.

Advocate Aruna Negi Chauhan wrote a letter on behalf of the girl's parents to Uttarakhand Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat and Education Minister Arvind Pandey urging them to take ""strict legal action"" against the institution.

Chairman cum district principal judge G Mahizhenthi, asked the officials to submit a report on November 1. The authority has taken the measure following a surprise check on the premises of Gandhi International Matriculation Higher Secondary School at Mangalam near Arni on Saturday last.

Authorities were shocked over the hazardous environment on the school premises. The school was functioning from under construction buildings - three and five storey buildings - on either side of the highway between Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram.

The school lacked basic amenities. ""There is no latrine or restroom for students in the school that has 1,300 students from primary class to Class XII,"" secretary and sub-judge K Rajmohan told TOI.

The constituent committee of the DLSA has initiated the proceedings under Section 9 of the Legal Service Authority Act 1987. ""We have instructed the CEO to transfer the students to nearby schools to continue their studies,"" said Rajmohan.

Citing the Supreme Court direction and the Tamil Nadu Private School (regulation) Act 2018, which speaks about the safety of the children in schools, Rajmohan said the private school at Mangalam had been functioning in violation of the Act and the SC's direction.

""We have asked the authorities -- from the CEO to police -- who should ensure that all the safety norms are being followed by the institution to submit a detailed report on action taken in this perspective,"" he added.

Kumar, against whom a few managers have raised the war cry, had earned all-round appreciation from students and parents across the state after he proactively intervened and stopped unhealthy practices that were going on unchecked in CBSE schools.

Recently, an 'unanimous resolution' on the letterhead of the Kerala CBSE School Management Association was submitted as a memorandum to Kumar and a copy was sent to member schools. The association has around 1,400 schools as members.

Signed by association president T P M Ibrahim Khan, the 'resolution' listed out recent 'actions' of Kumar which, if repeated, ""would adversely affect even the existence of CBSE schools in the state.""

The 'resolution' also interpreted actions taken by Kumar as ""creating havoc among schools, especially in Muslim minority schools.""

It said the RO's orders had ""created disappointment among the minority community.""

'Resolution unauthorised'

Ironically, the association's general secretary and working president have come out against the 'resolution'. Sources said they had asked the president (Ibrahim) why such a 'resolution' was prepared without the executive committee's authorisation.

Meanwhile, three of the four schools run by minority community managements, listed as 'aggrieved parties', are understood to have objected to the 'resolution'. It is learnt schools which distanced themselves from the resolution were opposed to being used as pawns to build a case against Kumar, who has an impeccable track record.

Strong action

Kumar had created a flutter when he inspected a school in Kollam based on widespread complaints. He proceeded fine the school Rs 2 lakh - the highest ever in the country - for poor infrastructure, unsafe classrooms and several other unfair practices.

Kumar's intervention ended several unfair practices by schools such as collection of huge amounts as 'development fee', charging fees for issuing transfer certificates, collecting 'caution deposit' from teachers, overcharging students for textbooks and conducting unauthorised exams.

Kumar ruffled a few feathers when he took action against a prominent school in the capital for conducting entrance coaching classes outside the school premises but promoting it on its official website. He also cracked the whip on an unauthorised association of school managements from the minority community which fleeced students and compelled them to attend 'talent search exams' having communally divisive content.

THE 'CHARGES'

■ Conducted inspections, created 'terror' in schools

■ Undermined the existence of CBSE schools

■ Created 'havoc' in Muslim minority schools

""If you visit any private school in the state after 10 am, there will be pin-drop silence and kids will be waiting for the day to get over and fly like free birds. As the teachers at private schools are like nuns, serious and more disciplined, kids will also be serious and seriousness kills creativity,"" Mahesh said.

Comparing government and private school teachers, the minister said, ""100% of our government school teachers are more intelligent than teachers at private schools. The only problem is of co-ordination between teachers and students which is not happening and if that happens, our government school kids will overtake private school kids,"" the minister said.

The minister then likened private school children to parrots and government school kids to eagles. ""Private school kids will become parrots and government school kids eagles. Parrots just do what they are asked to do. But government school kids fight for their rights by discussing and fighting with teachers. According to me, those who are naughty in the classroom are intelligent and not the ones who just listen to everything in the class,"" he said.

According to the minister, those who studied at private schools will not pay back to society and they will only look for job opportunities abroad. ""Our government school kids will remain in the state, even if they become a teacher, constable or driver. They will give back to the society by staying here,"" he added.

private schools condemn comment

The statements by the minister were condemned by private school managements. The managements even demanded the minister's resignation for what they termed as ""irresponsible"" statements and for violating rights of the children by discriminating between government and private school kids. D Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said, ""How can the minister give such immature and irresponsible statements? e demand that the minister step down.""","Minister N Mahes calls private school teachers nuns, kids parrots","957824669","2018-09-29","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/2018/sep/30/minister-n-mahes-calls-private-school-teachers-nuns-kids-parrots-1879091.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"4122","","In a bid to boost road safety, the district administration will run a special campaign to issue challans (fines) to private van operators who flout rules while ferrying school children. The decision was taken in a meeting on road safety, chaired by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, on Wednesday.

""Overloaded vans put children's lives at risk. We will not allow private vans to carry more children than the subscribed limit. We will run a special campaign to challan private van operators who flout the rules,"" Munish Sharma, additional deputy commissioner, said.

In line with its Surakshit Vahan Policy, there are committees at the state-, district- and sub-district levels that have laid down rules for ensuring safety of schoolchildren.

As per the policy, vehicles engaged in carrying schoolchildren cannot ferry children in excess of 1.5 times the vehicle's registered seating capacity. However, poor implementation of rules and lax monitoring has failed to keep a check on accidents involving these vans.

Sharma said 50 private van drivers of different schools had been issued a ticket by the Regional Traffic Authority in September alone.

The administration has also directed all schools to keep a record of details of vendors who ferry children. Information such as the driver's name, mobile number and number of children being ferried should be made available, the rules stipulate.

Sharma informed that the administration was keeping a check on underage drivers. ACP, traffic Hawa Singh , who was also present in the meeting, said that in the last three months, 135 fines were issued for underage driving in the district.

""We have told all schools to ensure that children do not travel in vans that are crammed beyond capacity. Schools have also been told to check if students are riding bikes or driving cars in contravention of rules. We will keep a strict check on underage driving,"" Premlata Yadav, district elementary education officer, said.","Gurugram administration to crack down on errant private school van drivers","955626614","2018-09-26","https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/gurugram-administration-to-crack-down-on-errant-private-school-van-drivers/story-PNA69SrAKnmWTtJhKj5CFN.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"4123","","'When you leave home in formals, you send a message that you are not on strike which hurts the sentiments of those who are on strike'

Srinagar: While it seems the General Administration Department is trying to make strike calls 'a failure' by installing Bio-metric Systems in government offices in Jammu and Kashmir, some private educational institutions are also pressing the employees to reach offices on strike days, jeopardizing their lives.

However, the school admins deny the allegations saying the staff 'enjoys' holiday on a strike day.

Kashmir, which is caught up in a conflict as both India and Pakistan claim the territory and have fought three wars over it. In order to protest the 'atrocities of the Indian armed forces', the Joint Resistance Leadership, calls for shutdowns and strikes in order to send out a message to the world that everything is not right in the valley.

On strike days, the business and offices are supposed to come to a halt for the said dates. It only incurs losses to Kashmir and education is also a sector that suffers grossly. At present, on strike days, the educational institutions send text messages to parents asking them to keep their wards at home. However, the staff members are asked to come to the school.

""Whatever be the case, we are supposed to go. The authorities would try to keep us engaged with paperwork but we would really face hardships in order to mark the attendance,"" says a former teacher from a private institution located in Pulwama. On condition of keeping his and the school's identity anonymous, he also told Free Press Kashmir that the school would force the local teachers to come to the school and make them sign a contract so they don't claim the salary for the vacation time.

""On the days when we work, we work enough to deserve the salary while the school is shut. The contract they would make us sign would remain with them. Asking for salary or not coming on strike days meant termination,"" he says adding that he resigned from the school.

The teachers from Srinagar would be allowed to stay back home while the local teachers from the 'always on boil' Pulwama would be asked to attend the school with no students to teach.

""Pulwama is the area that is not safe to travel. When you leave home in formals, you send a message that you are not on strike which hurts the sentiments of those who are on strike. This is something that the school doesn't consider. We literally risk our lives for peanuts,"" says the tutor.

Moreover, teachers from Urban areas complain about the same, saying that they ought to attend the school despite all odds. While talking to FPK, a faculty member from Oasis Educational Institute said that the administration calls them to school even if they have to kill time just by sitting there.

""The students are sitting at home and we are asked to come. We keep sitting for the day but we are not allowed to stay back home. This not only puts our lives at risk but also frustrates us,"" said the member. The school authorities did not respond to the calls on the contact number provided on their website.

Another institute, International Islamic School (IIS) also follows the same line when it comes to going against the strike calls.

""The staff would not be allowed to leave early on Fridays, not to talk of the strike days. Even today, it follows the same lines,"" says a former employee from IIS.

While in rural areas, the authorities threaten the employees out loud, here in Srinagar the authorities deny all the allegations.

""The staff doesn't come on strike days. They enjoy the holiday at their home. In fact, we pay them for that day too,"" said the Public Relations Officer of IIS.

""When the call for the strike is not so serious, we do come to the school. On that day, we work on the maintenance of registers, hold meetings, check and update the syllabus, make activity reports. There is always something we get to work on,"" says Khawaja Irfan, a +2 lecturer from Tyndale Biscoe School, Srinagar.

""Even on days when we don't have much to do, we play matches and the time passes. On strict strike call days, we are asked to stay home but the non-teaching staff is supposed to come, come what may,"" Ifran says.

An official from the school told FPK that ""it doesn't matter to the non-teaching staff whether there is a strike or not.""

""We have nothing to do with the children. We have official work and that is what we are supposed to do even when there are strikes. So, we come,"" he says, wishing to remain anonymous.

"4124","","KOZHIKODE: You would be shelling out anywhere between Rs 14,000 and Rs 30,000 or even more every year as fees if your child happens to be studying in an unaided school.

What if it hikes the fees mid-year upsetting your already tight budget? No use protesting as schools have all the right to do so, if recent judicial pronouncements are anything to go by. ""There's no statutory prohibition for a management to fix a particular fee for an academic year and there's no guideline issued by the CBSE as to how the fee structure should be maintained,"" ruled the High Court recently.

This was in connection with a case in which parents protested the sudden fee hike by a CBSE-affiliated school in Ernakulam. The CBSE regional office has come across instances in which some affiliated schools in the state were found to have collected as many as 20 different types of fees.These included 'Computer Fee' from four-year-old LKG students and fees for conducting talent search exams of private agencies from all students.

CBSE school management representatives played down fleecing instances as 'isolated cases'. ""Most of the CBSE-affiliated schools are charging fees according to the facilities provided to students. It's unfair to cite a few cases and say that all CBSE schools are fleecing students,"" said Kerala CBSE School Management Association general secretary Indira Rajan.

However, frequent complaints on the part of parents have put the spotlight on the need to set up a fee regulatory body for unaided schools on the lines of self-financing professional colleges. Already, states such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam have enacted laws regulating the fee structure of private schools.

Government cites helplessness

""The state government had imposed certain stringent conditions as a prerequisite for granting of NOC to unaided schools with a view to bring in some sort of regulation over such institutions. But the move was turned down by the Supreme court,"" said General Education Secretary A Shajahan.However, the government's sincerity in the matter has been questioned by certain quarters.

""The government is maintaining criminal silence on the issue and has given unaided schools a free hand. If the government has any sincerity, it should urgently bring in a regulatory mechanism to prevent fleecing of students. But that requires strong political will,"" opined education rights activist M Shajarkhan.","No guideline to maintain private school fee structure","952645630","2018-09-22","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/sep/23/no-guideline-to-maintain-private-school-fee-structure-1875899.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"4125","","GURUGRAM: At least 2,000 students have switched to government schools from private schools in Gurgaon district this session, according to the district elementary education officer. This has happened on account of various reasons, including affordability. Students who have transferred claimed that government schools were providing almost all facilities available in private schools at much lower costs.

Annual fee hike in private schools was cited as one of the key reasons for which students turned to government schools. Jyoti Kumari, who studies in Class VI and has come from Divya Vidya Niketan School, Mohammadpur, said, ""My parents put me in a government school because in private schools, the fee is hiked every year.""

Besides, she said, government school teachers gave more attention to students. ""Teachers give us extra time and attention -- we are sometimes called to school during holidays to study -- which is not the case in private schools,"" said Kumari.

A wide range of books in the school library and bigger playgrounds were other reasons that students, who have transferred to government schools, cited as positives. Nitish Verma, a Class VI student who has joined Government Senior Secondary School, Jharsa, from Shiv Public Senior Secondary School, Sohna, said, ""The library here is far better -- we have all types of books.""

Sachin Khatana, a Class X student of Government Senior Secondary School, Abheypur, said, ""I had been studying in New Shaheed Smarak Public School, Abheypur, since kindergarten. The school didn't have facilities such as a proper playground or co-circular activities for students.

"4129","","Surge in number of students travelling in unsafe modes of private transport including autorickshaws can be directly

attributed to a significant drop in the number of buses or vans

operated by educational institutions.

The number of newly-registered school and college buses has halved in the past five years and an increasing number of institutions are shying away from adding new vehicles to their existing fleet.

Of late, some schools have reduced the frequency of existing buses and merged routes.

Also, more than 6,400 school buses have been booked for overloading in the past three years.

School managements defended reduction of bus services saying they did not want to take the 'extra risk' and the amount collected as bus fee from parents was not covering the cost of maintaining vehicles.

Schools said it was difficult to meet the criteria set by the special cell -- which comprises transport, education and police departments -- that inspects and renews fitness certificates of buses.

""Parents want school buses to drop their wards at their doorsteps and quarrel with us if we try to merge bus stops or take a longer route due to practical constraints,"" said R Vishalakshi, president of the Tamil Nadu Private Matriculation Schools Association.

""Share autos and cabs pick them up and drop them at a lesser cost. So, parents prefer these modes of transport over school buses,"" she added.

"4135","","Snapshot

Tough regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools must be eased as soon as possible.

Can launching 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings improve the situation?

The Narendra Modi government is seized of the importance of ensuring the ease of doing business in the country and rightly so. Since 2015, it has taken a series of concerted reforms to climb on the World Bank's annual rankings. The country's big jump from 142 to 100 in just three years is testament to the government's efforts.

A similar if not more urgent initiative is required in facilitating the ease of opening and running a private, unaided school. Though many may frown upon labelling education as a business, but this is all the more reason to show urgency in liberalising the norms and regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools. As India's middle class is expanding, millions of children are leaving government schools and opting for private ones. With time, this trend is likely to get stronger as more and more parents become financially empowered enough to afford private schools.

However, since the passage of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, ease of opening and running a school has become a nightmare.

On the digital and print pages of Swarajya, this writer and others have spilled enough ink detailing the ills ailing the RTE Act. We have repeatedly criticised the policy of keeping minorities out of ambit of the act in toto; important sections like number 12 that mandates 25 per cent quota for students from disadvantaged groups/weaker sections in private unaided non-minority schools; section 13 that bars any kind of screening for admitting students; section 16 which allows mandatory promotion to the next class irrespective of the performance and learning; and so on.

However, one important aspect of the act that has escaped the much needed scrutiny is the set of regulations surrounding the recognition of a school which is the fundamental requirement to run a school. Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE deal with rules and restrictions in this regard.

These state that no private school shall be established or run without obtaining a certificate of recognition from the appropriate government authority on fulfilling certain norms and standards as laid out in Schedule in such form and manner, within such period, and subject to such conditions as laid out in rule 11 and rule 12 of ""Model Rules Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

What are the norms and standards set out in the Schedule? First, the minimum number of teachers a school must have from classes I to VIII depending on the strength of the class. Second, the building requirements (kitchen, playground, number of classrooms, etc). Third, minimum number of working days in a year. Fourth, minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher. Fifth, use of teaching aid for each class. Sixth, library. Seventh, play material, games, and sports equipment.

What do the rule 11 and 12 of Model Rules say? After conforming to the above norms, every school has to fill out Form 1 declaring that:

the school is run by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force;the school is not run for profit to any individual, group or association of individuals or any other persons;the school conforms to the values enshrined in the Constitutionthe school buildings or other structures or the grounds are used only for the purposes of education and skill development;the school is open to inspection by any officer authorised by the state government/local authority;the school furnishes such reports and information as may be required by the Director of Education/District Education Officer from time to time and complies with such instructions of the state government/local authority as may be issued to secure the continued fulfillment of the condition of recognition or the removal of deficiencies in working of the school

Apart from these, there are eight tables of details to be filled in Form 1 such as:

Then the District Education Officer (DEO) carries out an inspection to see if the requirements have been met and give the certificate of recognition. However, it is temporary, to be renewed every three years and is only for primary classes i.e. up to standard VIII. For higher classes, there are separate, and similarly, those who run schools without obtaining a certificate of recognition can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 per day.

As if these onerous requirements, especially the ones highlighted, were not enough, it is pertinent to note that these are merely those mandated by the central act. The states have their own, additional level of requirements. Most prominent of these is 'Essentiality certificate"" aka the 'no objection certificate' awarded by the state government's Department of Education for five years.

Even by-laws of central boards like the CBSE insist on this prized possession as preliminary necessity before giving affiliation to schools. On top of all this, there are permissions and plans - building, health, water, land use permitted, etc - to be sought from municipality.

The situation is so bad that even elite schools with decades of reputation of delivering great service and education have to face extreme levels of bureaucratic red-tapism. Sachin Tendulkar's school Shardashram Vidyamandir wanted to amend affiliation board from SSC to ICSE for Class 1 to Class IV and also wanted to change its name. Both the requests were dismissed by BMC officials stating that it has given NOC for SSC board till 2020 so it must continue with the same.

If this is the condition for established players who can be treated in such a manner by a municipal corporation, one can imagine what effect they will have on genuine players willing to enter the field. The regulations can induce bouts of trauma into even the most spirited of edupreneurs.

The language of the RTE Act and other rules indicates that the State is more concerned with reigning in the growth of private schools than facilitating right to education for everyone in reality.

While the regulations provide for elaborate monetary punishments which can even lead to closure of the school for not getting the recognition, there is hardly anything about the government's laxity in giving the certificates. The Haryana government is yet to grant recognition for around 3,200 private schools operating since 2003 in the state. Without recognition they can't even apply to the Haryana board for affiliation. Wonder why no act penalises the government, say Rs 10,000 per day per school, for each day's delay in granting recognition (or rejecting it as the case may be)? Even if these schools are given recognition, it will only be for a year. The situation is similar in Odisha and Kerala too. The future of thousands of schools in the country, year after year, depends on government's arbitrary decisions.

Also, the government can announce any new set of arbitrary conditions as the Uttar Pradesh government did recently when it made it mandatory for all schools to install CCTVs and biometric machines for attendance to seek recognition from the UP board.

And if the schools protest, the government can pass an order ruling that agitating against the government can lead to withdrawal of recognition as the Chandigarh education department did this year.

Such a regime is bad enough for any business. It's disastrous and suicidal to have it in private education sector which is the only hope left for the lower middle class and poor to climb up the social and economic ladder. Every day we continue with this system, we are inflicting great damage to the students from the lower strata of our populace who are highly disproportionately enrolled in the failed government schools. In its zeal to put a leash on private schools in the name of curbing profiteering, what the government has achieved is monopoly of those who are now experts at gaming the system through underhanded ways and means. The genuine educationists and philanthropists dare not enter the market.

What can the Modi government do? For starters, it can launch national 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings. Second, it can reform the norms and procedures needed for recognition mentioned in the schedule at the back of the RTE Act.

To realise the goal of universal quality education, which is affordable too, the state must facilitate proliferation of private schools leading to competition.

"4137","","CHENNAI: A private school has come up on the banks of the Adyar river, just metres away from where excess water released from the Chembarambakkam lake entered Thiruneermalai in December 2015 before rushing on to flood the Tambaram area. As the monsoon is not far away, local people allege the school is flirting with danger and risking the lives of its students by operating in a high-risk flood zone.

""The school is situated at the junction where an outlet channel of the Chembarambakkam lake and the Adyar river meet. This means if water is released from the lake, the school will be the first building to be hit,"" said O Udayakumar, a resident of Thiruneermalai.

According to locals, the entire area right upto the base of the nearby hill, which is, at least, one km from the school, was submerged in water upto the first floor of several buildings during the 2015 floods.

This means a repeat could completely submerge the school which is just a stone's throw away from the Adyar river and the Chembarambakkam water channel.

Interestingly, the school seems to have sacrificed 'safety for the aesthetics'.

The school buildings have been constructed right next to the river bank instead of the other extremity, which would allow some breathing space in case of emergency, though disallowing the picturesque view it boasts of now.

Though construction works were completed last year, this primary school began functioning only two months ago with a strength of 50 students and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

When Express contacted the school's management over the issue, they downplayed the risks the school faces from flooding. ""We have raised the floor two metres and will build a four-metre compound wall,"" said an official, claiming the school's basement has been sealed as a safety measure.

However, locals, who witnessed the flooding in 2015, said that no wall would stand a chance of fighting the raging water.

""Everyone just remembers 2015 because it is the most recent incident of flooding. At least, once in five years, there is flooding. It is more common than people think,"" said Udayakumar, adding that the monsoon doesn't even have to be as bad as 2015 to cause flooding.","Private school comes up in high-risk flood zone, raises concern","930802368","2018-08-23","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2018/aug/24/private-school-comes-up-in-high-risk-flood-zone-raises-concern-1861967.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"4142","","SAHARANPUR: Throwing state government claims over improvement in law and order to the wind, unidentified miscreants abducted and murdered the principal of a convent school as his family failed to arrange Rs 2 lakh to pay ransom in Saharanpur district on Friday. Surprisingly, cocking a snook at police bandobast, the abductors committed the crime right under the nose of police and security personnel who were deployed in huge numbers in Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar range due to the ongoing 'Kanwar Yatra' in the holy month of Shravan.

According to Badgaon police SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the Principal and owner of Paramount Convent School, Subhash Kashyap was abducted by four unidentified persons while he was on his way back home to his village Balu Mazra on a motorcycle at around 9 pm on Thursday. When he did not return home till late into the night, his family launched a search.

In the meantime, the family got a call from the mobile of the abducted principal. An unknown person was speaking and he told the family that the principal was abducted and he would be killed if they did not pay a ransom of Rs 2 lakh for securing his release.

The principal's family, in a state of shock and panic, rushed to Badgaon Police Station to lodge an FIR after receiving the ransom call. As per SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the mobile number was put on electronic surveillance and a search operation was immediately launched. The location of the mobile number was traced to Monga jungles on Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur border, said the SHO. He added that the police party deputed to search the abducted principal stumbled upon his bullet-riddled body from the same location on as early as 4 am on Friday.

However, the cops were wondering why the perpetrators did not wait for ransom and killed the principal within six hours of making the call to his family. ""Possibly, the principal had recognised the abductors who could be from the same village or his acquaintances,"" said a senior police official of the district.

On Sunday, the victim K Krithiga (28), teacher in a private school, has sustained labour pain. However, she was not rushed to any of the hospitals over there. With love for natural medicine, Krithiga's husband Karthikeyan and their friends Praveen and Lavanya have assisted the pregnant women in giving birth in a natural way at their home.

Nevertheless, none of the three persons was medically qualified. ""All the three have only learnt it by watching videos in YouTube,"" said a police official. According to sources, on Sunday after delivering a baby, Krithiga went unconscious as she lost lot of blood in the placental bleed. Soon she was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.

The incident became known only after they took the body to Tirupur Government Hospital, where the doctors sought for a medical certificate from them. As the family members did not have any medical certificate, they lodged a formal complaint in the Nallur police, who have filed a case of suspicious death and are probing into the matter.

"4151","","If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country.

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education.","Capping private school fees a bad idea - Here is why","909646102","2018-07-20","https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/capping-private-school-fees-a-bad-idea-here-is-why/1252666/","The Financial Express",FALSE

They also want a national permit for tourist buses. The All India Confederation of Goods Vehicle Owners Association (ACOGOA) had called a strike on the same issues on June 18, but received poor response.

The forum said that about 12,000 schools, including the ones under Central Board of Secondary Education, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education and other boards across Telangana, will participate in the protest.

""Almost all the student, teacher and welfare organisations have extended support to our bandh call. Most of the political parties too will be supporting us. From play schools to corporate schools, all schools will remain closed on July 18,"" said Shabir Ali, TPTF president.

""Despite working hard to improve the quality of education in the state, there is no one to look after our welfare. Even after submitting multiple requests, we are being paid only for 10 months instead of

"4156","","A particularly harsh punishment was doled out to 16 kindergarten students in a private girls' school in for not paying the fees. The children were apparently locked up in a dingy basement for five hours.

The incident occurred at in Delhi's area on Monday. According to a report in the Times Of India, when parents of these little girls went to pick them up, they were not in their classroom. Upon inquiry, they were told that they were in the basement and had not been allowed to attend class since they had not paid the fees.

The parents rushed to the basement and found the kids locked in a room that had been bolted from the outside. The parents alleged that their daughters were left in the poorly ventilated room that didn't even have a fan in this blistering Delhi heat for five hours (7.30AM to 12.30PM). Shabeem Hasan, a complainant, also said that a few kids had to be taken to the hospital.

The principal, Farah Diba, however, denied the allegation and told ANI that the room was a ""recreation room"" and that the fan had gone for repairs that day. She also claimed that the children were kept under the supervision of two teachers. However, the children told the police that there were no teachers in the room.

Parents also claimed that they had, in fact, paid the fees and even had receipts, but school authorities said they had no way of knowing the fees had been paid as the teachers had not been given the 'slips' that would confirm the same.

An FIR was lodged at the Hauz Qazi police station later on Monday for illegal confinement under Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights has also reportedly set up an inquiry.

"4158","","Safety and security of students, protecting them from sexual abuse, guarding the rights of children who perform poorly in academics are among the key features of a new Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly.

Safety and security of students, protecting them from sexual abuse, guarding the rights of children who perform poorly in academics are among the key features of a new Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Aimed at regulating private schools, the bill has been welcomed by parents and educationists alike. Wilful non-compliance of such mandatory features could attract imprisonment of up to a year or a fine that could go up to Rs five lakh or both.

The Tamil Nadu Private Schools (Regulation) Bill, 2018 was adopted by the assembly on July 5. It is aimed at ensuring aspects including assurance of quality education, collection of fair fee and proper conduct of examinations. ""No private school shall prevent any pupil on its rolls from appearing for any board examinations on account of poor academic performance,"" says Section 22 (3) of the Act.

Non-compliance may invite one year imprisonment or Rs five lakh fine or both. ""It is significant as some schools in the state have the practise of not allowing poor performers to sit for board examinations,"" said a parent, P Ravikumar.

All schools now have the mandate to ensure the ""safety and security of students including protection from mental harassment or physical injury or sexual abuse,"" as per sections 20 (1) and (2). ""These provisions are timely and laudable,"" said another parent S Arun, listing out several allegations of sexual abuse by teachers.

Given accidents like the recent death of a nine-year old girl after she fell from the fourth floor of her school in Chennai and some teachers allegedly resorting to corporal punishment, the new provisions will help prevent them, he said. General Secretary, State Platform for Common School System-Tamil Nadu, P B Prince Gajendra Babu, welcoming the law said a robust mechanism should, however, be put in place to implement the Act.

""There should be a transparent mechanism in every educational district to register complaints of students and parents,"" he told PTI. He said measures ""should be in place to ensure that nobody including teachers are victimised and justice rendered to all.""

He said the focus on ending unhealthy competition among private schools and stress on fair fee collection are praiseworthy. According to section 26, which reaffirms a 2009 Tamil Nadu Act, ""no school shall collect any charge...except the fee fixed by the Fee Determination Committee.""

Against the background of incidents like a student's recent death here after he was allegedly punished by making him to do ""duck walk"" by a physical trainer, the new law will help avert such incidents, the noted education activist said.

President, TN Private Schools Association, R Visalakshi too welcomed the law saying it will provide an impetus to schools in their endeavour to provide quality education. ""It will be helpful for promoters of new schools as well,"" she said.

Referring to sub-clause 7 of Section 8 that ""no child shall be admitted in any school which has not been recognised,"" she said a list of recognised schools should be publicised by the government. If a child was admitted to an unrecognised school, it attracts a punishment of up to one year or a fine up to Rs five lakh or both (for the unrecognised institution).

""In the first place, no school without recognition should be allowed to admit students. An up-to-date list of recognised schools must be featured in the education department website,"" she said. Importance for a ""judicious mix of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities,"" and learning outcomes are among the other notable features of the new law.

The school Bill was adopted after an expert committee came up with a draft legislation which considered all relevant Acts, rules, codes and government orders in this regard. The law applies to all private -both aided and unaided-and will come into force on a date the government will notify.","Tamil Nadu Private Schools (Regulation) Bill, 2018: Law to protect school children from sexual abuse - Know details","901540370","2018-07-08","https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-private-schools-regulation-bill-2018-law-to-protect-school-children-from-sexual-abuse-know-details/1235975/","The Financial Express",FALSE

"4160","","While Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Saturday made a promise that the State government would correct the budget announcement and ensure that English is taught as a language and not used as medium of instruction, Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh appears keen to stick with the budgetary promise in letter and spirit.

In a chat with The Hindu, he said he was for opening English-medium sections in 1,000 government schools on an experimental basis to attract more students. Excerpts:

The State government's plan on opening English-medium sections in government primary schools has received a lot of criticism. Your thoughts on this?

We want to teach English as a language in all government schools. But we want to open one English-medium section in 1,000 government schools on a pilot basis. This is because government school enrolments are declining as private schools offer education in English. Take for instance a government school in my own village in Kollegal taluk. The school that had 200 students now has only around 40 as the parents, a majority of whom are daily wage labourers, want their children to study in English medium.

The decision of merging 28,847 government and aided schools with low admission rates with 8,530 nearby government schools too has faced criticism.

This point too needs to be clarified. We have identified 28,847 government and aided schools with low admissions. We will not merge all of them. Only around 8,000 of the total 28,847 schools will be merged with 8,530 government schools.

A delegation of writers, scholars, and academicians has threatened to stage a protest if English is used as medium of instruction. How will you deal with this issue?

There is no need for anyone to protest. I will meet all education experts and hold talks with them and clear their doubts. We will take all decisions democratically.

The previous Congress government had amended the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to make mother tongue the medium of instruction in primary classes. This budget announcement reverses that effort.

I will study it and then comment.","'Government school numbers down because private schools teach in English'","901296057","2018-07-07","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/government-school-numbers-down-because-private-schools-teach-in-english/article24362909.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"4162","","GURUGRAM: Parents of students who cleared the qualifying exam for admission to private schools for economically weaker sections (EWS) three months ago but didn't get seats, staged a protest in front of Gurugram deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh's residence on Thursday.

A total of 341 applicants had cleared the exam, which was conducted on April 15. While 220 students have secured seats, the remaining 121 haven't got admission. In Gurugram, 46 private schools admit students under the EWS quota.

On Thursday, parents gathered in front of the DC's house and staged a protest for three hours. Sant Lal, a protester who has applied for his son's admission in Class 2, said: ""I lost my job as I have been going from one office to another every single day, but my son still hasn't got admission. Don't poor people have the right to educate their kids in private schools?""

Later, district elementary education officer (DEEO) Prem Lata Yadav was called to appease the parents. The parents, however, said they didn't get any assurances from her.

""We told her about our grievances. She only said that the matter is being considered,"" said Jai Kumar, who is seeking admission for his daughter in Class 2. The parents now plan to hold a protest march from the DC office in Gurugram to Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi to make their demands heard.

Speaking on the issue, DEEO Yadav said, ""We've told parents that many cases are under investigation. The ones who have filed correct documents will get admission. Private schools have complained to us that many parents are seeking admissions despite not falling under EWS quota and that documents which they have submitted are wrong or fake. The investigation has not been completed yet.""

Meanwhile, private schools have said they've received many applications with fake documents and they won't give admission to any such applicant. Colonel Pratap Singh, senior vice-president of Haryana Progressive School's Conference (HPSC), Gurugram, and chairman, Colonel's Central Academy (CCA School), said: ""There are parents who have applied for admission of their children under EWS quota, who, we later found out, have air conditioners and cars at home. Private schools had got a nod from the deputy commissioner to do an internal investigation of applicants with incorrect or fake documents and submit the details to the education department, which most of the schools did. The DC had told us that he would look into the matter and in case schools don't hear from the DC's office by June 15, we are to assume that they are fake.""

Rule 134A of the Haryana School Education Rules makes it mandatory for private schools to reserve 10% seats for meritorious students belonging to the EWS category. Schools are supposed to charge fee from these students at the same rate as charged in government schools.

When approached by TOI, DC Vinay Pratap Singh said, ""I have asked the district elementary education officer to look into the matter.""","No private school seats for one-third of EWS quota applicants yet, parents fume - Times of India","900201393","2018-07-06","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/no-private-school-seats-for-one-third-of-ews-quota-applicants-yet-parents-fume/articleshow/64876740.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

""The management representatives of self-financed schools had suggested following the Uttar Pradesh's fee regulation rules where it states that the existing fee of schools should remain as it is and on this there should be an annual seven per cent hike.

""We suggested that these activities be considered integral part of the school and compulsory. This should not be optional.

While the mother was busy helping the boy to board the school van, Adhya came behind her crawling, which was noticed by the van driver. After the boy boarded the van, the driver started the bus, resulting in crushing Adhya under the wheels said the Shabad Police.

A case of causing death due to negligence was booked against the van driver and the school management. M Ravi Kumar, Sub Inspector Shabad Police station said that the school van though had all necessary permissions, it had no attender to take care of the kids.

Momula Chandrashekar Reddy and Lavanya, a farmer couple from Gopigadda village under Shabad Mandal, had two kids Satvik Reddy(4) and Adhya (21 months).

A week ago, Satwik was admitted to Sumedha Montessori School located at Shabad town in LKG. On Monday morning, when the school van no TS 07UA 0495 came to pick up the kids, Lavanya took Satvik to the van halted on the main road, located a few meters away in front of their house.

During the current academic year, 203 students have taken fresh admissions to classes 1-9 at the Government Model Higher Primary School taking its strength to 736, compared to last year's 534. This apart, the nursery opened at this school last year has seen its strength go up from 86 to 203 this year.

What's more surprising is the government school is giving several private schools in its vicinity a run for their money. At least 25 students from four private schools have joined the government school this year, a trend which is rare elsewhere. So much was the rush for admissions that the headmaster had to convince people of neighbouring villages to admit their wards to their nearby government schools.

The turnaround of the school is attributed to the improvement in the physical infrastructure and quality in teaching. Six months ago, Ajit Kumar Rai, an industrialist and an alumnus of the school donated a three-storey building worth Rs 1.25 crore to his alma mater. Many other alumni also joined him to contribute their might to the school.

As a result, the school acquired the characteristics of a private institution complete with school bus, computer and science laboratories, library and English speaking course and extra-currucular activities like karate, music and Bharatanatyam.

After a report in Pune Newsline highlighted how the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was indulging discriminatory practice vis-a-vis cash awards to SSC students from civic schools and private schools, the civic administration on Wednesday decided to tweak the rule and increase the prize money for meritorious students from private schools. Hundreds of meritorious students from private schools are expected to benefit from the move as now they will receive Rs one lakh instead of Rs 15,000, which was decided earlier.

On June 9, Pune Newsline had highlighted the fact that 18 PCMC-run school students who secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will get Rs one lakh cash reward while private school students within PCMC limits will get only Rs 15,000, a practice in force for past few years.

Civic activists had called for an end to this discriminatory practice. Taking note of the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad BJP president Laxman Jagtap, MLA had urged the civic administration and the standing committee to provide justice to private school students. As a result, a meeting by the standing committee was held on June 5, where it was announced that students from private schools who come under the below poverty line and have secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will also get Rs one lakh cash reward.

However, BJP leaders like city general secretary Sarang Kamtekar and PCMC House leader Eknath Pawar said they were in favour rewarding meritorious SSC students from economically weaker sections. ""PCMC should honour students who come from poor sections of the society and have secured more than 90 per cent marks. Like students who live in one room chawls, sons and daughters of autorickshaw drives and vegetable vendors,"" he said. Pawar said he too would take up the issue with the Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar.

When contacted, Hardikar said the idea was good and he would work out the budget for it. ""We will have to see how many students fall in the category and whether we are in a position to provide the funds. But the idea is good...we need to honour the poor and meritorious students,"" he said.

According to PCMC officials, last year over 1100 students from private schools had secured more than 90 per cent marks. ""These students included the poor as well as the rich,"" he said, adding that the figure of EWS students would be in the range of around 400. Officials said EWS families are those who monthly income is less than Rs 15,000.","Pune: SSC private school students from BPL scoring above 90%, set to get Rs 1L cash reward","890811460","2018-06-20","https://indianexpress.com/article/education/pune-ssc-private-school-students-from-bpl-scoring-above-90-set-to-get-rs-1l-cash-reward-5225930/","The Indian Express",FALSE

"4258","","In a first, two private schools in Noida have agreed to roll back hiked fees and return the excess to the parents, the district education department informed, after continued agitation by the parents' body against ""arbitrary fee hike"" by schools which was not in accordance with the UP school fee regulatory act.

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

"4259","","NEW DELHI: The kids aren't eating healthy: an inspection of at least 10 private schools in Delhi has revealed that these institutions don't have a canteen policy in place and, in most cases, the students are ""being given to eat what they ask for"". The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented.","Fat is in the fire: Delhi private schools found wanting on food safety - Times of India","1026578144","2018-12-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/fat-is-in-the-fire-private-schools-found-wanting-on-food-safety/articleshow/67248795.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4260","","Private schools will be part of the state's international school board, which is set to be operational from the next academic year, state education minister Vinod Tawde said at the launch of the board on Tuesday.

According to the earlier norms, only government schools were allowed to become part of the board. Through the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB), the state education department aims to bring in a curriculum similar to that of international schools in state-run institutions. A total of 455 schools, including government, aided and self-financed schools from across the state, have applied to become a part of the board. In the first phase, the schools will follow the curriculum of the new board from pre-primary to Class 3, with Marathi as the medium of instruction for the first year. Currently, the governing body of the board is in the process of scanning the applications from schools to select the final 100.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards.

"4261","","New Delhi: The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the Aadhaar issuing body, has recently informed the school administrations that they cannot make the 12-digital Aadhaar number mandatory for admission of students and warned that doing so will be against the recent directive of the Supreme Court of India. The announcement from the Aadhaar issuing body came in the backdrop of the start of admission process in Nursery and entry-level classes in over 1,500 private schools in the national capital. As per media reports, several schools are insisting parents to submit their Aadhaar as one of the documents required for admissions.

Speaking about the same with news agency PTI, UIDAI chief Ajay Bhushan Pandey has said that the department is aware about the fact that some private schools are demanding Aadhaar cards for admission of students. ""This is not right. This is not as per the provisions of law...school admission and other facility to children cannot be made conditional to production of Aadhaar,"" Pandey told the news agency.

The UIDAI has also warned the school administration to make sure that none of the students are denied admission for not providing Aadhaar as admission document. ""In fact, schools should admit children without Aadhaar and ensure that children are given Aadhaar once they are in schools by arranging special camps for them,"" Pandey said.

The Supreme Court, in September this year, upheld the constitutional validity of Aadhaar and stated that it would remain mandatory for filing income tax returns and allotment of Permanent Account Number (PAN). However, the top court also mentioned that the 12-digital unique identification number will not be mandatory for opening bank accounts, mobile connections and school admissions.

The apex court's directive also stated that Aadhaar would not be mandatory for school admissions, as also for the examinations conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Examination (CBSE), National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) for medical entrance and the University Grants Commission (UGC).

"4267","","Report reveals that few private schools have fulfilled this mandatory condition under the RTE Act, and state govts haven't cracked the whip.

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

Also read: Private schools will lose affiliation if they charge extra fees or sell uniforms: CBSE

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said.","20 lakh seats reserved in private schools for poor children but only 20% get filled","1023565053","2018-12-21","https://theprint.in/governance/20-lakh-seats-reserved-in-private-schools-for-poor-children-but-only-20-get-filled/166749/","ThePrint",FALSE

Talking to TOI on the sidelines of a meeting, attended by education department officials and representatives of private schools on Wednesday, the DM said parents could get in touch with the block education officer for seeking help in the admission process.

""A grievance cell will be made functional where parents can lodge complaints against schools denying admissions or violating the RTE Act. The district administration has set a target of getting approximately 5,000 students, belonging to the economically weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, enrolled in private schools in their neighbourhoods,"" the DM said and added the administration had helped almost 3500 'poor' students get admission to private schools under the RTE Act last year.

These include guards in buses, speed governors, CCTV cameras, global positioning system, contact details of drivers and conductors, name of schools, grills on windows, entry and exit gates.

Some prominent schools are also giving points to those opting for pick and drop service.

Apart from the mandatory 25 per cent of the total seats reserved for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS)/disadvantaged groups, private schools can select a set of criteria against which they allot specific points to each applicant for admission into nursery or entry level classes.

To ensure that schools don't adopt any arbitrary criteria, the Directorate of Education had last month issued a list of 50 disallowed criteria, including vegetarianism, social/noble cause, parents' education, declaration regarding picking or drop, first-come-first-get, non-alcoholic, non-smoker parent criteria. The DoE said these criteria were ""unfair, unreasonable and non-transparent"".

But several schools are openly allotting points on such criteria, flouting the guidelines. Mahavir Senior Model School for instance, is giving five points each to children of parents who are non-smokers, vegetarian and teetotalers. Darshan Academy in north Delhi has reserved 15 points to ""freelancers or original research/recognition received in the area or contribution, physical or professional work, (both pro-bono) through a registered NGO or freelancers.""

Some popular schools such as Tagore International School, East of Kailash and Vasant Vihar, Apeejay School in Saket and Pitampura, and Bloom Public School have separate points for areas covered by school transport. In its guidelines, the DoE had pointed out that declaration regarding picking or drop is ""illogical"" and it is the choice of the parents to opt for school transport or not. A senior DoE official said the criteria would be reviewed soon and action would be taken against schools flouting the norms.

"4273","","For a long time in policy circles it was argued that education should be made compulsory for the children of the poor. Apparently, the poor didn't know the value of education and used their children as labour.

This debate should have died after the 1991 liberalisation when poor parents woke up and became eager to send their children to English medium schools. Was this treated as good news? Not really, for the elites found something else to complain about.

The poor wanted schools, but couldn't find any. Many primary schools that had supposedly been ""built"" by government in remote villages simply didn't exist: that money had long evaporated through corruption. Where the poor did have a local primary school, it was dilapidated and its appointed teachers didn't even come to the school. And in the few cases where the teachers did come, the parents found the teachers to be hopelessly incompetent. Not a surprise since most of them have bribed their way into the job.

And so, as Gurcharan Das has said, India grows at night. Where the government fails, private enterprise steps in to retrieve the situation and bring in a modicum of development. That's what happened in the school sector. To meet this huge demand, private for-profit low-cost schools sprung up like mushrooms. These were not perfect by any stretch of imagination but they were vastly superior to the non-existent or even the average government ""school"", as Tooley's diligent research has shown.

When this happened, the elites moved their goalpost and started complaining against these private schools. Anurag Behar's recent article in Live Mint is a case in point. No matter the poor do, India's elites will always find something wrong with them.

The elites are now demanding a huge increase in government management and funding in the school sector. Apparently, it was not enough for the government to have failed totally and comprehensively for 70 years. Our only saviour is our government once again, headed by criminals who appoint teachers through bribes and who pocket the taxes allocated for school infrastructure. According to our elites, the private sector is nothing but a pain in the neck and must be sidelined.

In my view there are two explanations for this inexplicable view by people like Mr Behar. Either these elites are grossly ill-informed or they have a hidden agenda. Is it possible that not being capable of delivering better low-cost schools that poor parents will pay for, in the face of cut-throat competition, elite NGOs are bagging their competition in order to grab government subsidies?

But let me take a more charitable perspective, which turns out to be possibly worse in some ways. I suspect the real explanation is that these elites have a strong ideological belief in socialism which has made them blind to the blatant crimes and corruption of government, even where the evidence is right in front of their nose.

In India we pay twice for everything: first we pay the government, and then, after it has failed, we pay a second time, to the private sector, to finally get the job done, with whatever money we still have left in our pocket.

The elites must surely realise that nothing concentrates the mind more than poverty. Even the slightest expenditure the poor make must pass the most stringent tests. That poor parents are choosing to pay twice for their children's education tells that something is seriously wrong with the government system. To suggest that such poor people are stupid and gullible is to discount what they are trying to tell us: Stop looting us and let us free.

We know from Tooley's research (and I have some personal direct evidence that I'll mention some other day in another context) that these parents are actively monitoring the performance of their children. And to ensure that these parents' don't move their child to another school, the school owners are constantly monitoring the performance of the teachers. The incentives align perfectly.

Of course, these schools have poor infrastructure - but that's all the poor can pay for. This, however, is not the pivotal issue. Gandhi rightly told us that it is not school infrastructure but the teacher that matters most. We need teachers who actually come to teach. And second, that these teachers are at least moderately competent.

It is unfortunate that an institution named after one of India's greatest entrepreneurs, Aziz Premji, has such a dim view about perhaps the greatest example of entrepreneurship in the world - the low cost for-profit private schools of India.

Good policy can't be made by assuming a role for government. It must begin by understanding any market failure and doing the best to support the market to overcome any such failure. Today there is a real market in school education in India with very little market failure. All we need is to support these schools through school vouchers for the poorest of the poor. Indeed, that's our party's policy.

One last point. Mr Behar points out that teachers in such schools are paid below the minimum wage. Our party rejects the very concept of minimum wage which is both theoretically and practically proven to harm the poorest of the poor. Our party will abolish minimum wage laws. Instead of seeing this as a problem, I suggest that Mr Behar celebrate the vast employment that these schools have generated and how well they are serving a genuine need to the best of their ability - despite total government antipathy.

It is not that these teachers are underpaid. Instead, teachers in government schools are grossly overpaid. In a private competitive system, teachers would all receive their marginal product. Better teachers would be paid vastly more than any teacher is paid today.","Ill-informed opposition to private schools for the poor","1013739549","2018-12-08","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/seeing-the-invisible/ill-informed-opposition-to-private-schools-for-the-poor/","The Times of India",FALSE
"4274","","CHENNAI: Private educational institutions in Tamil Nadu will continue to be exempted from paying property tax, as the Madras high court on Friday stayed the operation of an amendment brought to the Tamil Nadu Municipal Laws removing exemption to such institutions.

A division bench comprising Justice S Manikumar and Justice Subramonium Prasad gave the interim reprieve to private educational institutions, on a plea moved by All India Private Educational Institutions Association assailing the amendment dated January 25.

According to the petitioner, the Chennai City Municipal Corporation Act, Madurai City Municipal Corporation Act, Coimbatore City Municipal Corporation Act and the Tamil Nadu District Municipalities Act provided exemption from payment of property tax to educational institutions in the state.

The state government brought in certain amendments to these Acts to remove the exemption provided to the institutions and empowering the authorities to levy property tax for the properties owned by the institutions. After the amendment, only government run educational institutions would get the exemption, the petitioner said.

The move was immediately challenged by the association in the high court. The high court dismissed the plea holding that the government has power to cancel exemption granted to educational institutions. Subsequently, the association approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court order. While the appeal is pending before the apex court, the state levied property taxes on the institutions based on the amendments and demand notices were issued to the institutions for payment of tax.","Property tax exemption to continue for private schools - Times of India","1013384945","2018-12-08","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/property-tax-exemption-to-continue-for-private-schools/articleshow/66994726.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4275","","NEW DELHI: A committee formed to examine the fee hike by private schools in New Delhi on Wednesday recommended refund in the cases of 602 institutes. Out of these, 254 schools were found to have charged fee in excess of their requirement. The committee was set up by the Delhi High Court to look into the matter.

The aggregate amount of refund recommended by the committee is J17,788.92 lakh.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) in its February 11, 2009, order permitted private schools to hike their fees and for this five slabs were prescribed, depending upon the existing tuition fees charged by the schools. The hike permitted in tuition fees was primarily to offset the additional burden o the schools consequent to implementation of 6th pay commission report.

"4276","","BENGALURU: Barely a month after schools were reopened post the annual Dasara vacation, several private schools in the city, irrespective of which board they are following, have already started their admission process for the next academic year (2019-20) for Class 1. This is in violation with the policy on Karnataka Educational Institutions (Regulation of Certain Fees and Donations) (Amendment) Rules 2018, which has been in force mandating the schools to stick to the calendar of events released by the Department of Public Instruction for admission.

The issue has gone viral on social media platforms, where parents have formed groups alleging that schools are charging up to '1,000 as fee per application form without confirming a seat.

This reporter from The New Indian Express visited some schools on Friday posing as a parent seeking admission and was shocked to learn that some schools have even closed the admission process for the next academic year.

Authorities of one such school located in South Bengaluru, offering both CBSE and ICSE syllabus, said, ""You are too late. We have already finished issuing applications for the next academic year and seats will also be announced soon.""

Another prime school, also located in Bengaluru South, issued the application form, but said they cannot assure a seat as they have already received application forms in excess of the seats available. ""We cannot assure you the seat. We are already flooded with applications. You will have to try your luck. If someone surrenders their seat, you may get a chance,"" said a front office staff member.

So blatant is this malpractice in the background of the sheer lack of regulation or enforcement of rules that some schools have even dared to publish their commencement of admission process for academic year 2019-20 on their official websites without fear of reprisals.

Shilpa Prashanth, a South Bengaluru parent said, ""I was looking for admission of my son at one of the prime schools in our locality, but I was surprised to hear that I was too late. Although I approached them in mid-October, the school had already closed the admission process.""

Another parent said, ""I took applications for my son from three main schools in West Bengaluru, but of the three, one school said they cannot promise a seat, while another demanded full payment of fees up front, now itself. So, I have decided to wait for communication from the third school.""

Moreover, some of the schools which are confirming the seats while collecting advance fees to block the seats, are refraining from giving a receipt to the parents in return for the payment. ""We have to agree at the risk of losing the amount as the schools are not giving receipts. But, as it is hard to get seats in these schools, we are being forced to agree and accept whatever the conditions laid down by the schools,"" said one desperate parent.

Scared to file plaint

"4281","","Srinagar, Nov 13: Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK) while coming heavily on the administration today alleged that the local private schools are being maligned, humiliated and bullied.

While addressing a press conference here today, they alleged that over the last few weeks there has been a sustained effort to undermine the private education sector in Kashmir, which has created a dangerous situation for the entire society.

The Association while condemning the move said that the certain lobby in administration and few other quarters who in one way or other are trying to destroy the fledgling private education sector in Kashmir.

G N Var, chairman PSAJK said that Legal Metrology Department, Directorate of School Education, Fee Fixation Committee, district administration and everybody who wields some sort of power are swooping down on small private schools to harass them. In the name of selling books, schools are being targeted unnecessarily.

""Today running a private school has become a herculean task. With mudslinging, barrage of allegations and character assassinations, private schools are being labelled as some kind of criminals,"" he said.

War said incidentally, there is no rule which specifically says that schools cannot keep books in their schools for sale. In fact in February this year, High Court in New Delhi had allowed the sale of books, uniforms in schools at the tuck shops set up at affiliated schools across the country, holding that the sale of such items does not amount to ""commercialization"" of education.

""If the Government was sincere about selling of books in private schools, why didn't they take up the issue when the big schools like Missionary Schools sold every book, notebook and stationery items from their schools? Where were they when these schools forced parents to buy everything from their schools? This has been their practice for more than 20 years, yet they were never raided. It was only when the admission time in local private schools came, the Government suddenly wakes up. Two respected private schools like Green Valley and R P School were given harsh punishment even as no hand was laid on Missionary Schools despite later being way too costly,"" he said.

""In an ideal situation, the Government should have emulated the private school model and revolutionized the education sector. They could have provided the best education to the lowest of strata using our model but what they are doing is to destroy the only successful model of education in Kashmir.

"4283","","Nagpur: CBSE is miffed with majority of its affiliated schools for not uploading transfer certificates (TC) issued to students, even though the central board made the process mandatory in 2014 itself.

CBSE had asked all affiliated schools to upload transfer certificates (TC) issued to students after completion of Std IX or XI, but almost all private schools have continued to ignore the diktat. The 2014 decision was taken so that students seeking admission to Std X or XII do not face delays just because their TC from previous school could not be verified. It was in the same year that CBSE's rule of counter-signature of TCs from school to the other was scrapped.

CBSE wrote to schools a few weeks ago saying that many schools are not following the rule even though it is mandatory. It added that students are facing unnecessary delays in admissions because of this. In the post-2014 scenario, CBSE simplified the Std X and XII admission process by asking the new schools to simply verify the student's TC from his previous school's web site and complete the admission formalities. But with private schools ignoring the rule, the paperwork for student increases and it delays admission in the new school.

Even though this practice is mandatory, none of the Nagpur-based private schools, whose websites were checked by TOI, had uploaded details of the TC. They didn't even give any tab on website mentioning that no TCs were taken. Government controlled Kendriya Vidyalayas (KV) have a separate tab on their website which gives details of TCs issued in the current academic year. While KVs have been a step ahead of their private counterparts in implementing the rule, they still have not complied fully with CBSE's diktat, though the details they mention contain all required information.

CBSE's rule is very clear. It says that a scanned copy of the TC has to be uploaded on the school's website. While KV's website have not uploaded a scanned copy, they have mentioned clearly every relevant detail of the TC. This includes the student's name, father's name, TC number, issuing date, class etc.","CBSE miffed as private schools ignore mandatory TC upload rule - Times of India","991409831","2018-11-10","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/cbse-miffed-as-private-schools-ignore-mandatory-tc-upload-rule/articleshow/66569852.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4285","","In recent past, the commercial activities of the private schools have attracted a lot of media attention in the Valley. It is now a well-known fact that many schools force parents to buy books and uniforms only from a particular shop. This way they earn some extra money from the sale of the books and uniforms which in turn are sold to parents at an exorbitant cost. A prominent missionary school in Baramulla was recently fined for selling textbooks through a single bookshop only. But the menace is not confined to a single school only. Many elite schools in the Valley themselves sell these books but no action has so far been taken against them. It is thus necessary that the action against schools shouldn't be initiated on a selective basis.

Also, forays into commercial activities isn't only thing that is wrong with the private schools: their arbitrary fee structure and for that matter the quality of their teaching itself is a great cause of concern. What is needed, therefore, is not only the regulation of their commercial activities and the fee structure but a comprehensive look at the whole system of private schooling in the state. The objective should not be more regulation of these schools but to ensure that they deliver quality education for which they charge heavily. Kashmir has witnessed an unprecedented growth of private schools and most of these lack infrastructure and adequately qualified staff. And even with schools which have the infrastructure, the quality of education is pits.

Private schools have tried to act as more disciplined and rigorous academic counterparts of the Government schools: regular class work, less holidays and more extra-curricular activities have been their hallmark. But so far as quality of education is concerned, there is little that sets them apart. They charge heavy fees from the parents and compensate it not by imparting good quality education but by showing off some style: bright uniforms and more extra-curricular activities. Education in these schools is about stage-management: loaded satchels, excessive homework and an endless supply of stationary which in turn is cleverly bound up with the business part of running a school.

The aspect of the school which gets least attention is the education, which in turn boils down to the recruitment of good teachers. The schools hire the disaffected educated youth who are willing to work for a pittance as a prelude to a much sought-after permanent government job. And most of them miserably lack the depth of knowledge to be good teachers. This malaise afflicts our educational system right through - from primary schools to the universities. Surprisingly, some of the franchise schools which have forayed into Valley in recent years are similarly afflicted: a large, imposing infrastructure but little depth in the all-important tuition part of their functioning. Even though, it is equally the job of parents to see that these schools provide the quality education they seek for their wards, government can help by forcing these institutions to pay well to the teachers which in turn will attract better talent.","Private Schools Need Public Accountability","988571224","2018-11-07","https://kashmirobserver.net/2018/editorial/private-schools-need-public-accountability-37665","Kashmir Observer",FALSE

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Nov. 3 : A legislator has noted reports that are implied to be practices of subtle discrimination in private institutions. Some of these include priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to 'weak' students; or schools asking parents to deposit money, which are not returned unless their wards improve in performance.

The advisor was addressing the 25th anniversary of the All Nagaland Private Schools Association, Dimapur unit (ANSPA) at the Dimapur District Sports Council which was packed with students, teachers, and guests on November 3 to celebrate the silver jubilee.

The advisor for School Education, K Tokugha Sukhalu, attended the occasion as its main guest. He said that the private schools were performing better than the government institutions in terms of discipline, culture and accountability. While Dimapur is comparatively better than the rest of the districts, he said, there is very less space for outdoor activities though. He said learning methods are changing and the ANSPA should be able to manage trained personnel so that children are equipped with proper skills. He appealed to the teachers to ensure that courses are completed in time and ensure children are taught properly.

However, the advisor pointed out some of negative reports that reportedly were doing the rounds with regard to private educational institutions. These reports included alleged priority being given to 'good' students while transfer certificates are being given to weak students; reputed schools asking parents to deposit money and unless the children improve, funds are reportedly not returned.

At these, he asked the teachers to be proud of their students no matter what 'background difference' there may be. One cannot compare students based on their educational backgrounds and ""you never know the brightest students may lose tomorrow,"" he said. Institutions should not be only for profit-making but to ensure that students are nurtured to be the leaders of future, he reminded.

Enrolment in private institutions is increasing whereas enrolment in government institutions is decreasing. So, the responsibility is huge for the ANSPA, Sukhalu remarked. He added that students are the future and urged the children to pledge to be the ""leaders of tomorrow.""

The director of the Central Board of School Education at Guwahati, KK choudhury, also addressed the event. He said that ""Nagaland is a big contributor to the literacy rate of the country with 80.11%.""

In this changing scenario, non-conventional subjects are getting importance and employment opportunities are being widened. Almost 90% of job opportunities are available in the unorganised sector, he said. The official encouraged the gathering to embrace technology and incorporate the knowledge in their field.

"4290","","BENGALURU: Over 50 private schools in Bengaluru are allegedly not following the Compulsory Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015 which was implemented strictly from the current academic year.

The list available with the state department of public instructions, provided by the Deputy Directors of Public Instructions (DDPI), indicates that over 50 private schools affiliated to various boards have violated the act and are not introducing Kannada as their first or second language.

Following the recommendations by the Kannada Development Authority (KDA), the state government had decided to make Kannada a compulsory subject (first or second language) at all the schools functioning in the state, irrespective of the board they follow, and the same had been implemented from the academic year 2018-19. But, even six months after the commencement of the academic year, some schools have been found violating the rule.

When the state government took this decision, several private schools affiliated to CBSE and ICSE boards had raised an objection. But, later as it became a state policy, the schools were forced to implement it.

Recently, the Kannada Development Authority received complaints against some of the schools alleging that they were not following the said rule. Based on the complaints, KDA chairperson Prof SG Siddaramaiah wrote a letter to the state department of primary and secondary education to submit a report.

""Following the letter received from the KDA chairperson, we have instructed our DDPIs to visit the schools across the state and submit a report about the alleged violation. For some of the districts, we have yet to get the report,"" said Basavaraja, director of primary education department.

He said the department would initiate an action against such schools soon by first issuing notices as per the process. ""Once we get the report from all the districts we will issue notices to school managements which are violating the Compulsory Kannada rule,"" Basavaraja said.

The KDA authorities, on their part, have directed the primary and secondary education department to initiate action to disaffiliate such schools. Prof Siddaramaiah said, ""I have written a letter to the education department about the violation of the act by some of the private schools and have asked them to submit action taken report. But till date we have not received a reply from them. The department must take measures immediately to disaffiliate such schools.""

However, the rule framed by the department has no provisions to disaffiliate violating schools. As per the rules, the department can only levy a penalty of '500 on such schools in the first year.","Private schools violating compulsory Kannada Act in Bengaluru","981520919","2018-10-29","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2018/oct/29/private-schools-violating-compulsory-kannada-act-in-bengaluru-1891406.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The admission for entry level classes for the academic session 2019-2020 will begin in the next two months.

According to a recent report by the Delhi Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR)s, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

"4293","","With the increasing number of complaints related to fee hikes in private schools across the state, a Pune-based lawyer has created an online database to make parents more aware about the law with respect to fees hike.

The database comprises laws, policy decisions and specific provisions with respect to school fees to help parents with their complaints. The website - www.jaihindbks.com - enlists all the state and Central regulations on fees with specific references to provisions under the acts that can be invoked against private schools charging indiscriminately against various heads.

""Over the last few years, with the increase in the number of English medium private schools in the state, fee hike-related complaints have become very common. In most cases, schools try to take advantage of the fact that parents are not aware of the laws that are in place and mint money,"" said Siddharth Shankar Sharma, the creator of the database. The 33-year-old said that while many parents understand that the school is flouting norms, they do not have the necessary legal knowledge to file a complaint or move court.

Prasad Tulaskar, a parent who has been fighting a case with a Dadar school said that mere protests and demonstrations do not yield into any concrete change in the school's stand. ""Instead, a simple right to information (RTI) query or a letter to the state education department or the child rights commission would lead to schools thinking twice before charging parents under abrupt heads,"" said Tulaskar.

The website also has past court orders on fee hike cases of various schools across the states for parents to refer to. ""We have tried to simplify the laws for parents who cannot afford lawyers to fight their cases,"" said Sharma.

"4294","","NEW DELHI:The HRD Ministry has asked the states to provide data about vacant seats under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) category in entry-level classes in private schools.

The move comes in the wake of a report by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) according to which around 13,000 nursery seats reserved for children from economically disadvantaged households in private schools in the 2018-19 academic session remain unfilled in the national capital.

""I have asked the states to provide data about vacant EWS seats and then we will analyse what can be done to ensure the candidates under the category can make best use of the available provisions,"" Union HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of the seats are to be reserved for the EWS and Disadvantaged Group (DG) categories in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools.

"4295","","Seven months into the academic session, hundreds of economically disadvantaged parents in the national capital have complained that their wards had not been provided with free books, stationery and uniforms by many private schools, in violation of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

Take the case of a 40-year-old single mother, who earns no more than Rs 4,000 a month. She said her excitement at her daughter getting enrolled in a private school in east Delhi's Mayur Vihar was short-lived as she was forced to then spend money on her books, uniform and stationery. ""My daughter was admitted to Anglo Indian Public School in Class 1, under the economically weaker section (EWS) category, this year. We were told we would get everything for free, as per the RTE (Act). But so far, nothing has been provided. I have spent nearly Rs 8,000 on her books, stationery, and uniform,"" the woman said, requesting anonymity. She said she had the bills for items worth Rs 7,900.

The woman said she was concerned about paying for her daughter's winter uniform, which would cost at least Rs 3,000.

Officials at Anglo Indian Public School said they had been unable to provide free uniforms and stationery items because they had not yet received any funds from the government. Chander Singh, a spokesperson for the school, said: ""Last year too, we received only Rs 1,125 per student. How can this amount cover books, uniform and stationery items and examination fees?""

Under the RTE Act, 2009, 25 % of seats in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and first standard -- are to be reserved for children whose parents earn less than Rs 1 lakh per annum. The Delhi RTE rules specify that students enrolled under the EWS/DG (disadvantaged group) categories in private schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms, for which the government reimburses a fixed amount.

At present, the Delhi government is supposed to reimburse Rs 1,100 per student for uniforms and another Rs 2,200 for books, stationery, tuition and exam fees.

HT is in possession of at least 100 complaints, written by families who claim they have been deprived of the free study material and uniforms by private schools.

""We have received hundreds of complaints from parents whose children are not provided anything by private schools. We had forwarded all the complaints to the education minister's office but to no avail,"" Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organisation working for EWS children in Delhi, said.

Debate over funds

In 2013, a group of private schools had moved the Delhi high court claiming that the amount paid by the state government per child was too low to meet all expenses. The court, in 2014, directed private schools to provide books, stationery items and uniforms to students under the EWS/DG categories, and said it was the responsibility of both the government and the schools to ensure free education to these students. The matter is still subjudice. Even as the Delhi high court issued as many as 46 reminders to private schools between April 2014 and September 2018 to provide the required materials, parents claim they have still not received anything.

Most of the private schools this correspondent contacted declined to comment, saying the matter was subjudice.

Kamal Gupta, counsellor, Committee of Unaided Recognised Private Schools in Delhi, a body representing 450 private schools said half the schools have not received any funds from the government.

Sanjay Goel, director of the Delhi government's education department -- Directorate of Education (DoE) -- said it already provided funds to the private schools and was requesting the government for ""additional funds"" to meet the revised estimates. The government, this year, increased the reimbursement amount by Rs 600.

""Whatever demand is pending for this year will be fully met by end-November. However, the delayed release of funds cannot be the reason for private schools not giving books and uniforms to the students,"" he said. Goel said the DoE had also issued multiple notices to many schools and warned they would de-recognise them if they did not provide books and uniforms.

Parents bear costs

Another parent, requesting anonymity, said two of his children were not given uniforms by a private school in north Delhi. ""My children got admission in nursery and Class 1 under the EWS category this year. The school had given them used books but not uniforms and stationery. I had to buy those myself,"" said the man, who works in a grocery shop and earns Rs 5,000 a month.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate representing families in Delhi high court, said, ""There is no provision under which the parents can claim reimbursements once they spend the money on these things. They can only be issued a fresh set of uniforms or books once the schools get the money.""

"4296","","Parents opting admission for their wards under the Right To Education (RTE) Act prefer private schools to government institutes. They feel the private ones are more conducive and safer, found a recent study 'Adversarial Parental Perceptions About Government Schools in Ahmedabad'. The study was conducted by Right To Education Resource Centre (RTERC) of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIMA).

Many parents have a poor impression about the government schools because they've had bad experiences, RTERC researchers said. However, their opinion slightly changed after they visited several government schools.

The study, supported by UNICEF was conducted by professor Ankur Sarin of IIMA and a research associate Nisha Warnekar found flaws with issues such as lack of teachers, non-teaching staff loaded with too much work, principals and administrators lacking authority over teachers, among others. The findings come at a crucial time when around 40,000 seats under the RTE Act remain vacant this year.

""We interviewed several parents belonging to a particular geographical area comprising 34 schools. We wanted to compare their responses. We investigated the extent of information asymmetry amongst the households on the lines of parental perceptions. Our researchers also visited ten schools,"" professor Sarin's team said.

The parents feel that schools should have CCTV cameras, students should have uniforms, identity cards, and regular parent-teacher meets.

The parents suggested that government schools usually were large open spaces where anyone could walk in because the gates are always open. On the contrary, the private schools are ""bandh killas"" or fortresses.

For this reason, parents said, their wards often leave the premises during school hours.

In contrast, the parents whose wards made it to the private ones feel the gates are locked and the students can't leave the premises during school hours.

Many government schools are cleaner and more spacious than the private ones. Some say many have walls that are nicely done or boards displaying letters and numbers in different languages, maps and prayers. The infrastructure in these schools are also better and focus on extracurricular activities.

However, many parents cited the new focus of government schools on extracurricular activity and participation in competitions as being a waste of time.

""Private schools, in contrast, were incredibly cramped with almost 60- 65 students sitting on benches, which is double its capacity. Another private school was located in the middle of a marketplace and reels under tremendous noise. To solve this, the authorities have put up boards on the windows. This has made the classrooms dark and dingy,"" professor Sarin said.

""We found mixed results inside the classrooms. For example, in one government school, a teacher was very strict. But, even many private schools had the same rules. Also, in one of the private schools, we found a teacher spending a lot of time during the class on the phone. The students silently sneaked out without taking any permission,"" Sarin added.

The report found that all five government schools had at least one teacher short. As one school explained, a recent mandate on the qualification of teachers had led to a shortage of subject teachers in secondary classes.

This led to an excess of primary grade teachers and a shortage of secondary-level teachers. The two Urdu medium schools said it was a major problem as very few with higher degrees required to teach in the secondary classes. The report concluded laying a map for the state government which can help parents change their perception. They included highlighting achievements of government schools, ensuring more accountability, etc.","Ahmedabad: RTE parents prefer private schools, says study","973935924","2018-10-20","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-ahmedabad-rte-parents-prefer-private-schools-says-study-2677128","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"4297","","CBSE's revised bylaws say any hidden costs in school's fee structure will now lead to stringent punishment. Teams will visit and assess schools' quality too.

New Delhi: Amid numerous complaints that private schools charge exorbitant fees and additional expenses, the government is trying to make their functioning more transparent.

The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has been tasked with making sure that private schools charge what they declare -- that there are no hidden costs in their fee structure, and they do not ask parents to buy uniforms, books and other things from the school.

All this is now part of CBSE's revised bylaws, and if schools don't adhere to these rules, they can be disaffiliated.

""Regarding fee, the bylaws clearly state that full fee should be disclosed and there should be no hidden costs,"" a senior CBSE official said.

""The bylaws clearly state that fee is to be charged as per the regulation of the appropriate government and fee revision shall be subject to laws.""

There are 20,783 schools affiliated to CBSE in India and other countries, teaching over 1.9 crore students.

The board will also focus on mapping learning outcomes in schools, which means assessing the quality of learning among students.

Teams from CBSE will visit schools for surveys, and also rank them on other parameters. If any school is found lagging on any of the parameters set by the board, it can be disaffiliated for a minimum of six months.

""Inspection of schools will now be outcome-based and more academic and quality-oriented, rather than focussing only on school infrastructure,"" the CBSE official said.

""The inspection will focus on academic excellence and progress of students over time, innovations and quality of pedagogy, capacity of teachers and teacher training, inclusive practices in school, quality of co-scholastic activities, whether curricular load is as per norms, whether there is adequate focus on sports and games etc.

"4298","","Almost 13,000 nursery seats reserved for children from economically disadvantaged households in private schools in the 2018-19 academic session remain unfilled in the city with less than two months remaining for the start of the admission process for the next session (2019-20).

According to records of the Directorate of Education (DoE) , of the 48,122 seats reserved under the so-called economically weaker section or EWS category in private schools at the entry level, only 35,500 seats have been filled. And according to a recent report submitted by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to the DoE, as many as 74 private schools did not admit even a single student under the EWS category in the last two academic sessions.

The schools have given a variety of reasons for refusing admission: no vacancies; the school being too far from the home of the child seeking admission; or that even general category seats are yet to be filled. The sixth round of admissions is still underway.

In some cases, parents this correspondent interviewed alleged that private schools denied admission to their wards even after their names appeared in the selected lists. DoE's response to this is that many such families do not report for admission even after the names have come up in the draw of lots and the selected names are displayed on the DoE website. DoE, which comes under the state government's education department, releases the list of selected candidates.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said, ""All these seats are vacant in less popular schools. Parents are not interested in getting their kids enrolled there. We have issued multiple notices to the schools after receiving complaints from parents. We have also sent our officials in many schools for inspection and found that parents did not report there.""

One parent says he and his ward reported and were turned away. ""I have been making rounds to Panchsheel Public School in Badarpur since March for the admission of my six-year-old son. His name appeared for admission in Class I in the first list. However, we were told that there was no vacancy and we would be called by the school when all the general seats are filled. How can he be allotted a school where there are no vacancies?"" said Tasneem Ahmed, who works in a grocery shop. He has been applying to enrol his son in a private school under the EWS category for the last three years.

""He will exceed the age limit if he does not get admission this year,"" said Ahmed. Children over the age of six are not eligible for entry-level admission in the EWS category.

Officials at Panchsheel Public School said there are no seats on offer. ""We had only one vacancy for class I this year and we had informed the DoE about it. We do not have any vacant seat,"" said Bharti Mehta, principal of the school.

Similarly, Shiv Kumar, a vegetable vendor in Mehrauli, said his four-year-old son was denied admission in Deep Public School in Vasant Kunj. ""I was not even given a proper reason for the denial. An official said that there was no vacancy,"" he claimed Officials at the school, however, denied the charges saying that all students whose names appeared in the list were given admission.

Still, there are some instances where the children have not reported for admission. This reporter met some families which did not report for admission to the schools. Many said the school was far from home. ""I stay in north Delhi's Samaipur Badli and my four-year-old was assigned three schools in Dwarka, which is at the distance of 20 km from our house. How can we enrol our little one there?"" asked Jyoti Kumari, a homemaker.

As per norms, children must be assigned schools within 3km range of their residence for entry level classes.

Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25% of seats are to be reserved for the EWS category in entry-level classes -- nursery, KG and I -- in all private schools. Despite receiving over 100,000 applications every year, thousands of seats go vacant. As per the affidavits submitted by DoE in the Delhi high court, copies of which are with Hindustan Times, of 48,122 available EWS seats in private schools in Delhi, only 20,000 and 19,000 were filled in the last two academic sessions, 2017-18 and 2016-17, respectively.

DoE said it has set the target of filling at least 40,000 seats this year. ""We are yet to complete the final round of admission and hoping to fill over 40,000 seats this year,"" Goel said.

Khagesh Jha, an advocate in the Delhi high court said he has filed as many as 50 individual cases on behalf of the parents denied admission this academic session. ""This is a failure of DoE. Every year seats are going vacant and thousands of children are deprived of education in decent private schools. Strict actions need to taken against these schools rather than issuing circulars and notices.""

Experts working for the cause said that they have also approached to the Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia seeking his intervention. ""We have received innumerable complaints from parents who were denied admission by private schools to the education minister but to no avail. Hundreds of parents are still struggling to get their kids enrolled,"" said Ekramul Haque of NGO Mission Taleem.

Ahead of the new academic session, parents have expressed resentment against excessive tuition and admission fee charged by various private schools.

The parents have also accused Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) of not taking action against some schools despite repeated complaints. The allegations come in the wake of de-recognition of two private schools by Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) for charging exorbitant fee.

Parents who have admitted their wards in Iqbal Memorial Institute (IMI) Bemina claimed that they had complained about the extra money charged by the school several times, but the Fee Fixation Committee didn't show any interest to address the issue.

""I admitted my son in the year 2015 and that time they charged me Rs 35,000 as admission fee. Presently the school is charging extra Rs 3900 as annual charges,"" said one of the parents wishing not to be identified.

""Earlier the school was charging Rs 2000 as monthly fee but after the FFC recommended them to charge just Rs 1890, the school adhered to the direction. Now again they are charging Rs 250 extra as computer fee and I am paying Rs 2150 a month including computer charges,"" he added.

Similarly, parents of those students who have admitted their kids in Kashmir Harvard Habak, complained that the school charged Rs 80,000 as admission fee besides charging Rs 3400 as monthly fee including transport charges.

One of the parents said that he admitted his daughter a few weeks late in the school and the authorities charged him extra money, saying that the school has increased the tuition fee.

""I am paying Rs 1500 for the 2nd standard student and more than Rs 1300 for 4th standard,"" he said.

Pertinently, the FFC has recommended Rs 1320 for 2nd standard.

Parents of those students, who have admitted their wards in Presentation Convent School, said they have paid Rs 70,000 as admission fee.

The parents also said that the tuition fee for a year is included in the admission fee.

According to one of the parents, who has admitted her ward in Presentation Convent Srinagar, in summers the school charges Rs 5090 as tuition fee for three months excluding transportation fee which is Rs 1500 per month.

""For winters the school is charging Rs 9120 tuition fee for three months which means we have are paying Rs 3040 per month excluding transportation charges,"" she said.

Similarly, as per sources Burn Hall School Srinagar also charges Rs 80,000 as admission fee.

""The admission fee is merely meant for the admissions; no tuition fee is included in admission fee.""

According to parents, the school charges Rs 2800 as monthly tuition fee in winters and over Rs 2600 in summers.

""In winters we are paying Rs 8,600 as tuition fee for three months excluding transport fee which is Rs 4800 and for the summers we are paying above Rs 8,000 excluding transport fee.""

According to the FFC, the school is supposed to charge Rs 1890 for first standard to 10th standard and Rs 2390 for 11th and 12th standard.

The FFC order (No 262-FFC of 2018 dated 21-02-2018) has clearly mentioned that the school shall not charge any other kind of fee unless a prior permission for the same is obtained.

Parents said Delhi Public School (DPS) Srinagar is charging Rs 1.10 lakh as admission fee.

One of the parents, Tahir Ahmad Dar (name changed) said his ward is studying in UKG and the school authorities are charging Rs 2750 as monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 monthly bus fee.

His two other kids are studying in 8th standard and 5th standard and he is paying Rs 4250 monthly tuition fee and Rs 2100 bus fee for both classes.

According to FFC, the Linton Hall School in Rajbagh is supposed to charge Rs 1200 per month for the students of UKG to 10th standard as tuition fee.

However, top officials of FFC said they are they are charging Rs 1350 more as monthly tuition fee.

The FFC official said they have recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee for RP School, ""but they started charging Rs 1900 which also resulted in the suspension of its recognition"".

Green Valley Educational Institute Buchpora is charging Rs 83,000 as admission fee for the new entrants of nursery class and KG-I.

Sources told Rising Kashmir that the school has different charges for admission as the school is charging Rs 48,000 as admission fee for students getting admitted in 11th standard in which school is taking tuition fee from the admission fee for a year.

For the 11th standard, the FFC allowed the school to charge Rs 3255 for medical students and Rs 3015 for Arts students and for 12th standard the school had been allowed to charge Rs 3580 for the medical students and Rs 3320 for Arts students.

The FFC official said the school was violating norms and will not reclaim recognition unless they adhere to its guidelines.

The parents of those wards who are studying in Foundation World School said they are being charged Rs 50,000 as admission fee.

Parent of one of the wards said, ""My kid is studying in the nursery class and I am paying Rs 8000 monthly fee including Rs 6000 tuition fee and Rs 2000 transport fee.""

The Woodlands School Shivpora charges Rs 28,000 as admission fee for new entrants.

""They are charging Rs 3200 fee. The school charges transport fee according to the distance.""

Officials in FFC said they lack manpower and cannot monitor each and every private school.

""There are more than two thousand private schools in the valley and we don't have that much of manpower available with us. This committee was formed a few years back and it will take time to upgrade it,"" he said.

When contacted, the chairperson and officials of FFC did not respond to repeated calls and messages from this reporter.

Director School Education Kashmir, GN Itoo said the complaints against any school received by FFC are being taken seriously and necessary action will be taken immediately.

""Recently FFC has issued a circular in which they have asked all private schools to reveal their current fee structure, admission fee and transportation fee as well and once they will get the details from schools, it will be decided by DSEK as to what should be done with the violators,"" he said.

Itoo further said the FFC has sought help from DSEK also. ""And we have assured them that nodal officers from CEO office will help them at the district level.""

years of 2016-17 and 2017-18, an analysis has shown.

The analysis, commissioned by the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR), was carried out by Indus Action, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) working towards implementation of Section 12(1)(C) of The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009. The clause mandates that private, unaided schools reserve 25 per cent of their seats in entry-level classes for EWS/DG category students.

The data for the analysis was obtained from the Directorate of Education (DoE).

According to the report filed by the NGO, 48 private schools did not admit any student under the quota in 2016-17 while seven schools registered no admissions under the category in 2017-18. Additionally, about 19 private schools did not admit a single child in both years.

""One of the things asked by the DCPCR to the NGO was to analyse and list the schools who had not given admission to a single child under the quota despite allotment of the seats with them,"" member of DCPCR Anurag Kundu said.

The commission has asked for the phone number of parents allotted seats under the quota, along with reasons recorded by these schools for not admitting them from the DoE.

""All this has been requested to corroborate the claims, by both parents and the school... and to find what the truth is and then initiate an enquiry accordingly,"" Kundu added.

The DoE was not available for comment when approached by the Sunday Standard.

""Private schools are primarily are not interested in giving admissions to children belonging to the EWS and DG category. The improper monitoring by the education department has further given them

leverage to deny admission,"" said Advocate and social activist Ashok Agarwal of NGO Social Jurist which fights for people belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group.

""The purpose of carrying the analysis was to send show cause notice to such private schools. It appeared some of these schools in Delhi outrightly denied.

"4302","","Srinagar: As much affordable the government schools are, parents from Jammu and Kashmir spend hefty amounts to admit their children in private educational institutions to 'ensure that they get the best education'. Apart from the backbreaking process of admissions, the money deposited as 'admission fee' is not even tax-free.

With passing years, the government taxes are only increasing in the valley. From eateries to earnings to the money people spend, everything comes with a tax. ""For what we have, we can pay the taxes. But for what we already spent, how can they ask for tax?"" asks a parent Tawheed Ahmad who recently got his kin admitted in a reputed private school in Srinagar.

After a baby is born, one looks at its face and thinks about the number of classes he/she has to study. People wait for the baby to start talking so that they can send them to a playschool where they can learn alphabets, rhymes, words, numbers, puzzles, games, colours and how to talk in English. This time is 'crucial' for the child as it will decide whether the child can get admitted in a reputed school or not.

""We tried to teach our child at home but in a play school, they learn discipline and exactly the things that will be asked in their interview,"" says Ahmad.

Ahmad had sent his ward to a playschool at the age of 3. ""He would still be sleeping when we would wake him up. He would cry a lot before leaving for the playschool. He would sleep for hours after coming back. This is the necessity of time,"" he explains adding that he had to pay around Rs. 2000 per month as the fees of the playschool for 2 years.

As soon as the news about the availability of school forms came, Ahmad and his wife like thousands of other parents in Kashmir ran to schools in the middle of the night, lining in a queue to grab a form.

""We went to many schools. I sent my brother to some places, me and my wife went to Tyndale Biscoe School. It was around 3 in the morning. There were already 3-4 parents waiting outside the school. We waited and waited. We had taken Namkeen Chai with us. We had breakfast on the road and finally the gate opened,"" he recalls.

After submitting the form, he says, the family would be after the child, asking him all sorts of questions like, ""What is your name, What is your father's name? What is your mother's name? Etc.""

All's well that ends well. The child gets admitted into the school. But that is not the end of the story. For admission in a government school, at the pre-Nursery level, one has to pay nothing.

For admissions in any reputed private school, one has to pay: Rs 25000 at Legends School, Rs 50000 at World Foundation School, Rs 85000 at Green Valley Educational Institute, Rs 80 to 75 thousand at Tyndale Biscoe School and Burhall School; Rs 1 Lakh 5 thousand (Minus Rs 9000/ Rs 6000 Annual Fees) at Doon International School, Rs 50000 at World Foundation School, Rs 93000 at Delhi Public School and around Rs One Lakh at GD Goenka.

""We had started saving even before he was born. But, even that is somehow not enough as we have to pay taxes for the amount of money we pay as admission fees. While paying the taxes on our earnings, we can only show the receipt of the tuition fees,"" says Tawheed.

""It has been going on for years. This is exploitation. First, the schools suck our blood and then the government,"" he adds.

A Chartered Accountant from the valley says, ""We as CA's do not go into the reasoning part of the laws. It is the forte of the lawmakers who draft these laws. I think only the tuition fee is considered as the admission fees is usually hefty. If they, exempt the admission fees, their tax revenue will go down. Also, they frame the policies considering who can and cannot pay taxes.""

"4303","","Nagpur: While welcoming the central government's mass vaccination programme for rubella and measles, many private unaided schools catering middle class and above families feel it should be optional.

School owners and even principals feel this should be a voluntary exercise as almost every student in such schools is already following a proper vaccination schedule through their private paediatrician.

While no one wanted to speak officially, schools felt that this mass vaccination should be optional. ""Parents themselves are vary of having their child take any kind of vaccination without their own doctor's supervision. And this tendency is not just limited to the upper middle or rich class now, because everyone has access to a paediatrician and regularly inoculate their children,"" said a school trustee.

Another trustee, who also owns a college, said that the mass vaccination programme is perfect for students in NMC and zilla parishad schools as 'they may not have access to private health care'. ""I fully support the government's initiative and it must focus on students who are normally deprived of such immunization programmes. I am sure there would even be private unaided schools in city whose students would be in need of this important vaccine, hence the best option would be for government to contact schools and seek parents' consent,"" he said.

Officials who are part of the immunization drive say there is no question of taking consent for this. Dr Mohd. Sajid, who's part of the core team looking after the drive in Nagpur, said, ""It's like chlorination of drinking water, no consent is necessary. Also it does not matter if child has taken two doses in advance, as this is as additional dose. In fact I have discussed this issue with a few schools and told them to inform parents, but there is no mention of parental consent even in the government guideline.""

He added that the drive must be viewed as a 'community level' health intervention. ""If even a single child is left behind then he could be a potential carrier of the virus,"" said Dr Sajid.

But a principal told TOI that getting consent from parents is crucial. ""Parents nowadays are very aware and aggressive when it comes to rights of their children, and we can't fault them for that. Already a handful of parents are approaching teachers and wanting to know if the school will allow the immunization programme. And I am sure by this month's end every single parent will be asking that question,"" she said. In April this year, almost 40 schools in Gurugram too refused to participate in it in the immunization drive, citing lack of consent of parents.

Paediatricians in city are already giving out MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) combo vaccination to children and it is part of the schedule chart too. A school principal said, ""Since private doctors are already giving the vaccine, I feel parents in top schools will keep their kids away from the mass vaccination drive.""","Parental consent needed for mass rubella immunization drive: Private schools - Times of India","960882791","2018-10-03","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nagpur/parental-consent-needed-for-mass-rubella-immunization-drive-private-schools/articleshow/66060515.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4304","","Srinagar: School going children crave for holidays. It's a turn off on a different level altogether when there is a national holiday and they are still supposed to attend classes.

Gandhi Jayanti, India's National Holiday is one such holiday for students of some private educational institutions in Kashmir. There is no alternative for them and the authorities despite knowing fail to address the issue.

While the government offices, educational institutions and banks stay closed today to celebrate Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi's birthday, also celebrated as International Day of Non-Violence, some private educational institutions including Doon International (DIS), Presentation Convent (PCS), New Convent and Oasis School continue to work today. While students were called to DIS and PCS, in some other schools the teachers were called up to do the 'paperwork'.

""We received a message from the school yesterday informing that the school will remain closed on 1st October and that 2nd October will be a regular working day,"" says a parent who ward studies in DIS.

Adding, he asks, ""This is not the only time when they have opposed the government order. When the government declares summer or winter holidays, they make sure to stretch the working days by 10 to 15 days. Gandhi Jayanti is a National Holiday! If we are following all rules that Delhi frames, why not holidays?""

The parent had also approached the authorities once by lodging a complaint in Chief Minister's Grievance Cell regarding announcing of winter vacations in accordance with government orders. However, he says, ""Probably, the school has 'influences'. That is how they survive despite opposing the government orders.""

He says that he never received a response from the cell. However, some government official had been to the school after some days which again, ""was of no use.""

""They went there for inspection and still they closed the school after 3 days of the inspection. And guess what! No action was taken against them!"" he exclaims.

""Who are they to decide when to declare a holiday and when not to? My child would have really enjoyed the holiday at home. Now, this Jayanti makes no difference to her,"" he adds.

When asked why they keep opposing the norms, the Administrative In-charge DIS told Free Press Kashmir that the school had been closed on 1st October as a day before it had celebrated its Annual Day.

""We had celebrated our Annual Day a day before. The teachers and students were tired. So, we decided to keep Monday a holiday,"" said Mehnaz, Manager DIS. When told that the school cannot bend the rules as per their convenience, she says, ""This is for the first time that we have kept the school running on a National holiday. Otherwise, we frame out holidays as per the government order. This time, due to the Annual Day celebrations, the students had already missed classes. We needed to recover that as well.""

As far as other schools are concerned, the faculty says that they are called to school even if there is not much to do there.

""There are no students in the school. Still, we have been called to make lesson plans and do some paperwork,"" says a faculty member from Oasis School, on condition of anonymity.

""It's not that we don't want to work or that we only look for excuses to stay home. But, it's our right to stay home when there is a holiday,"" the teacher adds.

"4305","","HYDERABAD: In view of the bandh call given by Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA), most private schools in the city, irrespective of their affiliation, had declared a holiday on Friday.

TRSMA had given a bandh call protesting against the State government's decision making it mandatory for the schools to obtain No Objection Certificates from fire department, traffic control and the corporation.

While parents criticised the move and called it a ploy by the schools to further pressurise the government from acting against them in their massive profiteering, teachers were unhappy that exam schedule had to be adjusted due to the bandh.

Glendale Academy, Chirec, Future Kids, Kalpa, Brilliant High School, Slate the School and Kennedy High the Global School were among the schools which were shut on Friday, either supporting the bandh call or declared holiday as a precautionary measure.

Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) condemned the bandh call for not just disrupting academic schedule but also involving the students in a fight that's not theirs.HSPA in a statement said that it was ""unbelievable... that a government which is supporting school managements on the gross violation of every single norm related to regulation of schools and fees charged would not be looking into these issues raised by schools.""

Ashish Naredi, a parent, said that schools are projecting that parents and teachers are supporting their demands.""This is false and if schools are so concerned about the welfare then they should they implement GO MS 1 and give 50 per cent of the fee as salaries to teachers and constitute parents teachers association. But all they do is muzzle teachers voices if they protest by sacking them and that of parents by harassing students,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the teaching community too felt the bandh was ill-timed with examinations ongoing in most schools and in others commencing from next week. Abdul Moiz, from a private school in Old City, said that despite requests from the principal of his school TRSMA did not reconsider the dates.","TRSMA bandh: Private schools stay closed, parents and teachers upset","957236813","2018-09-28","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2018/sep/29/trsma-bandh-private-schools-stay-closed-parents-and-teachers-upset-1878594.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

It wanted the government to grant Rs 30,000 per annum as education voucher to every child through direct benefit transfers. The association also demanded that the State provide free health insurance and double bedroom houses for teachers working in private schools. ""We have been pressing for our demands, but in vain.

"4307","","The higher education system's mandate is to provide equitable and affordable quality opportunities to all who deserve and desire such education. Given the mind-boggling scale of the demand, the private sector's participation is definitely a welcome move. India has one of the world's largest higher education systems, but it is still not adequate. Since 2003, India has apparently been adding more than 1,000 private colleges every year. Lacking in quality control, this expansion did not quite contribute to skill development or boost the nation's 'knowledge economy', and the private sector mostly remained the second-rate, fallback option for the desperate. As the number of 'educated' unemployed kept on growing, some of these teaching shops died their natural death.

In recent years, however, some old private brands have been re-inventing themselves, with fresh investments in quality faculty and research, scholarships and so on. The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent philanthropic interventions. More such interventions are needed for paradigm-shifting experimentation towards excellence, which the government often cannot risk as it spends taxpayers' money and is hence bound by safe rules. Students in Indian institutions have traditionally studied subjects in silos, as the system mostly did not allow for the multidisciplinary and int­erdisciplinary approach to learning.

The new standards have primarily been defined by a few independent ­philanthropic ­interventions.

Realising much ahead of the herd that real problems need real solutions, the Shiv Nadar University started in 2011 with a multidisciplinary, 'liberal studies' curriculum, offering an excellent mix of science, engineering and social science teaching and research. One can't be a problem-solving engineer, for example, without understanding the social context. Similarly, policy-making on key iss­ues often needs to be science-driven -- a slightly expensive proposition, as cutting-edge science and technology research often needs heavy resources. But there cannot be any short-cuts if we wish to deliver what is needed.

Learning has to be curiosity-driven and enjoyable. The 'liberal studies' app­roach allows learners to experiment and find their passion. With the job market changing fast, critical thinking and creative problem-solving are key skills we need to impart. In the new institutions, curriculum content is dynamic and flexible, and the mode of delivery active or participatory, with students 'learning by doing'. Even undergraduate students are encouraged to grasp the nua­nces of research and innovation, while we stre­ngthen their foundation with a broad multidisciplinary approach and provide a depth of learning in a major subject.

And yet a growing number of fee-paying Indian students go abroad even at the undergraduate level -- the high cost is not a deterrent. While 'reputation management' is a serious issue, to build people's trust in India being a safe and welcoming country, we need to go for ser­ious accreditation and benchmarking of our institutions to make our country a higher-education destination. We need to hold all the institutions accountable in a transparent, fair and progressive manner. Private institutions have strong ­in-built internal accountability. We should bring in healthy competition to the public- and private-funded universities. Global rankings are one way, but their focus on uniformity of parameters may narrow the diversity that universities need for innovation in every sphere -- in strategy, curricula, pedagogy and research. We should find and retain some unique advantages of the Indian higher education system.

The country urgently needs a global and contextual vision plan, and a competent leadership with the necessary res­ources to carry the plan through. The system needs to be rebuilt with strong, equitable and credible partnerships -- national and international, academic and industrial, public and private -- bes­ides intra-institution (interdisciplinary) to inter-institution collaborations for inn­ovation and research excellence, capacity-­building and training the trainers, better teaching tools, enhancing students' employability, and connecting education to issues of livelihood and sustainability of future generations. This is the only way forward.

They claimed that Telangana cannot have different rules for government and private schools.

According to a TOI report, the management has alleged that private schools are being discriminated against with such rules which are not applicable to government schools, thus demanding for equal treatment.

The management of private schools said that such demands of the state will lead to nearly 600 schools in the state to remain closed every year, which in turn will have serious repercussions for the economically backward sections of the society and their access to quality education.

They have further questioned the state's decision of allocating entire student budget to students in government schools only, alleging that it is the state's responsibility to provide free education to each and every student.","Private Schools in Telangana to Remain Shut Today Over 'Safety Certificates'","956581912","2018-09-28","https://www.news18.com/news/india/private-schools-in-telangana-to-remain-shut-today-over-safety-certificates-1891707.html","News18",FALSE
"4309","","NOIDA: The district administration has formed a panel to monitor and regulate private school fees in Noida and Greater Noida, just like Delhi has done.

District magistrate B N Singh told TOI on Thursday that the committee will be work under his direct supervision to regulate the fee structure of all private schools in Gautam Budh Nagar, almost a month after the UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) Act, 2018, came into effect. ""We have now received guidelines from the state government and the committee will be set up soon,"" Singh said.

The UP Self-Financed Independent Schools (Fees Regulation) ordinance was cleared by the Yogi Adityanath government on April 3, 2018, and signed by the governor on April 9. And on August 30, the ordinance was replaced with a law that was passed by a voice vote in the state assembly.

According to provisions of the Act, which covers all private CBSE, ICSE and state board-affiliated schools, all private schools that charge more than Rs 20,000 annually will have to revise their fee structure for all classes so as to bring down the financial burden on parents.

Moreover, admission fee can be charged only twice -- when a student joins school and after they complete Class X and seek admission for Class XI, according to the Act.

Schools also can't change uniform for five years. Fees charged by a school during 2015-16 will be the basis for implementing the regulation, the Act states.

Apart from the district magistrate, the committee will have a chartered accountant, a PWD executive engineer-rank official and a senior official from the UP State Finance and Accounts Services. It will also include a representative of parents association, a principal or manager of a self-financed school and the district inspector of schools.

Once the committee is set up in the district, officials said, it will address the complaints by parents regarding arbitrary fee hike and also work on putting a cap of the upper limits of fees that private schools can charge. Schools can be fined Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakh on first and second offence, respectively. Following this, it can be de-recognised.

The private school managements, who have been asking the state to stop demanding fire, traffic and other NOCs (no objection certificates) for issuing ETR's (extension of temporary registrations), said the state cannot have different rules for private and government schools.

""If private schools have to submit NOCs from fire and traffic departments as well as Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation for safety purposes, the same should also be implemented for government schools. They can't mandate something like this in the name of safety only for private schools. Also, these rules were formulated only a few years back, whereas many of these schools were established about 20-30 years ago. It is not fair to ask these schools to follow rules that are practically impossible to implement,"" said S Madhusudhan Reddy, president, TRSMA, Hyderabad, adding that all the 10,000 private schools in the state will participate in the bandh.

The managements of private schools said if the state wants schools to get these NOCs, every year about 600 schools will be forced to remain closed, which in turn will deprive economically backward students of the opportunity of a quality education.

They further said that the state cannot allocate the entire education budget only for students studying in government schools as it is their responsibility to provide free education to each and every student. ""When 55% of students are studying in private schools, it doesn't make any sense to allocate the entire budget only for students studying in government schools. Instead, they should give Rs 30,000 to each student through direct beneficiary transfer (DBT) and let the students and their parents opt for a school of their choice,"" said K Uma Maheswar Rao, general secretary, TRSMA.

"4311","","KOLKATA: Private schools, which have suspended classes and called off exams slated for Wednesday, fearing disruption on road owing to the 12-hour bandh called by the BJP, seem to have rubbed state education minister Partha Chatterjee the wrong way. Chatterjee said on Tuesday evening that if any institute defied the state circular to remain open on Wednesday, the government might probe all the allegations against them, their affiliated board notwithstanding.

The minister's statements put the schools in dilemma, forcing them to remain mum on the subject, even after most of them had informed the students and guardians in the morning about their decision to suspend classes or defer exams.

""Some private schools have decided to stay closed. We have already urged them to keep them open. I am again requesting them to keep the schools open. There is no need to worry. The central government is not in power here. If you close the institutions, then later, several others might force them to close their school at the minutest instance, even when the situation is normal. We are beside you. Keep schools open,"" Chatterjee told reporters. He later alerted the schools: ""We will provide all kind of security to schools that are fearing to remain open. If they feel they may not be able to ply their school buses safely, we will ensure adequate security. But, why postpone examinations? We are taking it seriously. Despite our requests, if they close their schools, we will not take any responsibility in any incident that may occur in their school.""

DPS Ruby Park and Ashok Hall Group of Schools have postponed their exams slated for Wednesday. While DPS Ruby Park called off classes for the primary section, Mahadevi Birla World Academy has suspended all the classes. ""We have no other option but to suspend classes because our school buses won't ply. We will postpone the practical examinations of senior school and call off the classes,"" said Mahadevi Birla World Academy principal Anjana Saha. La Martiniere for Boys has advanced its dispersal timings.

As soon as the schools decided to postpone exams and suspend classes, Chatterjee issued a diktat to keep their schedule unchanged. The school authorities, however, declined to comment.

Chatterjee pointed out they might might be affiliated to ICSE or CBSE, but the schools had to take NOCs from the state. ""We have never interfered in any unfortunate incident, which had happened in some of the schools. They could have taken suggestions from the school education department. We have issued a circular to keep the schools open. Despite our requests, if some schools decide to defy our orders, we shall probe the activities of private schools affiliated to other boards, which we have not done till now,"" the minister said.

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh muddled the issue further: ""Who will take the responsibility if buses do not ply and something untoward happens on the streets?

As many as 25 mobile vans and the same number of flying squads will ply the streets. The state government also assured it will provide protection to everyone who will be out to foil the bandh. Vehicles, if damaged, would be compensated by the government.

State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee accused the BJP of stalling development in the state by calling the bandh.

""The police will take strong action if anyone tries to enforce the strike. Our party workers have also been instructed to remain alert and monitor the situation but they they must not respond to provocations. All DMs and SPs have been asked to take action if situation goes out of hand,"" he said.

""We have got reports that some private schools have decided to remain closed tomorrow and some of them have postponed their scheduled examinations. I will once again appeal to them to open their institute... We will give full protection to the students and all those who will come out tomorrow.

The BJP, on the other hand, said the state government was ""forcefully"" trying to foil the bandh.

"4315","","To ensure admission of students from economically weaker sections (EWS) to private schools, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), formerly known as the Haryana Urban Development Authority or Huda, has asked 34 schools that come under the jurisdiction of the Estate Office 1 to submit the details regarding the number of students admitted under this category.

The schools have obtained land from the authority at concessional rates, and, as such, are obliged to admit EWS students.

The authority sought the information on September 11 and also asked the schools to submit the fee structure and mode of admission for EWS students, among other things.

Further, the notice issued to the schools has directed them to submit the reply within a stipulated time period, or face action.

The HSVP had, on June 21, also issued directions that as per the allotment policy, the urban authority officials would be included in the management committee of the school to oversee the EWS admission process. It had nominated executive engineers Bhoop Singh and Rameshwar Das for schools falling under Estate Office 1, whereas executive engineers Shweta Sharma and Anil Kumar were appointed for those under Estate Office 2. Officials, however, have confirmed that none of the schools has included them in their committees. It is because of this reason that the HSVP has issued notices to 34 schools.

Earlier, the urban authority had taken similar action against three major private hospitals in the city asking them to furnish details of EWS patients treated by them as per the policy.

The HSVP administrator of Gurugram, Chander Shekhar Khare, said that he was working to streamline the EWS admission process in private schools as he had observed very good work being done in this regard in Faridabad.

All government and private schools will remain closed in the tribal district of Kinnaur on Monday as per the directions issued by Deputy Commissioner Gopal Chand, an official said Sunday.

Similarly, all private and government schools as well colleges and ITIs will remain closed Monday in Kullu district, Deputy Commissioner Yunus said.

Yunus said students would not be required to come to their education institutions but teaching and non-teaching staff would remain present in their respective institutions.

Presiding over a meeting held to review monsoon-related losses and damages, the CM said 199 of the 264 deaths took place in accidents on damaged roads.

Himachal suffered a total loss of Rs 1,217.29 crores due to excessive rains, flash floods and cloudburst incidents, Thakur said, adding that the state government would soon submit a memorandum of losses and damages to the Centre for financial aid.

Himachal Pradesh Public Works Department (HPPWD) incurred a loss of Rs 735 crore due to the rains in the form of damages to roads, bridges, breast walls and retaining walls, he added.

Thakur said although the maximum damage was caused by heavy rains, unplanned dumping of debris was also to blame.

He said it was important to ensure that the debris was disposed off at designated places in a planned manner. Effective cross drainage and side drainage facilities should be maintained to ensure a proper drainage system, he added.

The school education department started re-verification of documents after a scam in issuance of extension of temporary recognition (ETR) to 14 private schools in the city was unearthed earlier this year. While the department suspended seven officials for issuing bogus ETRs, it is carrying inspections and verifying documents of all other schools.

"4320","","Hyderabad: After successfully launching Aadhaar based biometric attendance in select government schools across the State, focus is now on launching the same in private schools.

The Directorate of School Education is planning to implement the Aadhaar based biometric attendance in private and corporate schools. The new system is being planned for both students and teachers on a pilot basis to regulate attendance and weed out fake enrolments.

Officials of the Directorate of School Education are of the view that Aadhaar based biometric attendance would also aid in preparing Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) data with ease. According to the statistics available with the directorate, about 11,262 private unaided schools are functioning in the State with 31,19,525 enrolments.

""As per provisions in the GO MS 1, the department has the authority to regulate and inspect private schools. The biometric attendance will be implemented as part of the regulations,"" an official said.

For regulating schemes like midday meals and to improve the attendance of students and teachers, the directorate has commenced installing 12,700 biometric systems in 9,349 government and local body schools in 12 districts in the State on a pilot basis. A biometric machine is being provided to schools with a strength of 100 students and managements have been instructed to record students' attendance before serving the midday meal while for teaching and non-teaching staff it will be done in the mornings and evenings.

The programme is being implemented in collaboration with the Unique Identification Authority of India and State Information Technology Department. The IT Department has developed a software for dashboard to monitor attendance in real time. So far, attendance of more than 10,000 students studying in the government and local body schools is being monitored through the dashboard.

Speaking to Telangana Today, Telangana Recognised School Managements Association president S Sreenivas Reddy said the private schools have already installed biometric machines for recording the attendance of teachers.

"4321","","A set of non-negotiable child safety rules for schools is the need of the hour.

The recent gang rape of a girl in a Dehradun school has once again raised questions regarding safety and security of schoolchildren. Known for their quality of education, private schools in Uttarakhand attract students from all over the country. However, there are visible gaps in formation, implementation and monitoring of safety measures in the private schools.

SC Guidelines

As per the Supreme Court guidelines on child safety in schools, a school management should install sufficient CCTV cameras on campus, facing road and and periphery. When a team of Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) inspected the school where the gang rape took place, it did not find CCTV cameras in hostels. The UCPCR team also found that the girls' hostel, housing 22 students, did not have any warden for a month.

The Supreme Court guidelines also state that all areas of the school premises should be regularly monitored and any unauthorised person should be questioned for their presence. School management is also required to appoint some staff as vigilance monitors on rotation to keep an eye on all activities of students. However, these are guidelines. A set of non-negotiable child safety conditions for schools is still awaited.

Accountability

Welham Boys' School principal Guneet Bindra said, ""When parents leave their children in a residential school, school authorities become their pseudo parents. We have to care for each and every child as our own. This includes taking care of their health, hygiene, safety and well-being.""

Bindra said negligence of any kind by a school in the safety of a child is unacceptable. ""Internal security of a school is vital and cannot be compromised.""

Safety in schools

In October last year, the principals' progressive school association (PPSA) issued a safety advisory to all its 176 member schools of Dehradun. These included installing CCTV cameras and their regular monitoring, police verification of all employees, advising parents not to drop off their children to school too early or pick them up too late and an entry system of each student, preferably in the form of biometric. The advisory also stated that no area of the school should be left unattended.

""The members of the association meet annually to discuss issues of safety and security of the children. We also ensure that all the member schools follow the guidelines that we have laid down,"" president of PPSA Prem Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

""However, the school where this unfortunate incident took place is not a member of PPSA and I have never visited the campus as well. So I do not know how they were operating,"" Kashyap said. He said PPSA has 36 schools which are both day and boarding.

Case of ICSE schools

Jennifer Kumar, Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) school association's state president, said: ""ICSE has issued guidelines for safety of students, which we abide by. There are periodic inspections by members of the council to monitor the same."" She said security of a student was of 'paramount importance', irrespective of which examination board the school is affiliated with.","Dehradun rape: Safety of students in private schools questionable","950494382","2018-09-19","https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/dehradun-safety-of-students-in-private-schools-questionable/story-dzFF4QB1Vky00oBaEyvs6J.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"4322","","FFC urges parents to come forward, submit complaints for action

Days after the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) issued a suspension notice against two private schools here the Fee Fixation Committee (FFC) Tuesday said they have received fresh complaints against some more private schools for charging exorbitant fee in violation of its directives.

Chairman of FFC, Justice (Retd) Hakim Imtiyaz Hussain said the committee has received some new complaints against private schools for violating its recommended fee structure.

Hussain said FFC has received complaints from the parents of students enrolled in Minto Circle School, Srinagar who are 'violating' the FFC norms by charging exorbitant fee from them.

Meanwhile another member of FFC wishing anonymity told Rising Kashmir that it has received a complaint from the parents against Linton Hall School, Rajbagh for the same issue.

According to FFC, they have recommended Rs 1200 for Linton Hall School, Rajbagh but in violation of norms the school is charging Rs 1350 per month.

When asked about the recent suspension orders to RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh, Hussain said, ""We had informed both the school authorities to charge only recommended fee, but they did not adhere to that. The complaints of those schools were received by FFC and DSEK.""

The parents of various schools told Rising Kashmir that they want to register complaints against the private schools who violate the norms of FFC but they are unaware of the process to do so. The parents said they want to know whether they can file complaints online.

However, the chairman of FFC blamed the parents for not filing complaints against those schools who are violating FFC guidelines. ""We cannot act against any school till we have a genuine complaint or proof against it. In today's meeting we have told our Chief Education Officers (CEO) to conduct inspection of all schools who are violating the FFC norms,"" FFC chairman said.

Replying to a query he said, ""All the private schools are violating the norms but only those are caught and highlighted against whom the complaints have been filed by the parents. Parents fear reprisal but we assure them their complaints are kept confidential.""

FFC Chairman added that they have regulated the tuition fee structure of various prominent schools which includes DPS Srinagar, Presentation Convent, Mallinson and Tyndale Biscoe School, Burn Hall School and many other schools.

He said the missionary schools like Biscoe and Mallinson charge Rs 35,000 as admission fee and for the whole year they charge Rs 85,000 which includes tuition fee, transport fee and other charges as well.

""RP School or Green Valley cannot be compared with DPS Srinagar because the Supreme Court in its guidelines had mentioned that the school with more facilities can charge accordingly,"" Hussain said.

He further said that for RP School FFC has recommended Rs 1370 as monthly tuition fee but they are charging Rs 1900 which is a violation of FFC guidelines.

""Similarly, Green Valley Educational Institute has a good amount of surplus money and that is why we told them that why they are charging more than what FFC has recommended,"" he added.","Complaints against 2 more private schools filed by parents ","949631316","2018-09-18","http://risingkashmir.com/news/complaints-against-2-more-private-schools-filed-by-parents-","RisingKashmir",FALSE
"4323","","CHENNAI: For the first time in recent years, there has been a drop in number of students admitted to private schools under the Right of Children for Free & Compulsory Education (RTE) Act.

Despite receiving record number of applications from candidates across Tamil Nadu, only 70,000 managed to get admissions in private schools under the 25% RTE quota, according to official data.

""This is because the admission guidelines were revised this year. Only those residing within 1km radius of the schools were considered for the admission process,"" a state school education department official told TOI on condition of anonymity.

Until last year, applications from those within 3km or 5km radius were considered during the second or subsequent rounds of admissions.

Explaining the rationale behind this decision, the official said the Centre had not only denied reimbursement claims made for admissions made under the said act in kindergarten sections but also delayed releasing the promised funds.

""Every year, the state had to spend over and above its allocated budget to bridge this funding gap,"" he said.

Corroborating this, minutes of the recent Samagara Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) project approval board meeting suggest that the state had sought Rs 99 crore as total reimbursement towards expenditure incurred for 25 % admission under RTE quota in 2015-16.

But the central government (HRD ministry) has sanctioned only Rs 27.6 crore approximately one-fourth of the proposal, show records.

Commenting on this, V Eswaran from MDMK party, also an RTE activist, said, ""Other states including Maharashtra increase the radius to 3km or 5km if the seats remain vacant. So when there is a provision to do so, the government can't cite shortage of funds as a reason to revise guidelines.""

""Instead, the government can fix the loopholes in admitting students from disadvantaged groups (SC/ST/BC/MBC) to make the scheme more efficient. These students become eligible only by submitting a community certificate. So, even the affluent managed to study for free,"" he told.

According to section 12 (1)(c) of the act, 25 % seats in private schools are reserved for students aged between 8 to 14, belonging to weaker sections (with an annual income of less than Rs 2 lakh) and disadvantaged groups.

Eswaran added if the RTE Act doesn't accept KG admissions, then the state should instruct private schools to readmit them in Class I and submit these applications for reimbursement.","Drop in admission to private schools under RTE - Times of India","948916982","2018-09-18","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/drop-in-admission-to-pvt-schools-under-rte/articleshow/65849094.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4324","","A section of parents has alleged that the state education department has conspicuously attacked schools which are teaching Islamic practices to students.

The department of school education, Kashmir has de-recognised two prominent private schools in downtown Srinagar on September 15.

However, the decision has turned out to be controversial as parents of the schoolchildren claim that it could damage the academic career of their kids. The schools facing the axe are RP School and Green Valley Educational Institute located in Malla Bagh, an area in downtown Srinagar.

Although the reason mentioned by the education department officials behind the de-recognition is the exorbitant fee charged by the school management, a section of the parents allege that the decision by the administration could be a crackdown on schools that are teaching Islamic moral education.

The posts on social media in support of the school administrations have now gone viral. This indicates that the present state administration may be opposed to the idea of teaching Islamic education in valley schools.

Social media users posted pictures of the students offering Namaz (Islamic prayers) and women teachers and students clad in Hijab and Burqa on school premises. They also claimed that the state administration under the garb of exorbitant fees did not want the preaching of Islamic practices among students.

""Fee hikes are a norm in all big schools. But singling out a school where Islamic education in being taught, where zuhr prayer is a must. It is disgraceful. In RP we trust. I am proud I have spent few of my years in RP. My future daughter is going to RP,"" Aafan Hakak tweeted.

A post which lays down fees sturucture of various eminent schools in the state, which includes Christian missionary schools besides others, said that the two schools which faced de-recognition comparatively charged lesser fees.

""These schools which face the suspension charge only half the amount of montly fees compared to the missionary schools and other elite institutions which are run by affluent people. This is a selective decision and there is a greater design to regulate the religious teachings among students,"" a parent, under the condition of anonymity, said.

A medico, Masood Rashid whose children are studying in RP School wrote on Fcaebook, ""I strongly condemn biased and selective action by DSEK against RP School Malabagh...My children are reading in same school...Fee structure is less than other schools or equal...I want to know who are these self-styled parent association...Who has given them consent...Who made them representatives...These self styled association people are actually extortionists and their only aim is to get extrabenifits for their own children...They usually blackmail school authorities...DSEK and pseudo parent representatives are fully responsible for whatever trauma to out-going students and their parents....""

The Department of school education, Kashmir, has however said in an official statement that the decision is only an initial step in the process of streamlining the private education sector in Kashmir and has appealed to the citizens to bring to the notice of authorities any arbitrary hike in fees by private schools.","Parents allege crackdown on Islamic teachings as 2 private schools get derecognised in Srinagar","948507227","2018-09-17","https://www.ibtimes.co.in/parents-allege-crackdown-islamic-teachings-2-private-schools-get-derecognised-srinagar-780789","International Business Times, India Edition",FALSE
"4325","","In an extraordinary measure, the Director of School Education Dr G N Itoo has suspended the recognition of RP School Mallabagh and Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahibagh for exorbitant fee hike and non-compliance of orders from the Department. Director School Education has also called for adjusting the enrolled students of these schools in nearby Government schools for ensuing examination. Itoo has also cautioned all the heads of the private institutions not to hike the fee on their own and comply with the instructions and orders from the department, in letter and spirit. Though slammed for being harsh in some quarters, the decision has come as a shot in the arm of the parents who are otherwise largely taken for granted by the management of the private schools and made to pay through their nose. So, the extreme action by the government is certain to lend them some sense of empowerment. And in future they won't find themselves solely at the mercy of the school managements who don't shy away from forcing the parents to pay up the entire fees even in times of disasters like the 2014 deluge. One could hope that the government action reigns in the private schools which have otherwise become a law unto themselves.

Last year, the state government's school fee fixation committee has given a nod to the enhancement of fee structure of private educational institutions by eight percent. The order issued in October last is valid for three years. The decision came after the J&K High Court directed the state government to frame a policy regarding annual fee enhancement. But as the derecognized two schools would have us believe, the government's orders are observed largely in breach. The schools would easily get away with their arbitrary fee hikes, cocking a snook at the government. And parents are in no position to resist this.

But again the people are bound to watch Itoo's order with some scepticism. Will the new action succeed where the previous initiatives have failed? Only time will tell. But the outcome of the past interventions should hardly detract from the significance of the fresh measure. Director School Education has the power to get private schools to fall in line. He is in a position to withdraw the recognition should schools refuse to do his bidding as he has now practically demonstrated.

Ideally, the private schools, especially the elite schools, should have taken the lead and in a spirit of mutual understanding worked with the parents to fix a mutually agreed amount of fees. But this isn't happening. And now the government has taken a note of this arbitrary state of affairs and acted with suspension of the recognition of the two schools. But it needs to follow it up with actions that make a visible difference on the ground. More so, in a situation where private school managements have not been enough socially responsible to act on their own.","Holding Private Schools Accountable","948234769","2018-09-17","https://kashmirobserver.net/2018/editorial/holding-private-schools-accountable-36099","Kashmir Observer",FALSE

Warning strict action against private schools in Uttarakhand prescribing non-NCERT books, the director general of primary education department has said it may even lead to cancellation of their no-objection certificates (NOCs).

On Thursday, the department served notices to 186 private schools of the state affiliated to Central Board for Secondary Education (CBSE) in this regard. The state government had taken a decision earlier this year to make books by National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) compulsory for all private CBSE schools of the state. This decision was also backed by the high court in April.

Alok Shekhar Tiwari, director general of primary education, said: ""This matter will not be taken lightly. We have issued notices to these schools and have sought their reply. The schools have acted against the high court verdict, which is contempt of court and we will bring this to the court's notice.

We will also seek the court's guidelines on further action. If the court so instructs, we will withdraw the NOCs of these schools and will register an FIR against them as well.""

CBSE grants affiliation to a school only if it has an NOC by the state government. Tiwari said the department cannot proceed in the matter independently as it is sub-judice.

In its judgment, the court had said that if a school is prescribing books from private publishers, they should be at par with the NCERT books in terms of quality and cost. Schools cannot prescribe books from private publishers which cost more than NCERT books.

After receiving several complaints from the parents, education minister Arvind Pandey constituted nodal officers in Dehradun, Haridwar, Nainital and Udham Singh Nagar to survey all the private schools in their respective districts and identify the defaulters.

The officers found 186 out of 226 private schools in violation of the high court order.

""The schools have been trying to defend themselves by saying that the books by private publishers are for their library but it is baseless. If these books are for the library, then why have the parents been made to buy them in addition to the NCERT books? This has led to extra financial burden on the parents,"" Tiwari said.

Deputy director, primary education, Jitendra Saxena, said: ""We have served notices to these schools on the basis of nine points.

The Uttarakhand Commission for Protection of Child Rights (UCPCR) has received over 70 complaints this year against private schools allegedly violating provisions of the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

Usha Negi, chairman of UCPCR, said, ""We have received many complaints against private schools of the state flouting the RTE Act. Many schools are demanding fees from students admitted under RTE. Several students are harassed by the school authorities as well.""

The commission has received complaints against prominent private schools, including Scholars Home, Moravian Institute, Doon World School and Doon Sarla Academy. In the various complaints, all four schools have been accused of demanding money from students enrolled under RTE Act.

While complaint against Scholars Home and Doon Sarla Academy stated that they were demanding a monthly fee ranging from Rs 500-1,000 from students under RTE and not giving a receipt of the same, parents of a student from Doon World School produced a 'Fee Card' issued by the school which recorded the monthly charges taken from the child.

As per a complaint registered by the parents of a student from Moravian Institute, the school had been demanding fees from the Class 5 student. Unable to pay the fees, the parents asked the school for the transfer certificate (TC) of their ward. The complaint said that the school refused to issue the TC until the parents cleared the pending dues. The child had been admitted to the school in Class 1 in May 2014.

A hearing was held between both the parties, following which the commission demanded an affidavit from the school stating their version. ""The school granted the TC without charging the parents,"" said Kamal Gupta, spokesperson of the commission.

The commission has also received complaints where private schools refuse to give admission to students under RTE Act. ""We got some complaints from Haridwar where private schools like Shivam Academy English Medium School refused to give admission to students under RTE Act. There have been reports of children being manhandled by teachers or school authorities in Haridwar,"" Gupta said.

Usha Negi said that while the commission is acting upon the grievances that are raised with them, in many cases, parents are too scared to even file a complaint. ""We have got to know that a prominent private school of Dehradun has given special identity cards to students admitted under RTE Act.

While the Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to introduce concepts such as no bag day, reducing the weight of the bag, and banning homework for lower primary classes, private school managements in the State have strongly opposed them.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka (KAMS), said many of these initiatives were ""unscientific and not practical"".

Other members of the All Boards Association, which includes State board as well as CBSE schools, too were of the same opinion.

Homework

B.R. Supreeth, office-bearer of the Management of Independent CBSE Schools, said schools had evolved homework to ensure it was only a recap of the things learnt in the classroom. ""Teachers do not ask students to write impositions like how they used to do earlier. We give meaningful homework that supplements classroom learning. The State government should not ban homework,"" he said.

Mr. Shashi Kumar said it was not practical for all schools to have a locker facility for students. ""The department can recommend that schools have lockers so that students can keep their belongings. But this cannot be imposed on budget private schools,"" he said.

He said the government had not considered their inputs before evolving various policies. School managements are willing to implement no bag day once a month, he added. He urged the department to declare second Saturday as holiday for students so that they get time to spend with their family.

CM's intervention sought

Private school managements sought the Chief Minister's intervention, claiming that Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh was not available to listen to their grievances.

""There are several issues pertaining to reimbursement of RTE quota admissions and supply of textbooks that need to be addressed.

At a press conference on Tuesday, D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said, ""We are all now complying with the fee structure and all our member schools will display it from December.""

He said the move aims to bring in accountability and transparency. This has been the long-standing demand of parents. Schools that do not comply with the fee structure can be penalised up to ₹10 lakh.

For several years, school managements have been violating the fee structure policy, terming it ""archaic"".

According to the new fee structure, besides recurring costs, school managements can charge an additional fee that differs based on the location -- ranging from 70% of the recurring fee in gram panchayat and town panchayat limits to about 100% in Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike areas. The special development fee has been raised to ₹2,500 from ₹600. Schools also are not allowed to hike the fees by more than 15% from the previous academic year.

Suchitra S., whose child is studying in class 3, welcomed the move. ""We have been demanding this for several years now. This empowers parents as we can complain if schools do not comply with the fee structure displayed.""

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights had also asked parents to lodge complaints with them if schools were violating the fee structure policy.","Fee structure to be displayed in private schools from December","944391827","2018-09-11","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/fee-structure-to-be-displayed-in-private-schools-from-december/article24929402.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"4332","","PATNA: Deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi said on Wednesday the government would pass a bill in the assembly to regulate the fee charged by the private schools in Bihar.

Addressing a Teachers' Day programme organized at SK Memorial Hall, Modi said the 50% reservation for women in teachers' job in Bihar had increased their numbers to 40% in 2018 against 19% earlier. ""The state government has also increased the government schoolteacher's salary from Rs5,000 in 2006 to Rs22,000-Rs27,000 in 2018,"" he said.

"4333","","BHUBANESWAR: The State Government has decided to include all private schools in the deworming campaign scheduled on National Deworming Day on September 19 and the subsequent mop-up round on September 26. As many as 1.42 crore children and adults in the age group of 1 to 19 will be administered Albendazole during the State level drive to prevent intestinal worm infections. A biannual Vitamin A supplementation programme will also be implemented during the period.

As per the ninth annual status of education report 2014, 29 per cent of total enrolments at the national level are in private schools. In Odisha, the percentage of private school admissions is 8.5. The drive will be conducted in 27 districts and aligned with mass drug administration in the rest three lymphatic districts of Cuttack, Khurda and Dhenkanal. Children from one to five years of age will be administered Albendazole suspension and those in the age bracket of six to 19 will be given tablet. Pre-school and school kids are at the risk of parasitic intestinal worm infections - Soil-Transmitted Helminths (STH). Worms can cause anaemia and nutritional impairment, thereby affecting mental and physical development.

As estimated by the national centre for disease control, the STH rate in Odisha is 38 per cent. Parasitic infections result from poor sanitation as well as unhygienic conditions and are easily transmitted to children through contact with infected soil. A health official said mass deworming leads to significant improvement in outcomes related to education, career choice, earnings and long-term well being. Since the consequences of chronic worm infection in children are widespread and debilitating and kids with high intensity of STH infection are too sick to concentrate in schools or Anganwadi centres, dewo r ming is an important intervention to combat malnutrition, he said. Sources said the deworming coverage was 92 per cent during the last round in April.

The Health department has chalked out strategies to reach out-of school children and private schools in urban areas to increase the coverage and achieve the census target. Meanwhile, the Project Director of Odisha Primary Education Programme Authority (OPEPA) has sought cooperation of all district education officers, project coordinators of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) and block education officers to make the drive successful. They district officials have been urged to nominate one teacher from every school as nodal teacher for a training programme at block level.","Private schools to join Government deworming drive","936739141","2018-09-01","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/2018/sep/01/private-schools-to-join-government-deworming-drive-1865831.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE
"4334","","NEW DELHI: If you want to reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), intervention must start from school itself. A group of researchers have recommended this following their study that shows one out of every 10 students of Delhi's private schools suffer from obesity, high blood pressure and increased levels of bad cholesterol.

Together, these risk factors make them vulnerable to develop a host of non-communicable diseases, primarily cardiovascular diseases (like heart attacks and stroke), cancer, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructed pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. They are the major cause of adult mortality and illness worldwide.

The students of government schools, who come from lower socio-economic strata, are relatively less vulnerable to get these diseases, the study conducted by researchers from AIIMS, Public Health Foundation of India, Indian Institute of Health Management and Research and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says. It has been published in Preventive Medicine Reports (PMR).

The research involved screening of 1369, 786 boys and 543 girls -- studying in grades II and XI in 10 randmly selected private schools and nine government schools.

The percentage of overweight and obese students among private schools was 13% and 9% respectively. Among the government school students, only 3% students were found to be overweight and none of them were found to be obese. Number of underweight students in government schools was, however, noted to be three times that of the private school students.

Hypertension and bad cholesterol, risk factors usually associated with increasing age and unhealthy lifestyle, was also found to be affecting the students.

In the study, the prevalence of hypertensive students in private schools was 13% and in government schools it was 4.5%. Monika Arora, the lead author of the study told TOI, this is the first research to report on the distribution of multiple risk factors for NCDs in school students in India, comparing low socio-economic status (government schools) to high socio-economic status (private schools).

""Private school students had 29 times the prevalence of obese students compared to government schools,"" she said. Arora blamed sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy eating for the increased risk and stressed on the need for comprehensive, school-based interventions to promote healthy lifestyle among them.

Harvard School of Public Health has, in a study on economic losses due to non-communicable diseases, has estimated the economic burden of these ailments for India will be close to $6.2 trillion for 2012-30, a figure that is nearly nine times the total health expenditure during the previous 19 years of $710 billion.","1 in 10 kids in private schools is obese, has high BP - Times of India","936719145","2018-09-01","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/1-in-10-kids-in-pvt-schools-is-obese-has-high-bp/articleshow/65629838.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

High demand for admissions

Despite there being 35 private schools in the district, parents seem to prefer the Zilla Parishad High School in Bakhalwada colony. Unable to handle the number of applications for admission, this school has put up a ""no admissions"" board at the entrance. In the last few years, admissions get filled within the first week of June in this school. The High School has 796 students studying between classes 6 and 10 who are accommodated in 35 classrooms. There are two sections for Telugu students and three for English in each class. The school has 46 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching staff, a library, science lab and playground apart from other facilities. ""Last three years, we secured 100 per cent pass in Class-X examinations,"" says the school headmaster Banda Venkat Reddy. While the school is 'almost perfect' the headmaster has urged the government to construct a kitchen where midday meals can be cooked.

'Train' them for future!

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders! Every since the boring school became a 'train school' dropout rates have frozen, say authorities. Also, they are seeing a sudden jump in attendance rate. Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train. ""At present, we have 270 students coming from Kancherla, Maddimall and Veernapalli villages. Since the makeover, donations have increased and we used this amount to hire two additional teachers,"" says the school headmaster Bukya Gajan. It's not just students, the school has also become a local tourist attraction with people visiting the spot to take selfies.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments.","Government schools give private peers a run for money in Telangana","935937983","2018-08-31","http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2018/aug/31/government-schools-give-private-peers-a-run-for-money-in-telangana-1865342.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

Several Private schools in Delhi have decided not to celebrate the Teachers' Day on September 5. A few of those are likely to observe a muted celebrations. The private schools have taken this decision citing ""spate of arrests"" of teachers and principals in the national capital. The school authorities also alleged that they were treated in poor, unfair manner. An association of over 160 senior secondary private schools, The National Progressive Schools' Conference (NPSC), has reportedly issued an advisory to schools.

The Affordable Private Schools' Association has also decided not to celebrate Teachers' Day on September 5. ""We, the educationist fraternity, have to restore the value in our society and respect of the teachers, so that we can bring trust in the system,"" it said in a statement. Earlier on August 21, the Springdales Education Society had sent a note stating it will not be hosting the Teachers' Day dinner this year.

The Springdales Education Society circular said this is ""owing to a series of disturbing events in schools, in and outside Delhi, where principals and teachers have been held accountable for situations that in many instances have not been the responsibility of schools and their management"". ""Teachers are being targeted on unproven allegations of a lack of safety of school children. The relationship between the school and parents, too, is merely transactional and not what we desire it to be or what it used to be,"" it said.

A survey that assessed students across 20 states revealed that 9 in 10 children in urban private schools cannot read in English.

The report, 'Where India reads 2017-18', covered 19,765 children of classes IV, V and VI in 106 private schools in cities, across 20 states, including Delhi, Karnataka, Maharashtra, West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir among others.

The survey conducted by Stones2Milestones, an organisation that aims to address the reading and learning levels of school going students. This was reviewed by Australian Council of Educational Research (ACER).

The report suggests that problem lies within our households. ""English is a second or even third language, in several Indian households and children speak in their mother tongue which is either Hindi or a regional language. However, at school they are expected to learn a language which is foreign to them, in a formal setting.""

Nikhil Saraf, co-founder, Stones2Milestones, said, ""The test was conducted online to check comprehension, vocabulary and reading habits of students under their teachers' supervision. Some students answered a few test items in an unreasonably short time. Since it is unlikely for a small child to read and respond in snap of a finger, we did not count for scoring.""

""This also points to several behavioural peculiarities, which could include reading fatigue, non-seriousness and bad monitoring practices.""

The schools were provided with a list of suggestions and actions needed to improve reading levels based on the assessment report.

""The focus should be to make reading to the core as a learning focus rather than just restrict it to a namesake library period,"" said Kavish Gadia, co-founder and CEO, Stones2Milestones.

Christel R Devadaswon, head, Department of English, University of Delhi, said, ""A policy is required to improve the literacy rate and stakeholders should look at the perspective of children and their socioeconomic situations.""

Venita Kaul, ex-senior education specialist and chairperson of the Advisory Committee of Center for Early Childhood Education and Development (CECED), said, ""I hope this report will initiate a discussion on challenges many Indian children face due to multi-lingual environment at home. It will sensitise parents, teachers and other stakeholders regarding the need to revisit classroom pedagogy for teaching reading to children. This is an urgent need in primary schools since children learn best in ways more developmentally and contextually appropriate for them. Once that is done, future assessments of children's reading skills will undoubtedly present a more favourable picture of their reading levels.""","90% students in urban private schools cannot read English: Survey - Times of India","934346187","2018-08-29","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/90-students-in-urban-private-schools-cannot-read-english-survey/articleshow/65587370.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"4341","","NEW DELHI: Indian families which send all their children to private schools spend over 4 per cent of their total expenditure more on education than a similar household which sends all its children to public schools. This is a 60 per cent increase above the average education expenditure and is financed by a reduction of expenditure on food, institutional medical care, entertainment among others.

These are some of the facts that were presented by two development researchers in a presentation titled ""How do Households Finance Private School Education?"" in an international conference on public policy and management organised by IIM, Bengaluru in New Delhi recently.

""We set out to analyse the financing patterns of private education by families because it's a common experience that even urban poor and low-income families in rural areas now prefer private schools over government schools,"" said Nishant Chadha of India Development Foundation, a researcher.

""And the findings so far, I would say, have been startling as families cut their other expenses significantly to ensure things like tuition, uniforms and recurrent fee that private schooling demands.""

The researchers used data from 68th round of National Sample Survey Office for the analysis The motivation for the analysis came from a 2015 Assocham survey which had said that nearly one in ten respondents indicated that the cost associated with schooling has actually affected even their choice of school.

Over 70 per cent of parents spend 30-40 per cent of take-home pay on their children education, placing a significant burden on their family budget, the survey had also found. ""While the annual fees are on average Rs 65,000 to Rs. 1,25,000 on a single child for regular schools, even the preschools for those aged 3 to 5 cost, parents about Rs 35,000 to Rs 75,000 a term,"" Assocham survey had said.

"4609","","TURA: RMSA Secondary school teachers from Garo Hills who are yet to be paid their salaries since July to date have urged the government to clear their dues at the earliest.

According to a statement issued here by the All Garo Hills RMSA Secondary School Teachers' Association (AGHRSSTA), it was only after submission of several memorandums and meetings with the Chief Minister that their three months' salaries the for the months from April to June was paid in September this year. However, payment for the remaining months stopped since then and altogether five months salaries from July to November remains pending.

""During the past two to three years we received our salary almost regularly and when we heard about the priority of education in the state from the new government, we were very happy. But the situation has become worse than before. What has happened to the promised now?"" the teachers said.

The association said it was unfortunate that teachers have to beg every time to get their dues and questioned the possibility of imparting quality education if they are not given any importance.

The association added that despite financial constraints, they had rendered their services and conducted the annual examination including other school activities on their own expenses in the absence of any maintenance grant for the whole year. Taking all these into consideration, the teachers urged the government to release their pending dues before Christmas.

""Non-payment of salary on a regular basis always leads to extreme difficulties for us.

Out of these 10 teachers, four are from Mansa and rest from Patiala, while six are on regular pay rolls.

Among them, Amolak Singh, leader of Elementary Teacher Training (ETT) union, who was posted in Sadda Singh Wala village, about 10 km from Mansa city, has been transferred to the last village of the district, Beerewala Dogra, 60 km away from his last posting. Hardeep Singh Sidhu, ETT union district president, said the ETT teachers cannot be transferred out of the district and hence the last village was chosen. ""Amolak is on regular rolls."" Narinder Singh, district president of government teachers' union, Mansa, was posted in Raipur village of the district. He was earlier in Tarn Taran district. Karamjeet Singh, a science teacher of Dalelwala village in Mansa, has been sent to Amritsar. He is a committee member of democratic teachers' front, Mansa, said Sidhu.

Senior vice-president of government teachers' union Gurdas Singh has been transferred to Hoshairpur from Bajewala village of Mansa. All the teachers had participated in the dharna outside the Deputy Commissioner's office in Mansa. Sidhu said as all the union leaders are active in the ongoing protest, they have been targeted. ""It is an effort to weaken out protest. However, so far no one has joined.""

Villagers also locked schools and staged protest outside them on Tuesday, demanding that the transfers of the four Mansa teachers be revoked. Though District Education Officer Subash Chandra tried to pacify the villagers by saying that teachers on deputation will be sent soon, they refused to relent, saying that the transfers were uncalled for.

On the other hand, Atinder Pal Singh Ghagga, president of DTF, Patiala, has been transferred to Hoshairpur, while Bikram Dev to Gurdaspur, Davinder Singh Poonia, convenor of Sanjha Adhiyapak Morcha, said. ""Both are on regular rolls. A few SSA/RMSA union leaders have also been transferred out. Our protest started from October 7 and is continuing.

He added, ""So far our talks with education department officials have failed."" On the other hand, the dharna continued in Patiala and teachers from across the state are joining it.

The 9,000 SSA/ RMSA teachers had been appointed over 10 years ago and after annual appraisals, their salary had reached Rs 42,800, though they were not on government rolls.

To avoid departmental action, protesting Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and jalandhar teachers have decided to take an extra hour of classes daily with only four months left for final exams.

Around 8,800 SSA and RMSA teachers have been protesting for the past three weeks across Punjab, with many of them sitting on fast unto death in Patiala.

""We are protesting only after the school timing. But, the government is still alleging that due to our protest, the studies are getting affected,"" said Gurpreet Singh, Jalandhar district president of SSA union, adding, ""To avoid any controversy over this, we have decided to take an extra hour of classes every day after the regular school timing.""

Teachers are protesting at all the places where ministers, Congress MPs, MLAs or leaders go, besides in front of their houses, against their recent regularisation, as per which their initial pay scale will be around Rs 15,000 per month, against their present monthly income of Rs 42,800, along with a three-year probation. It is only after the probation that they will get their full salary.

Government had asked these teachers to either get regularised as per the government salary norms or stay with their previous employer (SSA/ RMSA). Around 1,800 teachers out of 8,800 have opted to become regular teachers with the Punjab government on this condition.

MHRD objected to appointment process 5 yrs ago: Teachers

As the previous SAD-BJP government in Punjab had appointed these teachers by creating SSA/ RMSA societies, the protesters said that they are already teaching in government schools on contract basis, but the latter is not accepting them as their contractual employees. They said that even the central government had advised the state five years back against their appointment through a letter dated March 4, 2013. The letter from Human Resources Development Department (MHRD) said, ""It is found that in Punjab, a separate SSA cadre of contractual teachers has been created, for whom different service arrangements have been spelt out and they are posted only in SSA schools. This is an erroneous phenomenon. All schools receiving SSA funding are schools of the state government, and so are all the teachers. SSA is only a programme providing additional funding to the state for elementary education development and reform.""

Dimapur, Sep. 5: Even as the teaching community all over the country are being honoured on the occasion of the 57th Teacher's Day on Wednesday, it was a sad day for 639 teachers serving in 146 government high schools who were recruited under the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) in 2016. The teachers under the aegis of NRMSATA 2016 batch teachers hace been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 against an Office Memorandum (OM) which directed the teachers to accept a reduced pay.

The RMSA 2016 batch teachers have taken their discontentment in the form of agitation in Kohima-which would have coincided with Teacher's Day, if it was not called off by the Nagaland RMSA Teachers' Association (NRMSATA) as a mark of respect to the teachers'.

The NRMSATA 2016 had converged in Kohima on Sept. 4 from across the state for the agitation which was termed as unlawful by the administration.

""The association had sought permission from the district administration but was denied on the directives of the govt. on the claim that they had deposited the pending salary of the RMSA 2016 batch teachers"", said NRMSATA 2016 batch president Sao Venuh.

""However, unless our salaries are credited in our account, we will not accept their justification"", he said.

""Even after our permission for agitation was denied, the association went ahead with the peaceful sit-in putting in our energy on Sept. 4.

We came and voice out what we were supposed to do and made our points clear. The most crucial issue is for revocation of OM and the reason behind our agitation was for the govt. to revoke the OM which directs for deduction of salary"", affirmed Sao.

Venuh, speaking with Eastern Mirror through telephone on the eve of Teacher's Day, said it was unfortunate that the RMSA 2016 batch teachers had to resort to such means as the teachers are helpless and are compelled to do so, to send a message to the authorities, to demand for their rights.

'Respecting the auspicious day and we as teachers decided not to take our agitation on Sept. 5 but have sought permission to continue after Sept. 5 which the association was yet to be granted', communicated Venuh.

""As teachers we want to observe the day with our colleagues, along with the state teaching fraternity and the students' and we are also not contented that we have to miss an auspicious day.

But it was a crucial time for the teachers at this juncture to demand our rights"", lamented Venuh.

""It was the first time, since our appointment, that we are missing Teacher's Day. Although it does not make us happy, we have become an object of uncertainty with an uncertainty employment"", Venuh asserted.","No Teachers' Day for 639 RMSA teachers","940003002","2018-09-05","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/no-teachers-day-for-639-rmsa-teachers/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE
"4614","","Dimapur, Sep. 3 (EMN): The Nagaland RMSA Teachers Association-2016 has said in a statement that the government isn't paying heed to their cries despite its agitation against the office memorandum (OM) to either accept a reduced pay scale within a month or face termination.

The RMSATA-2016 has been boycotting classes since Aug. 27 after the government announced that the monthly salary of the teachers would be reduced by INR 6315.

""Why we can say with conviction that the OM is by nature irrational, invalid and discriminatory is because of the actual guidelines and official documents from the MHRD where this OM has its basis,"" the press release stated.

The association pointed out that in the original draft document of the new scheme stated that ""henceforth there will not be any separate SSA and RMSA teachers; salary as per the new scheme will thus be based only on the different sections of the school they teach viz. primary teachers-Rs 15,000, Upper Primary Teachers- Rs 20,000 and Secondary Teachers-Rs 25,000. We the RMSA 2016 Teachers fall under the category of secondary teachers with an amount of Rs 25,000.""

According to the statement given in the document, it said that all the SSA teachers who are predominantly engaged in teaching the primary and upper primary sections will be receiving only INR 15,000 and INR 20,000. However, it stated that the OM was not served to them.

""The memorandum of the dept. itself is also self contradictory as it states that they are following the guidelines of the new scheme fixing the salary of the RMSA at Rs 25,000, very ironically this OM is served only to some 2016 appointed RMSA Teachers, the other teachers of RMSA appointed in the year 2013 and on May 2016 are exempted from this OM."" it alleged

The association also pointed out the Project Approval Board minutes of the SSA, MHRD which stated; ""State should meet the balance amount from its own resources including the additional funds devolved under the 14th Finance Commission. As per Section 7(5) of the RTE Act, 2009, the State Government shall after taking into consideration the sum, provided by the Central Government and mandatory matching State share, provide the balance funds necessary to fulfill the estimate for the implementation of the Act.""

It asserted that when the state can meet the additional funds (funds apart from central and state matching share) of SSA and other RMSA teachers, it can in no way take the excuse of fund constrains of the state and discriminate a certain section of its employees who fall under the same scheme.

The Nagaland Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan Teachers' Association (NSSATA) of the 2010 and 2013 batches had claimed that the NSSATA (2010 and 2013 batches) were appointed as regular employees according to the nature of appointment.

A press statement appended by the president, Penthungo Y Yanthan, and general secretary, Vinoka Sohe of the NSSATA on Monday, stated that according to their appointment orders, the teachers were endowed with a pay scale and other allowances prescribed by the government of Nagaland from time to time with effect from the date of joining.

The association mentioned the RTI reply to Ponchulo Wanth; ""post creation as being a government of Nagaland undertaking and not of the SSA. ""Hence teachers are appointed on a regular basis and their service is not co-terminus with SSA project.""

Therefore, the association said unlike other SSA and RMSA contractual and adhoc-fixed teachers, the SSA teachers of 2010 and 2013 batch, along with the RMSA 2013 batch are regular employees as per the advertisement and the nature of appointment.

The RMSA 2013 has also clarified the nature of RMSA teachers' appointment and as to why the 2013 batch along with SSA 2010 and 2013 batch were not brought under the purview of the OM.

It stated that they were appointed as regular employees by the government of Nagaland under the Directorate of School Education. It claimed that they enjoy a pay band with all other allowances and rates prescribed by the state government from time to time with effect from the date of joining and deduction towards NPS and GIS which is clearly written in our appointment order issued by the Directorate of School Education and not by the RMSA Mission.

Therefore, the association said that the office memorandum is not applicable to RMSA 2013 and SSA 2010 and 2013 batch.","RMSA, SSA clarify appointment order","938391245","2018-09-03","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/rmsa-ssa-clarify-appointment-order/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE

"4616","","Kohima, Aug. 29 (EMN): The agitation of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan's (RMSA) batch-2016 teachers has entered its third day. The teachers are boycotting class protesting pending salary; they have not been paid for four months i.e., April-July, it was informed. The teachers are demanding redress for government regulations that are said to have been stipulated in an office memorandum issued by the government that the RMSA's subject teachers' salary would be a fixed pay of INR 25,000 per month from 2018-19.

The RMSA teachers started their agitation on August 27, boycotting classes in their demand to the government to release pending salary, and that they won't be accepting the new 'guidelines' issued by the government.

An office memorandum dated Aug. 17 2018 stated to be a ""notice to contractual subject teacher engaged by state mission office, RMSA Nagaland"" read that the ministry of Human Resource Development had integrated the erstwhile Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan into a single entity named the ""Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan"" from 2018-19 onward.

As a policy from the merger, it stated that the government of India had issued guidelines fixing the salary payable to RMSA subject teachers at INR 25,000 per month from 2018-19.

In this regard, the RMSA teachers were directed to submit their acceptance of the new salary scale prescribed by the Central government within a month's period from the notice being issued.

The memorandum was issued through Principal Secretary Menukhol John. It stated: ""This OM is issued in pursuance of the clause given for condition of salary as indicated in the engagement order along with the termination clause.""

The RMSA batch's President Sao Venuh talked to Eastern Mirror. Besides the 'non-release' of the salary, Venuh said, a new development had cropped up in regard to the OM that was served to the RMSA teachers. Despite its request to the department, the state had issued the notice seeking submission of the teachers' acceptance 'through signing of a bond' of the new salary prescribed by the Centre within a month's period from the date the notice was issued, Venuh said.

Terming the memorandum a ""severe and serious issue"" for the teachers, Venuh said that the ""OM has threatened the teachers to the extent of termination of our services."" In such a juncture, he said, they had no option but to go for agitations.

Asserting that the teachers shall not back off from the demand, Venuh maintained that they would rather intensify the agitation and challenge the government 'if they really care for the students' and its employees. He added that there had been no response from the government as yet in spite of the classes being boycotted for three days.

The teachers will intensify their agitation from next week in the form of a 'silent protest,' the updates said.","RMSA teachers to intensify agitation","934948812","2018-08-29","http://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/rmsa-teachers-to-intensify-agitation/","Eastern Mirror",FALSE
"4617","","The association asked all its members to strictly adhere to its directive. In a release issued by association president Sao Venuh and general secretary Haisoliabe Ndang, the association alleged that the State Government has been intimidating RMSA teachers of the 2016 batch.

According to the association, the office memorandum stated that reduction of salaries was a directive given by the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to merge Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and RMSA into the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (SMSA) - an integrated scheme of school education.

The association pointed out that the SMSA draft document clearly states that the Central share under the scheme would be restricted as per the prevalent fund sharing pattern for primary teachers drawing salaries up to Rs 15,000 per month, upper primary teachers up to Rs 20,000 per month and secondary teachers up to Rs 25,000 per month. It said the draft document also states that the salary structure would be determined by the State norms for salaries.

Therefore, the association stated, the fixation of Rs 25,000 per month for secondary teachers did not indicate the actual salary, but simply the fund sharing pattern.

The association also claimed that as per the project approval board meeting minutes for Nagaland, a sum of Rs 10171.12 lakh was estimated for salaries of teachers according to the norms of the scheme and the balance amount was to be met by the State out of its own resources.

On recruitment of teachers, the draft document laid down that teachers would be recruited as per the terms and conditions of the States and Union territories.

As such, the association questioned what are the actual terms and conditions of Nagaland for recruitment and why there are different categories of teachers based on the nature of appointment when everyone has gone through the same mode of recruitment through a written examination and viva voce.

Based on this, the RMSA teachers have demanded equal treatment of all teachers under the new Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan and demanded that the Government should issue new appointment letters to all teachers irrespective of erstwhile schemes with the same terms and conditions.","Nagaland RMSA teachers to boycott classes from tomorrow","932042138","2018-08-25","http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=aug2618%2Foth059","Assam Tribune",FALSE

"4624","","Under the Right to Education Act, certain private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes for the more disadvantaged children.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools.""","Maharashtra Government Finds A New Way To Avoid Paying RTE Reimbursement For Poor Children","1029889288","2018-12-31","https://swarajyamag.com/politics/maharashtra-government-finds-a-new-way-to-avoid-paying-rte-reimbursement-for-poor-children","swarajyamag.com",FALSE
"4625","","BENGALURU: Over 3,000 schools seeking reimbursement under the Right to Education (RTE) Act are upset as they haven't been able to complete the online process to update the authorities about their expenditure. Reason: the column to register their expenses under the 'others' head is missing from the form.

The category existed in previous years. However, the department of public instruction (DPI) says it's not necessary and provides ample room for misuse.

December 10 was the last date for furnishing the relevant information online. But the schools couldn't meet the deadline and on Thursday, they were given another 10 days to comply.

The online form includes various heads under which schools can quantify their expenditure. Teachers' salary, transport and dearness allowance, salary of other staff, contingency, rent, building maintenance, consumables for lab, electricity and water are the heads provided this year. Schools say under the 'others' category, they used to include building tax, CCTV maintenance, fire safety, transportation, meals and internet charges, but the column has been removed.

DPI commissioner PC Jaffer said, ""The software can't validate what's written in the 'others' column. We have studied some audit reports and included all possible items in the software.

"4627","","CHANDIGARH: After much delay, when the family-income certificates are being made finally for the poor man's quota of school seats, parents have now been asked to face the language hurdle. The income-declaration form has been made available only in English.

The parents of children competing for reserved seats under the Right to Education (RTE) Act had struggled to fill even the registration form for different private schools, as those too were in English. Parents allege that it has been done to discourage poor families who want good education for their children. ""Not just the forms, even the guidelines and admission notice were printed in English. They don't want our children to even qualify,"" said a disgruntled parent from the slum colony of Bapu Dham.

Some of the parents even had to ask the document-centre people to fill their form for a price. They others asked their employers to help them. Some of the parents were pleading with people at e-Sampark centres to interpret the form for them. ""I asked a Sampark-centre employee to tell me what was written in the form, but he said he was too busy to help. So I requested the customers who had come to deposit their utility bills to translate the form so that I could know what documents to arrange for my child's admission,"" said Shashi Pal, who had come to the e-Sampark centre of Sector 10.

Chandigarh parents Association president Nitin Goyal said: ""Most of the families from the EWS (economically weaker section) category have poor literacy level, with hardly any proficiency in English. The EWS applicants don't know what to do with the form, as they cannot read English. The administration should provide them with forms in Hindi and Punjabi versions, too.""

RTE consultant Chanchal Singh of the Chandigarh Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, who is also former deputy director of school education, said: ""The forms for admission and income declaration should be in both Hindi and English, so that these are easier for people to interpret. Otherwise, it will be a disadvantage to parents from poor class. The information mismatch might lead to cancellation of the form, even if the case is genuine.

Right To Education (RTE) helpline was launched recently by the Social Welfare Department of Karnataka, which allows one to lodge complaints and get information on the Act. The Executive Director of the Child Rights Trust, Vasudeva Sharma, spoke to RadioActive about how the helpline could be used effectively.

Vasudeva Sharma explained that the RTE Act had been introduced way back in 2009 in Karnataka, and a lot of calls used to be received by the Child Rights Trust members on their personal numbers seeking clarifications. Even though there were no instructions available regarding RTE at that time, they used to clarify or give information in a comprehensible way. Of late, the calls had been about more specific and less common information.

He said they had attempted to set up a hotline back then, which failed because their personal numbers were still popular. The new helpline would have to have employees well-versed in the intricacies of RTE - the national Act as well as the rules for Karnataka and section (12)(1)(C), because (12)(1)(C) was often misused.

He spoke about the dangers of (12)(1)(C) being misused and despite it having popular aspects like forbidding corporal punishment, or stating the kinds of facilities an institution must have, how that could cause people to lose trust in it. It gave the impression that (12)(1)(C) was introduced as an attempt to control private institutions, as the condition laid down for availing this provision spoke only of what was expected of the institutions without placing any responsibility on the government. With the rampant misuse of this section, private institutions became richer but could not be brought under the control - and that such situations would lead to mistrust in the RTE Act itself.

Vasudeva Sharma said that he used to find a lot of children in government schools, but of late the number had been dwindling because they had moved to private schools. However, over time, parents were faced with demands for multiple additional payments. This at times forced the children back into government schools, and other times, they continued education there despite the heavy expenditure.

He also proposed some solutions:

On the move to make 8th standard the equivalent of 10th standard, Vasudeva Sharma said that though there had been discussions, the Central Government was yet to make a decision. He opined that it could not be taken without thorough discussions and analysis but was apprehensive about the imbalance a positive answer would create.

Vasudeva Sharma said that ignorance among activists and officials will deprive the children of the rights extended to them by the government. He suggested that guidelines be prepared wherein the responsibilities of each official is clearly mentioned and that such clarity would enable effective implementation of the Act.

He added that ignorance causes lack of coordination between the concerned departments and organisations, which could lead to failure of the programme.","RTE helpline: How to use it effectively? |","1024431374","2018-12-22","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/rte-helpline-launch-how-do-you-use-it-effectively-30142","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE

"4630","","While assuring the Delhi high court that it would not share the voter identity details of parents and relatives of students of state-run schools with any other agency, the Delhi government on Tuesday said it was collecting the details to implement the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

The city government informed a bench of justice Sanjiv Khanna and justice AJ Bhambani that by collecting the data they can bring back children who have dropped out of school and this was not possible in the absence of a detailed and comprehensive data bank.

""The data so collected will not be shared or retained at the school/zonal/district level for personal or any other use and it will be collected in strict compliance with guidelines,"" the reply read.

The reply came while hearing a plea filed by the Delhi Government School Teachers Association, through advocate Kamlesh Kumar Mishra, challenging the move by the government, seeking the voter ID details of the parents and relatives of students.

On Tuesday, the court was informed that on November 27, a circular was issued by the Directorate of Education (DoE) where it is specifically mentioned that, ""except DoE, no outside agency' has been hired or engaged for data collection or verification"".

""Once it is uploaded on the DoE website, no one can see or use (the data) without permission of competent authority,"" the reply read.

The court was also told that it is absolutely impossible to plan and allocate budget for suitable infrastructure and facilities for children in the absence of comprehensive data.

Earlier, the Delhi government had removed Aadhaar card from the list of the documents sought from children after the Supreme Court had delivered its verdict. The high court had also rapped the state government for collecting the phone numbers and voter ID details of relatives and parents. The matter would be now heard on February 25, 2019.","Voter details of students' kin collected for RTE: Delhi government tells HC","1022079822","2018-12-19","https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/voter-details-of-students-kin-collected-for-rte-delhi-government-tells-hc/story-RZ95aSpZIfnfZFNBrPD3BK.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"4632","","Move aimed at victimising children from the marginalised communities, they allege

Members of the southern unit of Right to Education (RTE) Forum have urged the government to withdraw the Bill tabled in Parliament seeking amendment to Section 16 of the RTE Act which aims at bringing back the detention policy in school education system.

In a resolution unanimously adopted at the first southern regional consultation on RTE, organised by the National RTE Forum and facilitated by Save the Children in Vijayawada, they alleged that it was an attempt to dilute the most progressive section of the Act through 'backdoor' methods. ""This is an ill-conceived move aimed at victimising children from the marginalised communities such as Dalits, adivasis, the urban poor, persons with disabilities and other disadvantaged sections. We strongly demand that the government drop this Bill and create an enabling condition in the classroom,"" said Ambarish Rai, convener, National RTE Forum.

The resolution demanded that the Centre allocate 6 % of the GDP and the State Governments 25 % of their respective budgets to ensure care, protection and equal right to quality education for all children.

The members said they would urge political parties to include 'right to equitable quality education for all children' in their political agenda in the 2019 elections.

Constitution of School Management Committees/School Development and Monitoring Committees in all schools to ensure effective implementation of the RtE Act, establishment of government-funded neighbourhood schools and ultimately move towards Common School System and to strengthen grievance redressal mechanism were among the other demands.

The resolution also called for effective measures to make all schools RTE-compliant, steps to stop closure of government schools in the name of rationalisation, put an end to privatisation and commercialisation of education, imparting adequate training on teachers to make the classroom space more interesting, timely supply of textbooks, uniforms and other learning equipment to students and improvement of infrastructure facilities in schools.

Lakshmi works as a domestic help with a few families in Bengaluru. Her daughter during the academic year 2018-2019 had been admitted to LKG in a private school through the Right to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act 2009, section 12(1)(c). The Act promises 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools for weaker sections and disadvantaged groups.

Lakshmi chose to avail this choice as she felt that in government schools, children are left to themselves and aren't provided adequate attention. She says that she wants to educate her daughter, and felt private school was the best option.

There are several other parents from marginalised groups who would like to avail free education in private unaided schools, during the academic year 2019-2020. But that might not be a possibility if proposed amendments to the RTE rules, for which the cabinet has given the nod, come through. The proposed amendment gives government schools the priority, and the choice of availing admission in a private unaided school will be applicable only if there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. The Minister for Law and Parliamentary affairs Krishna Byregowda in his brief to the media said that preference to private schools has resulted in the government schools having fewer enrollments.

""If parents want to send their children to government schools, they will. Why is the government forcing this upon parents ?"" asks B N Yogananda (General Secretary, RTE Students and Parents Association). He says the private school lobby who don't want children from disadvantaged communities to study in their schools, are pushing for this. While there has been the mention of following the Kerala model with these proposed amendments, Yoganand says that the governments schools in Karnataka aren't at the same level compared to Kerala, and parents in Karnataka aren't willing to send their children to government schools.

In terms of next steps, the association plans to meet the Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education) and demand that the proposed amendments be withdrawn. If not they plan on staging wide protests, and as a last resort would file a petition in the court.

G Nagasimha Rao ( Director, Child Rights Trust ) and convener of the RTE Task Force highlighted the lack of consultations in the process od changing rules. He says that after the RTE rules have not been reviewed even once after being notified in 2012, and amendments were directly called for. The RTE Task Force in their letter to the Principal Secretary, demands that the plan for the proposed amendments be halted; and recommends consulting civil society organisations working in the field of education, concerned parents and children while formulating recommendation to amend RTE rules. The RTE task force too plans on holding protests if the governments goes ahead with the proposed amendments.

This is not the first time that there have been proposals to amend the RTE rules in Karnataka. In January 2018 similar amendment to the rules were proposed by the Education Department but were rejected after coming under severe opposition.

What the government is proposing isn't something outside the law, says Niranjan Aradhya (Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU). He says that section 3 of the RTE Act provides fundamental right to free and compulsory education in the neighborhood school, and there is nothing wrong if the state decides to admit children in a government school available in the neighbourhood.

He adds that other options - aided and unaided schools come in when there are no government schools in the neighbourhood. As a member of the committee by Karnataka Development Authority working to strengthen government schools, Niranjan opines that section 3 of the act must be implemented in letter and spirit and several concrete steps are to be taken in order to strengthen state government schools so that they are on par with central government schools.

The average RTE reimbursement for a child stood at Rs 6871 during the year 2017, compared to the maximum ceiling of Rs 11,848 (cost per child in government schools). This indicates that a large section of the private unaided schools charge a low fee, and come under the low fee paying category schools (LFP). While there are several private schools that provide quality education, the same can't be said about LFPs. Research has pointed to how they even fall short in providing English education, which is one of the reasons parents from marginalised groups are attracted to them in the first place. ""LFP schools can't be thought of as an alternative to government schools "" says Rishikesh Shanker, Associate Professor, Azim Premji University, who advocates for the strengthening of the public education system.

Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh had previously attempted to modify the RTE rules along the same lines that the Education Department of Karnataka has proposed. In a notification by the Department of Elementary Education (Government of Himachal Pradesh) dated June 6th, 2015, guidelines were provided for admission and reimbursement of children under section 12 of the RTE Act.

Under these guidelines the government schools and private unaided schools in the neighborhood would initiate the process of 25 percent reservation in private unaided schools only if the minimum number of students (25) have been filled in the entry standard of the government school. This notification was challenged in the High court in Smt Namikta vs State of HP and others. The grievance of the petitioner was that the notification is contrary to the provisions of section 12(1)(c) of RTE Act which doesn't contain any inhibition and therefore restricts the scope of the Act.

The High Court struck down the notification stating that the notification creates a hierarchy in availing the benefits under section 12(1)(c), and is being read in a contrary manner where importing"" an obligation to admit students from the weaker section and disadvantaged groups only where seats are not available in the state run schools and aided institutions would be to defeat the object of the provisions."" The court concluded that there is no hierarchy in the parent Act and therefore the state government is in violation of the provision of the Act.

A petition regarding similar concerns was raised in the Allahabad High Court in Ajay Kumar Patel vs State of UP where the court stated that a policy of hierarchy can't be laid down by the government as it is contrary to the Parliamentary Act.

While the proposed amendment in RTE act is not supported by parents, the idea of prioritising the government schools may not be bad, after all. The parents and several civil society organisations opposing the amendment think that the condition of government schools in Karnataka is abysmal, including the poor learning levels of students. However, available research shows that there is no difference in learning levels between both groups of students.

A study by Azim Premji Foundation between 2008 and 2013 conducted in Andhra Pradesh examines the difference in learning levels of students (randomly selected from government schools) who were provided a scholarship and attended private schools, and students who didn't receive the scholarship and continued attending government schools.

The private schools who were part of the study had to admit a maximum of 25 percent students from disadvantaged groups, in line with the current 25 percent quota under the RTE. The students were tested at the end of every year for five years on their learning outcomes in Telugu, Mathematics, English and EVS.

The results showed that there was no difference between the learning levels of the different groups of students, and that private schools didn't add any value to the learning levels of the students from disadvantaged groups who had hitherto been in government schools and had joined them. The author of the paper notes that worldwide research is divided on student achievements after obtaining choice to study in private schools, and currently there is no consensus on this matter.","Parents, activists and academia divided while State Cabinet intends to modify RTE Act |","1015789453","2018-12-11","http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/right-to-education-act-amendment-problems-issues-positives-bangalore-karnataka-29209","bengaluru.citizenmatters.in",FALSE

"4635","","PATNA: District magistrate Kumar Ravi will hold a meeting with the private school principals this month to review the safety and security arrangements and Right to Education (RTE) norms being followed by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for India School Certificate Examination (CISCE) affiliated schools in Patna district.

Ravi told this newspaper that the private schools would be informed about the meeting in a couple of days. ""The meeting will be a reminder for schools to ensure safety and security measures, including speed governors in buses, CCTV cameras on school premises, preparations to tackle natural as well as man-made disasters among other facilities,"" he said and added that a number of schools were still careless about the safety of kids. Strict action would be taken against them, he said.

More than 100 city schools and various schools' associations, district programme officer and education officials are likely to attend the meeting.

""It will be an important agenda of the meeting. All private schools have to admit 25% children from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups from their neighbourhoods for free education under the RTE Act,"" Ravi said and added: ""There are 600- and-odd private schools in Patna district registered under RTE and they are bound to follow the admission norms.

"4637","","Many support groups have decided to challenge government's decision legally

The State Cabinet's nod to amend the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota rules has come as a blow to families from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

Many parents have decided to protest the Cabinet's decision which stated that children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities can get admission in private schools under the RTE quota only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

A majority of neighbourhoods already have a government school. In other words, the probability of getting children admitted into private schools is almost nil.

The Department of Primary and Secondary Education is planning to amend three clauses under the Karnataka Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Rules, 2012.

However, experts point out that amending the State rules alone is not adequate as the RTE Act mandates that 25% of the seats in private schools are reserved from children from weaker sections and disadvantaged communities.

The Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which is supposed to be the monitoring body for all aspects concerning the RTE Act, was reportedly not consulted.

Shruthi R., who is hoping her son gets a seat under the RTE quota in a private school for 2019-2020, said: ""I live in the Kamakshipalya ward and there is a government school in the ward. But I do not want to send my child there. The government is denying our right to free English-medium education.""

Many parent support groups have decided to challenge this move legally. B.N. Yogananda, general secretary of RTE Students and Parents' Association, said that they had written to the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights asking of legal possibilities to challenge this move.

""The State government is doing this to appease the private management lobby. This is against the interest of lakhs of parents and children,"" he said.

Nagasimha G. Rao, convener of the RTE task force, said that the State government had taken up a drastic step without consulting different stakeholders.

""The government is saying they will follow the Kerala model, but the quality of education imparted in government schools here cannot be compared to that of Kerala's,"" he said.

For admissions under the RTE quota, a 'neighbourhood' is considered as a revenue village in rural areas, a ward within city corporation limits, and the entire jurisdiction for urban local bodies.","Parents, NGOs cry foul over amendment to RTE Act","1012298235","2018-12-06","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/parents-ngos-cry-foul-over-amendment-to-rte-act/article25683090.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

Now, children seeking admission in private schools under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act quota will get the seat only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood. The State Cabinet on Wednesday granted permission to amend certain rules related to admission procedures under the RTE Act which will now give priority to government schools over the private ones in admissions.

The RTE Act provides for reservation of 25% of seats for students of weaker sections and disadvantaged communities in private schools. But the State Cabinet on Tuesday decided to amend the rules to add a rider that such children would get admission under the RTE Act in private schools only if there are no government schools in their neighbourhood.

Briefing reporters after the Cabinet meeting, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Krishna Byre Gowda said the preference being given to private schools under the RTE Act had resulted in fewer enrolments in government schools.

Stressing the need for giving importance to government schools, he said the original spirit of the Act was to provide admission in private schools in areas where there were no government schools.

The government would notify private schools for admission under the Act in the areas where there are no government schools, he said.","Nod for amending RTE admission rules","1011431526","2018-12-05","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/nod-for-amending-rte-admission-rules/article25675068.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

""Don't expect miracles"" in a huge country like India, the Supreme Court said Friday, refusing to further hear a PIL seeking implementation of the Right to Education Act to bring 35 million poor kids into the formal schooling system.

The apex court had earlier asked petitioner 'Akhil Delhi Prathmik Shikshak Sangh', a registered society, to give a representation to the Centre on implementation of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, also known as RTE.

Refusing to monitor the RTE implementation in the country, a bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said, ""Don't expect miracles. India is a huge, huge country. Priorities are many and certainly, education is one of the priorities.""

The bench, also comprising Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph, took note of the fact that the Centre has given the response after taking note of the representation.

""Heard counsel for the petitioner and perused the relevant material. We are not inclined to interfere. The writ petition is accordingly dismissed,"" it noted in the order.

It had earlier asked senior lawyer Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the organisation, to give representation to the Centre and had said that the government would ""assist the court with regard to the implementation"" of the RTE.

The apex court had also asked the Centre to apprise it of decision taken on the issue. However, it today declined further hearing on the PIL.

The teachers' body, in its PIL, had sought implementation of the right to education of children aged between six to 14 years.

The plea had said the children are suffering as government schools are shutting down and around 9.5 lakh posts of teachers are vacant in these schools.

It had referred to reports ""showing systematic and widespread violations of children's right to education across the country, including violations of numerous specific requirements of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

The petition had said that according to data, there were 14,45,807 government and registered private schools imparting elementary education in the country and as on 2015-16, there were approximately 36.8 million children who were not in school.

It had sought a direction to all the states and UTs to identify the children, as mandated under the RTE Act, within six months to ascertain as to how many of them should be brought in the formal schooling system.

The plea had also sought a direction to identify ""all schools whether government, private, aided or unaided"" which did not have proper infrastructure such as ""all-weather building with at least one classroom for every teacher, barrier-free access, separate toilets for boys and girls, teaching staff and teaching learning material (TLM).

It had asked for a direction ""to ensure that unaided private primary recognised schools admit the children of economically weaker section (EWS) category in their first level to the tune of 25 per cent quota as enshrined in the RTE Act"".

"4648","","PUNE: All rounds of admission to fill the 25% quota for students from economically-deprived section of society under the Right To Education (RTE) Act have been completed. As things stand, as many as 51,849 seats are yet to be filled despite the long-drawn process.

Activists have pointed out that lack of awareness among parents belonging to the disadvantaged category, lack of a competent grievance redressal cell, and an arduous process of obtaining eligibility documents are some of the reasons for not achieving the 100% admission target.

Komalbai, who works as a maid in Pashan has two of her children living in the city. ""I don't know anything about RTE. My elder daughter is in class I and my son in KG. When I tried to admit my son to an aided school, but they refused admission. So I have admitted him in a Zilla Parishad school.""

While lack of awareness is one issue, another problem is that the migrant population may not have required documents. ""We have a voter ID and Aadhaar card but we don't have the income certificate. The agent asked for a lot of money for it. Hence, we just left it at that,"" said Komalbai.

Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch said, ""Awareness is the first step. The government needs to conduct massive awareness programmes about the RTE Act in slums and other areas. The polio drive is a success because of the massive awareness campaign. On similar lines, there should be an awareness drive about RTE Act so that everybody knows what needs to be done so that their children can get admission.""

Grievance redressal is another major problem that is hampering even NGOs and other activists working to help disadvantaged students get admission. The education department had announced a grievance redressal department with a helpline number. However, none of it was implemented.

""Currently, just one person talks to people with grievances. When a parent complains, this person would tell them to go to the school. Why would the school entertain the parents? Even letters from the education officer were hardly of any use because there were no follow ups,"" said Mukund Kirdat, an education activist.

A bench consisting of Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Kameshwar Rao took up the matter and has sought responses from the respondents, the civic bodies, the Delhi government's education secretary and the Government Schools Teachers' Association. The next hearing is on 30 January.

The RTE Act on standards and norms for a school mandates the minimum working for teachers to be 45 hours per week, including preparation time that comes to seven-and-a-half hours per day for a working week of six days.

The DoE on 24 January 2014 had in a circular, increased the working time from 6.45 am to 2.15 pm, for noon session and 11.00 am to 6.30 pm for the afternoon session in double-shift schools (summer timings) and 7.15 am to 2.45 pm for single-shift schools.

Stating that the current working hours of teachers in Delhi government and local authority schools are in violation of the provisions of the Right to Education Act, a petition in the Delhi High Court called for extending it to seven-and-a-half hours.

The petitioner, civil society organisation Justice for All, challenged a May 20, 2014, circular by the Directorate of Education (DoE) laying down the working hours of teachers in government and government-aided schools in Delhi at six-and-a-half hours for single-shift schools and six hours for double-shift schools.

A bench of Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice Kameshwar Rao took cognizance of the matter and sought responses from the respondents -- the civic bodies, the Delhi government's education secretary and the Government Schools Teachers' Association. The next hearing is on January 30.

Three days later, a fresh order was issued, keeping the earlier order on hold till the next academic year. It cited representations from teachers stating that infrastructural facilities such as extra staff rooms and furniture needed to be put in place before enforcing the extended working hours.

A fresh order was issued in May 2014, increasing work hours of teachers from six hours to six-and-a-half hours in single-shift schools and from five-and-a-half hours to six hours in double-shift schools.

"4653","","The Right to Education (RTE) Act may be amended to bring special schools under its purview, Anita Julka, Professor in the Department of Education of Group with Special Needs, National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), has said.

She was talking to The Hindu on the sidelines of a workshop on inclusive education at the State Council of Educational Research and Training here recently. Ms. Julka said talks had been held with the Ministry of Social Justice on amending the RTE Act, as special schools had been made a legislative option for students under the Rights of Persons With Disabilities (RPWD) Act, 2016. The RPWD Act, she said, promoted inclusive education and gave a child the option of studying in regular or special schools or have home-based education. Inclusion, she said, did not mean in the physical sense alone. It meant that the education system had to accommodate the requirements of a child rather than child having to fit the system.

Therefore, if a neighbourhood school was not ready to accept a child with high-support needs or its teachers were not equipped enough for that or parents felt that their children needed full-day attention or had many learning gaps, then special schools were an option in the initial years before shifting them to regular schools.

Home-based education should be the last resort, and was preferable only for children with profound disabilities, Ms. Julka said.

Inclusion, in an optimal sense, would mean providing all support in school, but it was difficult in the country. So, if at all a child was attending a special school, it should be only till the child caught up, she said. However, even if special schools were to be treated as resource centres for inclusion, it would not work till they were brought under a single umbrella, she said. Taking parents' choice into consideration was also important.

Attitude changes were possible only if everyone worked together. The earlier differently abled children went to regular school, the more they would be be accepted by other students and teachers.","RTE Act amendment may include special schools","986274888","2018-11-04","https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/rte-act-amendment-may-include-special-schools/article25420706.ece","The Hindu",FALSE

"4658","","MUMBAI: The Brihanmumbai Muncipal Corporation on Friday conducted a fourth round of lottery under the Right to Education (RTE) Act for students from underprivileged backgrounds who have not yet secured admission in schools.

Over 4,700 such children in the city have not yet secured a seat, but Friday's lottery made allotments only to 402 of them. This lottery was the final round of admissions for the current academic year.

BMC conducts online admissions for 25% seats reserved under RTE Act, 2009, at unaided non-minority schools in the city. This year, 347 schools were eligible for the process, and on offer were 8,341 seats. However, through three rounds of admissions, only 3,168 out of the 11,343 applicants secured admission. As many as 3,209 did not report for admission despite being allotted a seat.

Over the past few days, several parents came to BMC's education department with requests for another chance at admissions. ""Since there were vacant seats, we decided to hold another round of admissions for those who had not been allotted a seat in the entire process. But those who have rejected a seat will not get another chance,"" said a BMC official.

In this round, out of the 402 allotments, 352 got a seat in state board schools. The rest of the students will, however, now not get a chance. ""Many students have been left out because of demand-supply mismatch. While there are some schools which have applications exceeding their capacity, some schools have no takers,"" said the civic official.

Parents will have until October 20 to confirm admissions at the respective schools. In case schools do not admit students, parents can approach the local education officials for help.","RTE Round 4: Only 400 of 4,700 Mumbai kids allotted seats - Times of India","962757788","2018-10-06","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/rte-round-4-only-400-of-4700-mumbai-kids-allotted-seats/articleshow/66093377.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4659","","A division bench headed by Justice Akil Kureshi has said that the Gujarat government needs to provide for change and expansion of choices to students applying for admission under the Right to Education Act (RTE).

The order came in connection with a Public Interest Litigation filed by Sandip Munjyasara, who had sought that students who were yet to be admitted under RTE be allowed to make changes in the school of choice mentioned in the original RTE application form.

The petition has also sought that the number of vacant seats in each school be made available to the students so that they can revise their choice.

The court said in its order that the state needs to publicise the number of seats available and the number of students who are yet to get admission after the first round is over. It also said that this details be made available school wise.

The court clarified that the option to modify and expand their choice of schools will not be available to students who had already accepted the schools assigned and those who had been offered their choice of schools but had chosen not to take admission in the same.

The court, however, said that no changes will be made to admissions this year as the process is more or less complete. Thus, the option of modifying their choice of schools will not be available to students who are left out under RTE this year.

The court observed that since it is already the end of September, if students get admission they would end up attending classes from the second session, which would affect their education.

It also directed the government to ensure that widest publicity be given to ensure that parents and students are aware about the form filling exercise.

It said that they should be encouraged to indicate as many choices of school as possible while filling up the form.The court observed that the guardians of students who apply under RTE are often themselves handicapped by poverty and illiteracy and the state needs to be sensitive about it.

It also did not entertain the government's view that permitting changes in choice even after first round was not possible since the entire system was online. The court observed that it would not be impossible to implement. ""It will ensure that more students secure admission under RTE. System must realise that we are dealing with a sensitive issue,"" said the court.","Allow students to modify choice of school under RTE: Gujarat HC","955688325","2018-09-27","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-allow-students-to-modify-choice-of-school-under-rte-gujarat-hc-2668492","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"4660","","NEW DELHI: The demand for free and compulsory education up to Class 12 grew louder as child rights activists, legal experts and members of national and state commissions for child rights came together in the Capital to emphasise the critical role of education system in keeping the children sheltered from agents of human trafficking.

The Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation, in association with Delhi Legal Services Authority (DLSA) and Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) organised a national conference on Combating Trafficking through Education at Constitution Club of India in Delhi.

Priyank Kanoongo, member, National Commission for Protection of Child Rights pointed that children who do not attend school are often the most susceptible to perpetrators of trafficking. ""They often come from poor families who are unable to afford the academic fee. Education can be a source of empowerment steering their future away from the ugliness of trafficking. Free and compulsory education to girls of 15- 18 years of age is the first step towards achieving this reality, "" Kanoongo said.

The National Crime Records Bureau reported that in 2016 alone, 9,034 children were trafficked, a figure that had risen dramatically by 131 per cent from 3,905 in 2015. Given such alarming data, there is an urgent need of a comprehensive approach to combat the organised crime of trafficking.

Geetanjali Goel, special secretary, Delhi Legal Services Authority said, ""There are gaps which need to be identified. When I was at the Juvenile Justice Board I would see many cases of children who had been trafficked from states like Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh for executing thefts. So it is not just trafficking for prostitution or labour. More research into the causes and purpose behind trafficking needs to be done to find specific solutions."" She emphasised on the need to identify and map children who are school drop outs as they are more vulnerable. ""We are working on the module to educate children in schools in Delhi to prevent offences and protect them,"" Goel added.

Bhuwan Ribhu, lawyer and child rights activist stressed on the need to take ownership of the issue to combat trafficking. ""When a child is trafficked every fundamental right of that child is snatched. Let us pledge to make this a public movement so that every child is free, safe and educated,"" he added.","'Extend RTE to class 12 to protect children from human trafficking' - Times of India","955450396","2018-09-26","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.comhome/education/extend-rte-to-class-12-to-protect-children-from-human-trafficking/articleshow/65970855.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

"4662","","The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India has expressed dissatisfaction over the implementation of the Right to Education Act (RTE) in Gujarat pointing out glaring deficiencies ""indicating that the key objectives of the law for universalisation of elementary education could not be fully achieved due to various deficiencies"" in Gujarat.

In a report tabled in the Assembly, the CAG has revealed that 12.80 to 15.11 per cent of children in the age group of 6-14 years were not enrolled in any school in the state during 2012-17. But the state government could only identify between 2.72 to 6.12 per cent of children as ""out of school children"" during the same five years.

These deficiencies, the report said, include failure to provide basic facilities in schools and setting admission targets without taking into consideration the availability of seats as per the RTE quota. ""The state government could not provide basic infrastructure facilities in majority of government schools even after seven years of implementation of the RTE Act,"" the CAG report mentioned. The Government of India and the Gujarat government's share of Rs 3635.57 crore (34 per cent) was short due to under utilisation of funds for implementation of the RTE Act, the report noted.

The CAG also expressed dissatisfaction about the state government's monitoring mechanism to ensure the proper implementation of the Act, also known as the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act of 2009. The CAG noted that the ""monitoring mechanism was weak as Block Resource Centre Coordinators or Cluster Coordinators had not conducted the prescribed number of inspections of schools"".

On RTE Act's clause for establishment of neighbourhood schools and transportation facility, the CAG report stated that the state government mapped schools in 2011-12 and found the requirement of 201 schools to meet the neighbourhood school norm. ""Of these, only 25 schools have been established and made functional as of March 2017. As a result, the number of students identified to be provided transportation facilities due to non-availability of schools in the neighbourhood increased three times from 51,653 in 2012-13 to 1,41,854 students in 2016-17,"" the report stated.

Further, during the audit, it was revealed that several primary and upper primary government schools were functioning without any teacher during 2012-17 as against the minimum requirement, it stated.

On the other hand, in the ""test-checked"" districts, the audit found surplus teachers in 275 primary schools (349 teachers) and 924 upper primary schools (1105 teachers). ""The state government could have utilised these surplus teachers in schools which did not have or which had less number of teachers. Thus, even after a lapse of more than seven years since implementation of the RTE Act the state government failed in ensuring maintenance of pupil- teacher ratio as mandated by the Act,"" the report pointed out.

The report pointed out that the prescribed pupil-teacher ratio in Gujarat was not achieved in 1,156 out of 10,531 primary schools and 3,098 out of 22,234 upper primary schools as on March 2017. As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Further, the audit found that the local authorities had not provided training to 90,789 (27 per cent) of the 3,41,157 out-of-school children during 2012-17. ""Thus the objectives of the Act of increasing the competency level of out of school children for their mainstreaming in appropriate class remained unachieved,"" the report stated.

It also observed that the State Advisory Council met only ""twice"" against 16 meetings to be held during 2013-17.

In its annual compliance report of Gujarat Education Department on implementation of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009, the CAG noted that the targets for admission to economically weaker section and disadvantaged groups under the Right to Education Act have been fixed by the Gujarat government without considering the mandated provision of the Act.

""The process of fixation of a target was erroneous. The target fixed was much less than the mandated 25 per cent of the seats reserved as per RTE Act. As per DISE (District Information System for Education) data (2016-17), there are total 4,26,510 seats available for admission in Class I of unaided schools in Gujarat. However, against 1,06,628 seats (25 per cent of total seats) available for admission to children from economically weaker and disadvantaged groups, the target fixed was only 46,000 (43 per cent). This indicates that the targets have been allotted by the state government without considering the mandated provision of the Act,"" the report stated.

Citing the case of Ahmedabad city, the report stated that the District Education Officer received 17,866 applications as against the target of 18,950 seats during 2013-17. Of these only 13,126 children have been given admission.

Of the remaining 4,740 applications, 2,178 applications were rejected for want of supporting documents, while 2562 children did not join the school due to-allotment of admission is a school other than the one chosen, the schools being far away from residence and allotment in other medium than chosen.

Pertaining to reimbursement of fees (Rs 10,000 or actual fee charged by the school whichever is less) to the private schools against these 25 per cent reserved seats, the report pointed out a delay of six to twelve months by the district authorities.

""In test-checked districts (Ahmedabad and Banaskantha), the district authorities had not reimbursed as of June 2017 fees of Rs 91.28 lakh payable to 377 private schools against 2,121 students admitted under RTE Act during 2014-17. Further, seven talukas -- Dhandhuka in Ahmedabad, Anand in Anand district, Radhanpur, Harij, Santalpur, Saraswati and Shankheshwar in Patan district -- have not even calculated the fee to be reimbursed to 59 schools for 770 students admitted during 2014-17,"" the report stated.

The reason cited by the District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) of these districts for this delay is ""due to late receipt of grant from the Director of Primary Education"".

"4663","","The state government has under utilised funds over Rs 3500 crore funds for implementation of Right to Education Act. This has been revealed in the recent audit report of Comptroller and Auditor General of India for the year ended March 2017. The report screams of deficiencies in the state government and clearly defines the intent towards RTE implementation, contrary to the tall claims made by the education authorities over the years.

While on one hand, the state government, this year kept boasting of making provision for more seats for RTE children, but not getting children for admission, the report clearly states that the admission targets were much lower than the actual seats available.

The report stated, ""The department allotted targets to all districts and Municipal corporations for admission under 25% RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in class 1. The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission. Instances of denial of admission to eligible children and allotment of admission in different schools not opted by the applicants were also noticed.""

As per the pupil-teacher ratio prescribed under the RTE Act, there should be at least two teachers in a primary school and three teachers in upper primary schools.

Commenting on the admission targets, the CAG has observed that the education department allotted targets to the district and municipal corporations for admission under 24 per cent RTE quota without considering the total number of seats available for admission in Class 1.

""The targets allotted were observed to be much lower than the actual seats available for admission in the state"" the report said.

The CAG also came across instances of ""denial of admission to eligible children"" during its scrutiny.

During scrutiny, the CAG found that in Surendranagar district alone, 359 eligible children of ""weaker sections and disadvantaged groups"" were denied admission during 2016-17 by the district authorities ""stating that the reserved seats of the schools opted by the applicants had been filled up"".

"4666","","NEW DELHI: Drawing attention to how considerable academic time was getting lost due to teachers being on repeated election duty, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights has written to the Election Commission reminding the poll watchdog that the Right to Education Act stipulates 220 days and 800 hours of education to a child every year. The commission has recommended that the ECI take into account during the discussion on ""one nation one election"" the need to secure the Right to Education of children.

Quoting research conducted by National Institute of Educational Planning and Administration in 2017, the child rights body pointed out that in 2015-16, 15.14% of the teachers in four states, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha and Uttarakhand, worked as booth level officers as part of election duty.

The commission in its representation to the EC also cited a desk analysis of data and complaints to say that during the period of election duties, midday meal is not served in the schools depriving them of the nutrition and their fundamental right to development. Also schools are converted to polling stations resulting in a loss of 10 days in preparations, security and inspection.

"4667","","A division bench of the Gujarat High Court on Thursday asked the state government to place on record the result of a culmination of the third round of admissions on the next date of hearing. The direction comes following a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed with the court to ensure that maximum underprivileged students get admission in neighbouring schools under the Right to Education Act (RTE). Next hearing has been scheduled for September 19.

The court observed that despite two rounds of admission for allotting eligible students to neighbourhood schools as per the choices indicated by parents, around 33,000 seats under the RTE are yet to be filled. It should be noted that as per the Act 25% quota in schools is to be reserved for admission under RTE.

The court observed that against the vacant seats 41,000 students who had applied for the admission were yet to be granted one.

""The prime reason for this appears to be that while filling the forms, the parents would have indicated limited preference of schools in his or her case and seat in the concerned schools may not be available,"" the court observed in its order.

It should be noted that the petitioner had argued that fresh options should be given to such students to ensure maximum admission is granted under RTE but the state government had cited practical difficulties in adopting such a court. The government had argued that it has already initiated the third round of admission on the basis of current choices.","Place records of 3rd round of admission under RTE: Gujarat HC to state government","946244408","2018-09-14","https://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-place-records-of-3rd-round-of-admission-under-rte-gujarat-hc-to-state-government-2663032","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"4669","","The Progressive School Association (PSA) -- an umbrella organisation of 170 private schools in Uttarakhand -- will knock on the doors of the high court against non-payment of dues under the Right to Education (RTE) Act by next week.

Despite the high court order to clear dues by March 31 this year, the government is yet to pay them. The association is gathering details of students and pending dues from schools to submit before the court.

""We will reach out to the high court for the clearance of pending dues by next week. Running schools has become a liability especially in times when the government has failed to clear the bills. Many schools aren't able to pay salaries to their staff,"" Prem Kashyap, president of the association, said.

Approximately Rs 90 crore is to be paid to over 4,000 private schools in the state under RTE. In Dehradun alone, Rs 50 lakh was distributed in July and August while nearly Rs 7 crore is still pending.

The number of students admitted under RTE in unaided schools rose from 80,000 in 2015-16 to 1.7 lakh in 2016-17. But people close to the matter claim that from the current financial year 2018-19, admissions under RTE were restricted.

Under the RTE Act, Centre gives states 65% of the cost of providing free primary education. For north-eastern states, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand, it is 90%. The state government selects students and allots them private schools, where they are granted free admission. The state government reimburses the schools at a fixed rate.

As per the provisions of the RTE Act, the Centre pays to school a monthly fee not exceeding Rs 1,383 and an annual fee of Rs 2,100 for uniform, meal and textbooks per child. Some schools even charge a nominal fee from such students.

""The central government hasn't paid dues pending before 2015-16 which is a burden on the state exchequer,"" Bhupinder Kaur Aulakh, secretary, school education, said.

As per the data available with the school education department, central government paid Rs 39.80 crore against the total expenditure of Rs 49.55 crore for the academic session 2015-16.

In 2016-17, R 81.89 crore was spent on providing education to children from underprivileged families. The Union government didn't provide funds that year, said officials who did not want to be named.

"4670","","NEW DELHI: A report on child marriage and teenage pregnancies that analyses the data from National Family Health Survey-4 (2015-16) shows a direct co-relation between underage marriages and educational status of girls.

Citing low prevalence rates where girls have completed secondary education, the report by National Commission for Protection of Child Rights and voluntary organisation Young Lives makes a pitch for making secondary level schooling a fundamental right.

Findings show the completion rate of secondary schooling is considerably higher among unmarried girls aged 15-19 years in almost all states. Even National Human Rights Commission secretary general Ambuj Sharma emphasised the need to extend the right to education from Class VIII to the secondary level.

The NHRC is also planning to recommend to the ministry of women and child development a uniform age for marriage for both men and women. In 140 countries, age of marriage is 18 for both men and women. Last month the law commission in a consultative paper on family laws suggested the legal age for marriage for both men and women across religions should be recognised at 18 years, the universal age for majority.

The study based on NFHS-4 data shows that of the 15 to 19 year old girls, who at the time of the survey reported to have been married before the legal age of marriage, 30.8% had never been to a school and 21.09 % had education up to the primary level. The percentage of girls who had secondary education and were married before 18 was 10.2%.

Those with higher levels of education were further down to 2.4%. While overall prevalence of child marriage declined from 26.5% in 2005-06 to 11.9% in 2015-16. Bihar is a case in point. The state recorded a significant decline in child marriages from 47.8% in 2005-06 to 19.7% in 2015-16.

The study also reveals that amongst the married girls aged 15 to 19 years, 31.5% girls were found to be have babies. Almost a quarter of the married girls in the age group of 15 to 16 years had at least one child.","To cut underage marriage, expand RTE, say experts - Times of India","944525437","2018-09-11","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/to-cut-underage-marriage-expand-rte-say-experts/articleshow/65776241.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4671","","The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

Even as a Bill to make child marriage void in India is pending before the cabinet, the National Human Rights Commission's (NHRC) core group on child marriage has, in its report to be submitted to the Ministry of Women and Child Development this week, recommended that the Right to Education must be extended to all students up to the age of 18 years so as to prevent child marriage. The NHRC has based its recommendation on research that shows a strong correlation between a girl child's education level and age of marriage, with better education levels showing lesser likelihood of her being married early.

A report released by the apex child rights body National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) on Tuesday shows that being out of school at 15 years is a strong predictor of early marriage. The finding is based on analysis of National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data (2015-16) for determining prevalence of child marriage among girls in the 15-19 years age group.

NHRC Secretary General Ambuj Sharma, who released the report on Tuesday, said, ""The NHRC had recently formed a core group on child marriage. In our report, we have noted that a necessary step to prevent early marriage is to make education free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 18 years. Accordingly, the Right to Education Act must be amended so that it is applicable up to class 14 instead of class 8 right now.""

The report, 'India child marriage and teenage pregnancy', compiled by NCPCR and the NGO Young Lives India, shows that in almost all states, the completion rate of secondary schooling is significantly higher among unmarried girls in the 15-19 years age group. The report shows that in the 15-19 age group of married girls, 30 per cent have never received any education, 21.9 per cent have got primary education, 10 per cent have secondary schooling while only 2.4 per cent have higher education.

Among states, in Bihar, which has a child marriage prevalence far above the national average, the completion rate of secondary education among girls who married before 18 years is 51 per cent, followed by Delhi and Rajasthan at 54 per cent and 57 per cent, respectively. ""There is a strong correlation between educational attainment of girls and early child marriage. There is also a strong association between parents' low aspirations for child's education and teenage marriage,"" said Renu Singh from Young Lives. The data also showed that 32 per cent of married girls aged 13 to 19 years had their first child when they were still in their teenage. NCPCR Chairperson Stuti Kacker cited the example of Karnataka, which has made child marriage null and void.

The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act 2006 doesn't invalidate child marriage but only gives the contracting parties the option of annulling it within two years of becoming adult or through a guardian in case they are still minors. The WCD ministry's proposal, seeking to make make child marriage 'void ab initio', is pending approval of the Union cabinet for a while now.

"4672","","DUBLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has canceled a planned visit to Ireland during a November trip to Europe, Irish media reported on Tuesday.

The White House in August announced that Trump would travel to Ireland for the first time as president as part of a trip to attend the Nov. 11 commemoration in Paris of the 100th anniversary of the armistice that ended World War One.

The White House, the Irish Foreign Ministry and the office of Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar all declined immediate comment on reports of the cancellation from Irish state broadcaster RTE and the Irish Independent newspaper.

An correspondent for RTE said it understood that no formal communication had yet been made to the Irish government and that a statement from the U.S. State Department or the White House was expected in the coming hours.

A number of groups announced they would stage protests during the Trump visit, in which the president had been expected to visit the capital Dublin and his golf resort in the west coast village of Doonbeg.

Varadkar, who as a cabinet minister opposed extending an invitation to Trump before changing his mind when he became prime minister, described the trip as coming ""a little bit out of the blue"", but said the office of the U.S. president must be respected.","Trump cancels planned November visit to Ireland: RTE TV","944299056","2018-09-11","https://www.investing.com/news/world-news/trump-cancels-planned-november-visit-to-ireland-rte-tv-1605929","investing.com",FALSE

Can the RTE achieve its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all'?

How does one describe a hair oil, which is designed to help hair grow, but after actual use causes the remaining hair to fall? Or, how does one describe a potency drug, which is prescribed to cure impotency but which, when used, makes someone permanently impotent?

There is no single word or phrase, at present, in the English language that can accurately describe such a behaviour or effect - wherein, the result yielded is the exact opposite of the one intended. But thanks to RTE (Right to Education Act), which is having a similar effect of destroying education instead of improving it, we might soon be able to describe all such contrarian effects with a simple phrase - ""doing an RTE!"" For instance, it may be fair to say that ""the hair oil did an RTE on its user"" to indicate that the hair oil caused hair fall instead of hair growth or that the ""potency drug did an RTE on the patient"", to indicate that the potency drug increased impotency instead of curing it.

The present write up, seeks to capture the some of the dangerous implications of RTE and thereby justify the usage of the phrase ""doing an RTE!""

The RTE Act was passed by Parliament in 2009 with the 'intended' objective of providing 'free and compulsory education to all' children between the age of six and 14. Let us evaluate how 'successful' RTE has been in achieving exactly the opposite. Let's look at its impact on a few of the critical parameters:

1. Has RTE Succeeded In Providing ""Free Education For All?""

The answer is a big no.

RTE has neither provided nor will it ever be able to provide ""free education for all"" because it is just not designed to do so. In fact, ""free education for all"", seems more like a homily thrown in to silence any likely opposition, than like a statement of serious intent. Look at the table below:

- At the time of enactment of RTE in 2009-10, around 5.73 crore children were studying in private schools but they were all left in the lurch, with RTE having nothing positive to offer them.

- A huge 13 crore plus children were studying in government schools but surprisingly, RTE offers nothing positive for them too.

So, if RTE totally ignores all the 19 crore (approximately) school-going children, who on earth does it seek to benefit?

- RTE seeks to benefit only a tiny fraction of these 19 crore students, based not on any 'economic' criteria, as is made out to be, but on the criteria of sheer luck (lottery conducted to give RTE admissions) or rampant corruption (rigging of RTE lottery).

- This tiny fraction of students, who are said to be benefitting from RTE is as tiny as 0.31 per cent or just 6.71 lakh students (for the year 2013-14). Sadly, even this number is found to be highly over estimated in several studies.

Another critical question to be asked is - what if most of the beneficiaries, who are now said to be getting the benefit of free education under RTE, would already have been getting the same benefit in government schools under the non-RTE regime?

2. Has RTE Improved The Condition Of The Nearly 12 Crore Students Studying In Government Schools?

The answer again is a resounding no.

- RTE gives the government a great excuse to not do anything significant for the government schools and dangle the carrot of RTE to anyone who complains.

- The government schools will never ever improve and will only continue to further deteriorate as the entire game plan of RTE, seems to be, to systematically destroy the government schools by sequentially pushing more and more students from government schools to private schools.

- Telangana Chief Minister Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao has in fact cited the same reason, on the floor of the state assembly, for not implementing RTE in the state. He termed RTE as a ""durmargamaina chattam"" (a draconian act).

3. If The Government Wants To Shift More And More Children To Private Schools, Has It Enabled A Rapid Expansion Of Private Education Capacity?

The answer, yet again, is no.

Look at the table below, clearly showing the decreasing trend in the number of schools:

- There is hardly any addition to the number of schools in the country. The number of schools, in fact, decreased in 2014 and 15 and increased by only 0.1 per cent in 2015 and 16

- While the number of government schools, as expected, continued to decrease, the rate of growth in private schools also registered a rapid decline from highs of 13.1 per cent in 2011 and 12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015 and 16.

Let's look at it realistically - who in the right frame of his/her mind, would want to open a shop (read school) where 25 per cent of the goods (25 per cent seats reserved under RTE) have to be sold at a huge loss - that too in a market where this rule applies only to his/her shop (Hindu-run schools) and not to the shops of others (minority schools)?

4. Has RTE Succeeded In Educating More Children By Bringing More Of Them To Schools?

The answer, once again, is no.

This is the stark reality of RTE - it seems to have 'successfully' managed to reduce the number of school-going children. Look at the trend of enrollment in Classes I to V.

- The number of students in Classes I to V reduced from 13.52 crore in year 2010-11 to 12.91 crore in year 2015-16.

- The number of students in government schools reduced rapidly from 9.41 crore in 2010-11 to 7.81 crore in 2015-16.

- The rate of growth in enrollment in private schools also declined from a high of 9.5 per cent in 2011-12 to just around 1.2 per cent in 2015-16.

The population of India, for sure, has not declined. What then could have led to the reduction in the number of school-going children?

5. Has The Condition Of More Than 7 Crore Children Studying In Private Schools, Improved?

The simple answer is that - it has never been worse!

Ironically, while these 7 crore plus students are totally excluded from benefits of RTE, they are covertly included while sharing the costs of RTE.

- People have been falsely led to believe, by the government and by most prominent RTE activists, that the government reimburses, to the schools, the full amount of fees for the 25 per cent seats allotted under RTE.

- The fact is that the government reimburses only a fraction of this fees and not the full fee charged by the schools. Look at the amounts reimbursed in some states and compare them with the fees charged by private schools in these states:

- The amount of reimbursement varies from a low of Rs 5,400 in UP to a high of Rs 18,311 in Uttarakhand. Sadly, even these amounts are rarely paid on time and some never paid at all.

- Who is to foot the bill for the difference between the amount paid by the government and the actual fee charged by the schools? Who, for instance, is to pay the deficit of Rs 90,000 per RTE seat in a school, that may be charging 1 lakh as its fees but would be getting only Rs 10,000 per seat as the reimbursement?

- This deficit, unfortunately, is being paid by common folks - the worthless ""unreserved"" category - making their children study in private schools.

Hope that the deceit, sham and irony of it all sinks into the peoples' minds - that the government, vide RTE, has fixed, for itself, an MRP (maximum retail price) on school fees when it 'buys' education from the private schools but refuses to similarly fix any MRP for private citizens when they buy the same education from the same set of schools.

It is, perhaps, the only one-of-its-kind case in the entire world where - the citizens subsidise the government instead of the government subsidising the citizens! (Read this article for a more detailed discussion)

6. Has RTE Succeeded, At The Very Least, In Improving The Overall Quality Of Education?

The answer to this too, unfortunately, is no.

Look at the trend of learning outcomes given in the ASER - Annual Survey of Education Report 2016:

- The number of students in Class V who can read a Class 2 level text was already at an abysmal 50.7 per cent in 2010. However, with RTE, instead of improving, it fell further down to 41.6 per cent in 2016.

- Similarly, the number of students in Class VIII who could read a Class II level text fell from 83.5 per cent in 2010 to 73.1 per cent in 2016.

Look at the data on the level of math that the students can do:

Just like in basic reading, a drastic drop can also be seen in the number of students who can do basic division - all thanks to this great panacea for all education ills of India - RTE!

Thus, the summary of this remarkable legislation called RTE, is that:

1. It will never ever succeed in achieving its stated goal of providing 'free and compulsory education for all' because it is just not designed to do so.

2. It completely neglects the nearly 10 crore students studying in government schools and provides the government a great excuse to not do anything much for them.

3. It seeks to push the government school students to private schools but does nothing to increase the private school capacity. On the contrary, RTE does everything to constrict the growth of private schools - leading to a reduction not only in the number of schools but also in the number of school-going students.

4. It seeks to give the benefit of 'free education' to around five to 10 lakh students (most of whom might already have been getting free education in government schools) by making nearly 19 crore other students suffer.

5. Even these five to 10 lakh students don't really benefit because of the drastic drop in the quality of learning and education of all students.

6. It has, additionally, made education so unaffordable for more than 8 crore students studying in private schools that the school fee has now become a top means of birth control and is even leading to suicides of parents and students. (Read for more details)

With 'achievements' as great as the ones listed above, what other than destroying India and its education, can we say, is the objective of RTE?

One can only hope and pray that all the learned souls of India - in the media, in the think-tanks and in the government - see through this charade of RTE and immediately stop RTE from ""doing an RTE"" on India.","Let's Stop The RTE From 'Doing An RTE' On India","940284707","2018-09-06","https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/lets-stop-the-rte-from-doing-an-rte-on-india","swarajyamag.com",FALSE
"4674","","The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday issued notice to the state government over a petition about vacant seats under the Right to Education Act. The petition filed by Sandeep Munjyasara has sought the court's directive to conduct subsequent rounds of admission to fill up vacant seats by allowing children to modify their choices.

The petitioner has asked the court to order a third round of the admission process and allow applicants to modify their choice of schools in such a way that children should be able to add and delete the schools as well as set priority with the knowledge about vacant seats in particular school. The petitioner further suggested that enough attempts should be made to fill up all vacant seats under the RTE Act.

The petition said: ""After nearly two-and-a-half months of delay, the second round of admission was done without any application of mind.

"4675","","Even as half the syllabus in schools have been completed and students are gearing up for their first term examinations, the state government is still mulling over the 4th round of admissions under the Right to Education Act. With nearly 40,000 seats remaining vacant after three rounds, the government claims that only 11,000 students are yet to get admitted.

Giving 'preferred schools not available' as the reason for the discrepancy in numbers, state government officials said, ""Even if there are vacancies, parents want only 'certain schools', which is why 11,000 children are yet to get admitted. If need be, we will be conducting another round of admissions to accommodate them,"" said an official from the Education Department.

The state government this year had surprised everyone when they nearly doubled the total number of seats under RTE to 1,12,000. In the first round, nearly 80,000 students were allotted seats out of which 71,000 took admission. The second round was delayed for a few months and was held after getting a nod from Gujarat High Court; 4,642 students were allotted seats. However, of the 4,642, only 2,091 confirmed their admissions. Another 1,810 children were allotted seats after the third round.

When DNA asked state Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama about the same, he said, ""If there are seats vacant as per 25% reservation and there are eligible students, only then we will conduct the fourth round.

Speaking about the academic loss, Manan Choksi, Executive director, Udgam School for Children and President, Association of Progressive Schools, said, ""As per RTE Act, a student needs to attend 200 days of schooling. However, in the present scenario, half of the year has gone.

"4676","","BENGALURU: As Kerala and Kodagu reeling under floods, help continued to pour in from residents, educational institutions and various government departments in Karnataka.

Over 3,000 private unaided schools will contribute a part of the Right to Education (RTE) reimbursement the government owes to them to the private school disaster management fund to be set up jointly with the education department and institutions. They hope the contributions from RTE payments will be between Rs 6 crore and Rs 10 crore.

The Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said the money should be used by the government for rehabilitation of victims, rebuilding of houses and schools in affected areas.

Shalini Rajneesh, principal secretary, education department, has forwarded a proposal to the chief secretary, seeking approval to open a joint account of the education department and private unaided schools, where schools can deposit the money they raise.

""There are a lot of organizations who have been collecting relief materials and sending them to affected areas. But we don't know if they are reaching the needy. So we decided to donate from the RTE reimbursement. We've requested for a joint account so that even students, teachers and parents can also pitch in,"" said Shashi Kumar, secretary. Education department officials expect an order to be issued with regard to the joint account and disaster management fund by Friday.

The state government this year had almost doubled up the total number of seats for RTE children in the state and had assured smooth admission process. For a total of 112000 seats, the state government had approved 125000 applications. However in the first round, only 80000 seats were allotted out of which nearly 72000 confirmed their admission. The announcement came as a shock to many as state government cited reasons like school preference to be a reason for less seat allotment.

After round 2, Sandeep Munjyasaraa, one of the petitioner in the case wrote to the directorate of primary education demanding clarity on the issue. Speaking with dna, he said, ""Minimum 40,000 students are waiting for admission, how can state only allot 4642 students. Why did they not allow children to make changes in school preference if school the preferred school had gone full in terms of seats? In engineering and medical admissions also, students are given a chance to modify their choices in reshuffling.""

In his letter, Sandeep has stated, ""The second round of admission has been done without application of mind and as a result of it only 4642 children have been given admission out of around 45000 children who were eagerly waiting for the second round admission process. The grave mistake is done by your department and second round of admission has been proceeded without giving any opportunity to the children to modify their choice of schools. You are supposed to provide the opportunity regarding same so that children can modify the same based on the vacancy of the seats available in schools and as a result children maybe successful in getting admission. If the facts and circumstances are other than the mentioned in the complaint, then the same should be communicated in writing within a day of this complaint.""

Further commenting on the issue, Ishu Gupta, a research associate at IIMA's RTE Resource centre said, ""We cannot call it second round and the way it is carried out highlights the intentions of the implementors. This does not give people even a chance to edit their application form, correct theur mistakes and hence it is not a round.""

Talking about second round, MI Joshi, Director, Primary Education had told dna that because most of the students want admission in the school of their choice, seats are lying vacant.

Against a total of 1.15 lakh seats, after two rounds of admissions, more than 30,000 students did not get admission under RTE, despite seats remaining vacant.

Academic experts suggest that due to an abysmal delay in completing the admission process, which lasted nearly two months, several students went on to take admissions on their own. After the first phase of admissions were completed in May, the second phase began only in August.

Sharing more details, M I Joshi, director, state primary education, said, ""The list of students who secured admissions under the second phase of admissions under RTE Act was announced on Tuesday. Some 4,642 students have been allotted admissions and have been intimated about the details.

"4681","","Written by RITU SHARMA | Ahmedabad | Published: August 15, 2018 4:22:31 am The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. (File) Register for RTE or face de-recognition: Education departmentState lags in implementing RTE quota: IIM reportRTE quota: 63 pc seats yet to be filled across MMR

The state government has closed the second round of admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act quota, absorbing only 4,642 of the 53,480 students (about 9.5 per cent) who were left out in the first round of admission. For the remaining 48,838 children from the economically and socially disadvantaged groups, who have been waiting for four months to start school, the wait only gets longer, even as there is a week's window period for the second round of online admissions to conclude. This comes as most of the non-Gujarat board affiliated schools are wrapping up their first semesters.

In the beginning of this academic session, the state Education Department had announced that 1.20 lakh seats in 9,744 private schools across the state have been set aside for admission of students from economically weaker sections under RTE Act's 25 per cent reservation rule. Of the 1.87 lakh applicants, the government after scrutiny approved 1.25 lakh. The first list of 80,199 students was released on April 19. After the admission of the first list closed on May 30, it was found that 71,520 students had taken admissions.

Now after a gap of four months, the government has released the second list of only 4,642 students. This despite the fact that 48,480 seats are still vacant in private schools across the state. ""The reason for this huge number of seats still lying vacant is that these schools do not fit under the RTE rule of a maximum distance of 6 km. All these seats are either in schools that are beyond 6 km (from the place of residence of the child seeking admissions) or there is no school within 6 km-radius of the applicant,"" Director (Primary Education) M I Joshi, who is heading the RTE admissions, said.

The reason cited for the delay in announcing the second list was the ongoing hearing of a PIL filed in the Gujarat High Court for admission under RTE Act in the minority schools. ""Since the minority schools were denying admission to students under the RTE Act and with the PIL we could not go ahead with admissions till the time there was a decision on these seats allotted to these minority schools,"" Joshi added.

Nearly 600 students were denied admissions by 100 schools that claimed to be 'minority institutions', but did not have a valid certificate from the state government. Granting interim relief to the minority schools till August 13, the High Court on July 30 passed an order, stating that schools lacking minority certificate from competent authority could not deny admission to students under the RTE Act, thus clearing the deck for the Education Department to announce the second round of admissions.

According to the Education Department, they waited till August 13 before announcing the second list. ""As no representation from these minority schools was received by the Department till August 13, we went ahead and announced the second round,"" Joshi said. However, sources said that the minority schools have challenged the High Court ruling in the Supreme Court and had given a letter to the Education Department informing about it on Tuesday.

This year, the Education Department did not accept objections from applicants who claimed to be aggrieved by either incorrect school allotment or by an inadvertent error committed by them at the time of filing online applications. ""We did not allow objections this time as it was a foolproof transparent online admission process. Only a few did not get schools of their choice,"" Joshi said.

This year, in a major decision, the state government raised the income bar for both rural and urban residents under the RTE Act by more than 100 per cent -- from the previous annual family income limit of Rs 47,000 for rural areas it was increased to Rs 1.2 lakh, a hike of more than 2.5 times. Similarly, the limit for urban areas was increased by more than double -- from existing Rs 68,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh per annum.

There had been already two previous revisions pertaining to RTE admissions. As per the rule modified by the Education Department and notified on March 4 last year, if seats remained vacant in private schools after admitting students under the 25 per cent quota seats, children belonging to general category with a family income below Rs 68,000 in urban areas and Rs 47,000 in rural areas will be eligible for admissions in these vacant seats.

Speaking to Express, All India Muslim Personal Law Board secretary Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, ""It is an attack on the sovereignty of madrasas. If it is brought under RTE, the government will interfere in their working. Madrasas are protected under Articles 29 and 30 of the Constitution.

On Thursday, the advisory committee cited lack of diversity in subjects taught at madrasas and advocated applicability of the Act to those religious schools. ""The irony is that while missionary schools follow fundamental syllabi like normal schools and have become elitist, madrasas are just imparting religious education,"" a member said.

It is not just minority organisations but madrasa managements also fear that the right of children to free and compulsory education under the Act will end their autonomy.

"4689","","BENGALURU: Vacancies under the Right To Education (RTE) Act have steadily increased over the past four academic years, despite increase in demand among parents of economically backward sections of the society.

Less takers for seats offered by private aided schools, poor school infrastructure, and preference for English medium schools affiliated to CBSE/ICSE boards rather than the state board schools, have been identified as the main reasons for this unhealthy increase in vacancies in RTE seats. As per data available with the department of public instruction, in the current academic year (2018-19), the total seats under RTE quota left vacant in the state is 32,439, which was 19,647 in the previous academic year.

"4691","","Nagpur: The online admission/selection process for Std XI and Right to Education (RTE) has come under fire from activists citing the various technical issues cropping up. The Std XI common admission process (CAP) ran into technical glitches last month and there was controversy related to the allocation matrix of minority college seats.

For RTE's online lottery software, the biggest problems that came to fore were connected with distance mapping. NGO RTE Action Committee has filed a complaint with the education department and is even mulling legal action.

Shahid Sharif, the NGO's founder, said, ""The distance mapping is done through Google maps with the applicant placing the marker balloon at their residence, after which the software calculates the distance to school. But the balloon's placing is not happening properly and causing major chaos during admissions.""

He added that even the Std XI CAP software is facing multiple glitches. ""In the bifocal round itself, which was the first one, names of a few colleges did not reflect in the software's database. Due to this, these colleges lost out in the initial round,"" said Sharif.

An education department employee, however, did not agree with the assessment. ""The balloon placing is done by the applicant and it's working perfectly well. Had there been a problem with the distance marking, then all admissions would have run into trouble. It's clear that the parent or whoever is applying on their behalf is placing the marker incorrectly. Sometimes it is done to get more schools within its ambit,"" said the official who did not wish to be identified.

The software is maintained by National Informatics Centre (NIC) from Pune, which also hosts the education department's HQ. Sharif said, ""There is not even a single person from NIC based in Nagpur and that's why all complaints fall on deaf ears.

Six months after the management of Old Sangvi's National English School told the education department that they had decided to shut down the school due to non-payment of Right to Education (RTE) dues, parents and activists said the management continues to operate on the premises but has not continued RTE quota admissions. Parents and activists have accused the education department of turning a blind eye to the situation.

Activists wrote to Primary Education Director Dinkar Temkar, demanding an inquiry against the school management and also action against local education officer Jyotsna Shinde. In February 2018, parents of RTE quota students had complained to the education department that their children were allegedly not allowed to use the playground or participate in school events. School chairman Dominic Lobo had denied all allegations and had told the primary education department that he was shutting down the school from the next academic year.

But according to parents, Lobo continued to accept fees from students for the next academic year. Parents had complained to the education department, and the Pimpri-Chinchwad education officer was directed to inquire into the matter.

Mukund Kirdat, an AAP activist, said the school is now under a new management, which has kept all the old students except RTE quota ones. ""Without physically inspecting the school, the officer has written that it has shut down and that the RTE students should be placed in other schools. The parents submitted both photo and video proof that the school was running for all old students, except RTE students. Later, we saw boards stating that Priyadarshini Group of Schools had taken over the school, but government officials said they have no record about this. So basically, the old management has handed over the school to a new management and kept all paying students and removed RTE students. How is this legal?"" asked Kirdat.

One of the parents said they have written to the education department demanding to know the current legal status of the school being run on the premises. ""Assuming that the school is shut down, the education department gave our children alternate schools. The school allotted to my child was a semi-government school, where not more than 10 students were studying in Class IV because teaching was not up to the mark. If I wanted to put my child in such a school, why would I take admission in RTE quota? Many of us have taken loans and got our children admitted to private schools. But if the old school is still running, we demand action against them,"" said the parent on condition of anonymity.

Neither Lobo nor Shinde responded to calls or messages. But Jitendra Singh, CEO, Priyadarshini Schools, which has put up a board outside the National School saying it has taken over, said his group had not yet taken over the school.

According to Singh, Lobo approached them in June to take over the school but by then, many students had taken admission elsewhere. ""We ... have not formally taken over the school as the paperwork given by Lobo is not complete. Currently, only one of my administration officials is posted at the school. Until now, it is Lobo who has taken fees from students for this year. The old staff is still teaching there and they are being paid by him,"" he said.

Asked why only fee-paying students were continued and not RTE quota ones, and also if the education department was informed of the takeover, Singh said, ""We have not denied any such parents, maybe they took admissions elsewhere. We are not aware of who the RTE students are ... we agreed to run the school on humanitarian grounds so that students do not have to suffer. But since the paperwork is not done until now, the school is not being run by Priyadarshini Schools.

"4693","","NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Centre to clarify why it has not yet disbursed its entire share of money to the Delhi government for improving infrastructure in government schools to fulfil mandate of the Right to Education Act.

Justice Sidhharth Mridul directed the Centre to inform the court about the amount it has paid for this year after the Delhi government claimed it has received only Rs 160 crore from the overall corpus of Rs 2,100 crore earmarked by the Centre for improving Delhi government schools.

Appearing for AAP government, standing counsel Ramesh Singh told the court that education directorate is facing problems in providing quality education and proper infrastructure partly because of lack of funds from the Centre even though these funds were approved for release.

The court is hearing a batch of petitions filed by children from various government-run schools complaining about the absence of infrastructure and violation of the Right to Education Act.

Appearing for the students, advocate Khagesh Jha highlighted a CAG report that had found last year that the central government disburses the amount almost at the end of the financial year and then utilisation is delayed by the Delhi government, and as a result, fund for education of the children lapses every year.

Jha also cited an RTI reply that said Centre has only dispatched roughly Rs 160 crore which is even less than 10% of their obligation and for this year the central government's obligation was Rs 2,100 crore, which is statutory requirement for the education of children and implementation of the provisions of Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009.

Students told HC in their plea that some of them are studying in schools that run in two shifts as the building is not able to accommodate children of the locality in one shift due to lack of facilities.

The petitioner students added that parents of most students are uneducated and even illiterate and when they had approached the Delhi government, they had been assured that the government is going to construct 1,200 classrooms and 30 new schools in the current financial year, ""but the process is slow due to non-disbursement of funds by the Centre.""","Why RTE funds not given in full, Delhi HC asks Centre - Times of India","917539304","2018-08-02","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/why-rte-funds-not-given-in-full-hc-asks-centre/articleshow/65235430.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4694","","AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Monday cleared the deck for the second round of admissions under the Right to Education (RTE) Act by directing all schools not having status of minority institutions to grant admission to poor kids on 25% of their seats in Class 1.

Incidentally, none of the primary schools, out of over 400 claiming to be of minority status, has got the NOC for exemption under RTE according to the provisions of the National Commission for Minority Education Institution (NCMEI) Act. However, the HC earlier had granted a stay in cases of some of these schools, and the stay will continue till August 13 allowing them time to approach the Supreme Court.

There are 39,914 seats available for RTE admissions in the second round and the state government was not moving ahead with admissions due to the logjam over legalities as over 400 schools claiming minority status refused to grant admission under RTE norms.

A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje made it clear that no school can claim minority status without an NOC from a competent authority either of the state or the Centre under the NCMEI Act. The judges upheld arguments by petitioner Sandip Munjyasara that a school does not attain minority status merely by having members of minority communities in trusts of the institutions. With these observations, the judges ordered all schools not having minority status to admit kids under RTE.

The HC ordered for the second round admission on a plea by another petitioner Chandravadan Dhruv.

This issue first reached the high court in May when the education department threatened action against schools run by religious minorities for not admitting poor kids under RTE. These schools had then approached the HC, which had stayed authorities from taking action.

Later, two PILs were filed complaining that denial by these schools to admissions had blocked the second round of admissions under RTE and there were more than 45,000 children from the unprivileged class waiting for admission.","Gujarat HC clears the deck for 2nd round of RTE admissions - Times of India","916066341","2018-07-31","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/hc-clears-the-deck-for-2nd-round-of-rte-admissions/articleshow/65205316.cms","The Times of India",FALSE
"4695","","A division bench of the Gujarat high court headed by justice MR Shah on Monday said that only those minority schools that had taken the requisite No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the concerned authorities were exempted from admitting students under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

The court also asked the state to ensure that students, who were left out of admission under RTE, are considered. This could pave the way for second round of admission under RTE.

The court's order came in connection with several petitions related to RTE. One involved minority schools moving the court on the grounds that their minority status exempted them from RTE while another petition had sought direction to the state government to begin second round of admission under RTE as over 40,000 students were yet to get admission.

The court, in its order, said article 30 allowed for religious minorities and linguistic minorities to establish minority institution of choice. ""As per an SC ruling they are exempted from RTE but such institutions need to get NOC from the competent authorities. They cannot automatically claim minority status,"" the court observed.

It said that the DEO's order directing the minority schools to admit students under RTE was not illegal and arbitrary.

It also directed the state to ensure that the students who were yet to be admitted under RTE were given admission as per their choice of schools but subject to the 25% limit for each school. The court also asked the government to consider those RTE applications that were rejected on technical grounds.

Meanwhile, some of the schools sought continuation of the interim order -- which prevented the state from carrying out penal action against schools that had refused admission to students under RTE -- so that they can appeal the matter in the Supreme Court. The high court granted them time of a fortnight.

The state had opposed the move on the grounds that over 1,000 children, who were given admission to minority schools, were still waiting to be admitted and they had already lost two precious months and granting a stay would only further the waiting period.","Minority schools sans NOC not exempt from RTE: Gujarat High Court","916006713","2018-07-31","http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-minority-schools-sans-noc-not-exempt-from-rte-gujarat-high-court-2643733","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE

The Gujarat High Court on Monday held that primary schools that run by minority trusts but don't have certificate for being minority schools will have to admit students under the Right To Education Act (RTE). The court while disposing off a public interest litigation (PIL) and a set of special civil applications held that minority schools are however exempted from the 2009 Act, under which private schools have to keep 25 per cent of seats for children from ""disadvantaged and weaker sections"".

The Division Bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje pronounced the judgment on a set of petitions moved by over 170 schools, run by minority trusts, including Mar Gregorious Othodox Syrian Church, Vadodara; Ayyappa Education Centre, Vadodara; Rajkot Kelavani Samaj, among others.

During the hearing, the state government had submitted that petitioner schools don't have certificates of minority primary schools. The state's contention was that trusts of these schools have acquired minority status for secondary and higher secondary schools, but not for primary schools. It said that the competent authority never granted minority status to the primary schools.

The state submitted that only those schools are exempted from the RTE Act that have minority school certificates. In its affidavits, the state said that communication issued from the Director of Primary Education specifically stated that ""any school which is claiming to have status of minority is required to produce a valid certificate of status of minority qua primary section issued by the office of Director of Primary Education...under the provisions of The National Commission for Minority Educational Institution"".

Members of the group also demanded that the state take over private schools and completely ban coaching institutes to improve the quality of education.

""In India, 50% children fail to complete their Class 8 and 50% of these children are forced to work as child labourers. Unless we have free and compulsory quality education, the country will not progress and the only way to achieve this is by having a common school system,"" said social activist Sandeep Pandey, adding that he would not hesitate to sit on an indefinite strike to force the governments of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh to implement the RTE.

He also called on the state authorities to make it mandatory for all government employees, including bureaucrats and politicians, to admit their wards into government schools if they are really serious about improving the quality of education in Telangana.

On the issue of RTE, the participants collectively blamed corporate colleges, which they said were conniving with private schools to stall its implementation for fear of it reducing their probability of getting more ranks in competitive exams. Advocate Yogesh Tandava, who filed a PIL in the Hyderabad high court over the non-implementation of RTE in the two Telugu states, said that enforcing RTE would make the state better as it would promote communal harmony and social integration.

""This is not just about admitting economically backward children into private schools.

Not implementing it is not just affecting poor people, but also students from middle and rich classes who are being deprived of the opportunity of studying in an inclusive environment,"" said Tandava, adding that there is no question of private schools running into losses because of RTE as education is meant to be a non-profitable profession.

Pointing out how just about 10% of schools in the state, who collects lakhs of rupees in fees, are against RTE, the participants said it is time the government makes private schools redundant. They also asked the state to make sure that students are enrolled in 'age-appropriate' classes as it is of no use if a child completes his/her Class 10 at the age of 20.","Common school system can ensure literacy, enforce RTE - Times of India","915058524","2018-07-29","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/common-school-system-can-ensure-literacy-enforce-rte/articleshow/65184134.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

According to the civic education department, only 45 per cent students have confirmed their seats till now. There is no word yet on when the admission process under the RTE quota will be complete even as civic officials say the process is lagging behind as there are not enough students seeking the allotted seats.

A senior official of the department said, ""Even after the second lottery round, very few students showed interest in securing admissions. We will not be able to proceed till the minimum required seats are filled.""

As per the schedule, parents had time till June 30 to complete the admission process but out of the 2,382 allotted seats, only 737 have been confirmed.

""Maybe they are not happy with the allotted seats, which is why they are not taking admission and waiting for other schools through further rounds,"" the official added.

"4703","","AHMEDABAD: Gujarat high court on Tuesday posed a question before the schools who claim minority institution status on why there should be a provision in law to obtain certificate from authorities on minority status. A bench of Justice M R Shah and Justice A Y Kogje questioned so during the hearing of various petitions as well as two PILs on provisions of admission under the Right to Education (RTE) Act in primary schools being run by the minority education institutions. The question arose when one of the petitioners, Sandip Munjyasara, submitted that none of the schools, claiming to be run by minority institutions, have the certificate showing their minority status, which is required to be obtained from either the director of primary education or the National Commission for Minority Education Institutions (NCMEI). There is a provision under the NCMEI Act that the minority run education institute must obtain certificate of its status.

Earlier, a single-judge bench has stayed the state government to take any action against nearly 400 schools for denying RTE admissions on their claims to be minority institutions. This has left nearly 8,000 poor children stranded in the first round of RTE admissions when minority institutes refused them admissions. This dispute has practically delayed the second round of RTE admission, where there are 45,000 applicants against 39,914 seats available, according to the state government.

In reply, the advocates representing schools submitted that the trusts running the schools were formed by people from minority communities. They are not required to obtain any certificate in this regard.

The state government submitted that after it contemplated action against these schools for denying RTE admissions, some of these schools have filed applications for the certification.

Petitioner Munjyasara also submitted that if the schools can prove their minority status, it is not his demand that poor students should be granted admission in these schools. But, their status is required to be verified and it is possible by scrutiny of trust deeds.

Earlier, the petitioner had spoken against such schools and said that under the National Commission for Minorities Institution Act, the state and central government were to nominate a competent authority. Such an authority was to give a no objection certificate to the minority institution for it to be declared one.

"4707","","""They fail because they are afraid, bored and confused"" (John Holt, How Children Fail)

The Lok Sabha on Saturday, passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, revoking the no-detention policy. It is likely that given the support across parties, it will pass through the Rajya Sabha too. Even so, it is necessary to continue this conversation and inform both the public and policy-makers about the potential damage of this reversal.

Section 16 of the RTE Act that earlier prohibited from holding back a child in any class cannot be read in isolation, and no detention did not ever mean no assessment. Section 16 should have been read in conjunction with Section 29 that talks about Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation and ""making the child free of fear, trauma and anxiety"".

The revised Section 16 has the provision for having examinations in classes 5 and 8, and sub-section 3 also allows ""schools to hold back a child... if he fails in the re-examination"". Going by ASER data, roughly half of the children in classes 5 and 8 are a few classes lower in terms of learning outcomes than the class they study in, and hence, would fail their exams. Re-examination is an important element of the amendment. The additional instruction will have some associated costs too - it may require additional training, special curricula, and if regular teachers are not available during the two-month window, some honorarium for part-time or volunteer teachers may need to disbursed. Additional remedial interventions like these can cost Rs 800 - 1,000 per child, but even the most cost-efficient program will have an average cost of Rs 2501. Assuming 30 per cent of children in classes 5 and 8 fail their first attempt and have to undergo the additional instruction. This would translate to 61 lakh children in rural government schools, and the cost of providing such programs would be Rs 150 crore.

Now, this does not seem much given the scale of the public education system in India. But while some children may pass this re-examination and some may drop-out, others will repeat the same class. Let us say 25 per cent of the 61 lakh children have to repeat a year. Assuming an average expenditure of Rs 12,700 per child, this would mean an additional financial burden of over Rs 1,900 crore. To put this in perspective, this equates to 8 per cent of the Rs 26,129 crore Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) budget for 2018-19.

There is a way to test the students and there are consequences of students not clearing the test will act as a motivation,"" said the teacher.

He said what was happening was that a child would score zero in a subject but he would still be promoted. ""As long as he made it to the next class, there was no fear of lagging behind literally even if he was lagging behind in his studies,""said the teacher.

Sukhdev Patel, who has worked on RTE since it was first conceptualised, said the 'detention' policy being proposed shows that the Indian psyche can't think beyond exams. ""I am not against evaluating children. Let there be exams in secondary and higher secondary schools. World over, children in primary schools are evaluated and when found lacking, the teachers work on their weaknesses. It is only in India that we are obsessed with 'failing' a student,"" said Patel.

He said the argument that students do not take studies seriously if there are no exams is rubbish. ""It is nothing but an excuse for the state government and teachers to hide their failure. Everyone is talking of how the no detention policy was affecting education but no one is breathing a word about an earlier amendment that talked of comprehensive and continuous evaluation,"" said Patel. He said the evaluation was meant to address the deficiencies of no detention policy. ""But the state government did not bother to implement continuous and comprehensive evaluation,"" said Patel.

He said the statements by the education minister that the no detention was affecting the education outcomes in Gujarat was nothing but an excuse. ""You can look at the education indices of the state before 2009 when RTE was not in place. Gujarat has not improved much. The no detention policy is an excuse to hide our poor performance,"" said Patel.

Punjab: FB video heats up Khaira-Balbir feudHappiness classes in Delhi govt schools to begin from next week: Manish SisodiaL-G orders officer reshuffle, Manish Sisodia calls move illegal

With the Lok Sabha passing the amendment to the Right to Education Act (2009), the Delhi government has decided to do away with the ""No Detention Policy"". With the amendment, states can scrap the policy wherein children, from classes III to VIII, were not detained even if they failed the examination.

""It is yet to be passed in the Rajya Sabha, so we are waiting for it. Once it is passed, we will be working to bring back detention,"" said Atishi Marlena, former advisor to Education Minister Manish Sisodia.

From the very beginning, when the proposal for the amendment was moved by the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD), Sisodia has voiced support to scrap the policy.

The government justified the stand, stating that no detention policy leads to children being promoted without learning, and that scrapping the policy would lead to improved learning levels.

According to a source, the government will work to bring back detention from the next academic session, and consult parents and teachers on the same.

Sisodia has also been in favour of scrapping the policy as he received complaints from teachers about its negative impact on learning, said the source.

""It's a good thing that the amendment to the RTE Act has been passed. As children could not be detained, parents and children did not take the process seriously, thinking they will be promoted anyway. Now, the process is going to get better,"" said Sapna Singh, a government school teacher.

However, experts argued against the removal of the policy, claiming that it would lead to an increase in the number of dropouts.

""It is the poor quality of education, lack of infrastructure, teacher vacancies and the presence of untrained teachers that may have an effect on learning outcomes. The no detention clause, one of the most critical parts of the RTE Act that has been pulled out, has put the entire RTE Act at risk of disintegration. The greatest negative impact will be on disadvantaged groups, first generation learners and Adivasi students, as well as girls,"" said Ambarish Rai, national convenor, Right to Education Forum.","To 'improve learning', Delhi govt to scrap no detention policy after RTE amendment","909006321","2018-07-19","https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/to-improve-learning-delhi-govt-to-scrap-no-detention-policy-after-rte-amendment-5266788/","The Indian Express",FALSE
"4713","","New Delhi: A bill to amend the Right to Education (RTE) Act to abolish the 'no detention policy' in schools was passed in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

Replying to the debate in the Lok Sabha on The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (second amendment) Bill, 2017, Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that it will be at the discretion of the states whether to continue with no detention or not.

The states, he said, will decide at what level and who will conduct the examination, the minister said.

""It is a broken education system. We have to rebuild our education system,"" he added.

Under the current provisions of the RTE Act, no student can be detained till Class VIII and all students are promoted to the next grade.

The minister said that in some of the states like Sikkim , Kerala and Telangana, the students, who were studying in private schools, have come back to government schools.

""Teacher training, quality and accountability are most important,"" Javadekar said.

Stating that there was no shortages of teachers, the minister, however, added that the deployment of teachers was not right.

While moving the bill in the Lok Sabha, the minister said, ""It is a very important legislation and a majority of state governments supported this Centre's proposal. It brings accountability in our elementary education system.""

Referring to the no-detention policy in the Act, the minister said ""schools have become only schools for mid-day meal as education and learning are missing"".

This bill has also been analysed by the standing committee and the panel also recommended bringing back the concept of detention in schools, the minister added.

The policy had been brought as it was felt that compelling children to repeat a class was demotivating, often forcing them to abandon school, he said.

This bill provides for a regular examination in Classes V and VIII and if the child fails, he or she shall be given additional opportunity for re-examination in two months' time, Javadekar said.

Speaking on the bill, Congress MP KC Venugopal said that the proposed legislation lacks ""clarity"".

""This bill needs clarity. It should be clarified that whether the Centre or the states will conduct the exams,"" Venugopal said.

He also demanded a hike in the allocation for Centre's flagship programme Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan.

Echoing similar sentiments, BJD MP Bhartruhari Mahtab said the government should form uniform guidelines for conducting exams and leave it to the state on how the exams should be conducted.

Arvind Sawant of Shiv Sena and Saugat Roy of the TMC also lent support to the bill.

Sawant asked the government to focus on primary education.

Roy praised Javadekar for his ""non-confrontationist"" approach as he supported the bill.

Children often do not study if there are no exams, he said, adding that education system is currently in a bad shape and learning outcomes were going down due to non-detention policy.

""The education system is like an inverted pyramid and adequate focus has not been given to primary education,"" he said.

Supriya Sule of NCP also supported the bill and said introduction of exams was necessary.

Prem Singh Chandumajra of Akali Dal and Sanjay Jaiswal of BJP also spoke in support of the Bill.

Several members demanded that teachers should also be made accountable for learning outcomes.

"4715","","NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Right to Education Act, doing away with the no-detention policy that prohibits schools from detaining students till they complete elementary education.

The amendment allows states to hold a regular examination at the end of Classes 5 and 8. According to the amendment bill, a child who fails in the examination held after Classes 5 and 8 will be given additional instruction and the opportunity to appear for a re-examination.

This examination must be held within a period of two months from the date of the declaration of the result. If the child still does not pass the exam, the state government may decide to detain them. However, no child can be expelled from school before they complete elementary education, the amendment bill states.

The proposed amendment was introduced in August last year and referred to a Standing Committee of the Rajya Sabha. The committee submitted its report to both the Houses of Parliament in February, endorsing the amendment bill ""in its present form"".

The no-detention policy of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, banned the practice of making under-performing children repeat classes in elementary school - Classes 1 to 8 - to ensure they do not drop out of school. It was meant to reduce the emphasis on year-end examinations and replace it with a form of evaluation that would track students' progress through the year.

However, the present government feels that the lack of ""pass-fail"" system has led to deterioration in quality of learning in schools as evident in the poor results of the National Assessment Survey carried out by the Union Human Resources Development Ministry and NCERT.","Lok Sabha passes amendment to RTE Act to re-introduce 'pass-fail' system in schools","908085936","2018-07-18","http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2018/jul/18/lok-sabha-passes-amendment-to-rte-act-to-re-introduce-pass-fail-system-in-schools-1845171.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

The government had filed the affidavit on Monday after a division bench headed by Justice MR Shah sought a detailed break up from the government of the reasons under which the 3,097 applications were rejected.

The state said in the affidavit, that on verification it was found that 2,208 applicants had provided an income certificate that was not issued by the Mamlatdar. The state also said that it was in the process of taking action against such applicants.

The affidavit said that to ensure a level playing field for children from weaker sections of society who were admitted to schools under RTE, it had directed the DEO and the DPEOs to hold a meeting with schools under its jurisdiction. The officials were to hold a meeting with the school authorities to provide a proper environment to the students and to also carry out counselling sessions for both the students and the parents. It also advised the schools to carry out a pre-meeting with parents whose children were admitted to the schools under RTE.

The state also informed the court that that of the 80,165 students who were granted admission, the admission of only 72, 294 were confirmed. The remaining would be given admission during the second round. It also stated that the 80,165 students were granted admission as per the criteria which ordains that the schools are not more than 6 km away from the residence of the child.","Most RTE applications rejected due to fake income certificate: Gujarat govt to HC","907654599","2018-07-18","http://www.dnaindia.com/ahmedabad/report-most-rte-applications-rejected-due-to-fake-income-certificate-gujarat-govt-to-hc-2638577","Daily News and Analysis (DNA) India",FALSE
"4996","","SRINAGAR -- Jammu and Kashmir Joint Coordination Committee of Private Schools (JKJCCPS) Wednesday said the private schools don't charge fee or hike it arbitrarily but fol­low the fee that is approved by Fee Fixation Committee. The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its in­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at in­ternational level."" About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion.

In the wake of Thursday's school van accident in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar, in which 13 children died on the spot, the School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) will soon meet the transport commissioner to request disallowing vans from ferrying more students than the vehicle's seating capacity permits. The SBOA will request the transport commissioner to stop giving permits to such small vans in the city and state.

While 13 school children died, eight students suffered injuries in an accident that happened on Thursday morning at Bahpurva railway crossing. This is not the first time that students have been victim to such accidents, claimed SBOA. According to them, the reason behind such accidents is that the number of students taken in such vans is beyond the capacity.

Anil Garg from SBOA said, ""We have decided to meet the transport commissioner soon to request them to stop issuing permits to small vans that ferry school children more than their seating capacity.

Rental car company Hertz will no longer offer a discount program to NRA members and First National Bank of Omaha, one of the nation's largest private banks, said it will not renew a co-branded Visa credit card it has with the NRA.","Corporates cut off National Rifle Association after latest school shooting - Ahmedabad Mirror","821696268","2018-02-24","http://ahmedabadmirror.indiatimes.com/news/world/corporates-cut-off-nra-after-latest-shooting/articleshow/63071452.cms","Ahmedabad Mirror",FALSE

"5008","","PARKLAND: The troubled teen authorities say killed 17 people at a Florida high school excelled in an air-rifle marksmanship program supported by a grant from the National Rifle Association Foundation, part of a multimillion-dollar effort by the gun group to support youth shooting clubs and other programs.

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was wearing a maroon shirt with the logo from the Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when he was arrested shortly after the shooting.

Former JROTC cadets told The Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the small varsity marksmanship team that trained together after class and traveled to other area schools to compete.

It was a close-knit group. One of the other cadets started calling Cruz ""Wolf,"" and the nickname stuck.

""He was a very good shot,"" said Aaron Diener, 20, who gave Cruz a ride to shooting competitions when they were part of the same four-member team in 2016.

""He had an AR-15 he talked about, and pistols he had shot. ... He would tell us, Oh, it was so fun to

shoot this rifle or It was so fun to shoot that. It seemed almost therapeutic to him, the way he spoke about it.""

The JROTC marksmanship program used air rifles special-made for target shooting, typically on indoor ranges at targets the size of a coin.

Records show that the Stoneman Douglas JROTC program received USD 10,827 in non-cash assistance from the NRAs fundraising and charitable arm in 2016, when Cruz was on the squad. The schools

program publicly thanked the NRA Foundation on its Twitter feed.

A spokeswoman for the NRA declined to comment on Friday. The top officers of the foundation are all current or former executives of the NRA.

The more than 1,700 high school JROTC programs nationally also receive financial support from the US military and are typically supervised by retired officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.

The military collaborates with school systems on the training curriculum, which includes marching drills, athletic competitions and shooting teams.

Cadets wear military uniforms with ranks and insignias similar to those of the military branch with which they are affiliated.

Peter Mahmood, the retired Army major who supervises the JROTC program at Stoneman Douglas, did not respond to messages left by phone and at his home.

Authorities say Cruz, who was expelled last year for disciplinary reasons, walked into his former school with an AR-15 and opened fire. He is charged with 17 counts of murder.

The shooting teams equipment came in handy for some students during the chaos of the rampage. Junior Colton Haab, a second lieutenant and platoon leader in the schools JROTC, told The Associated Press that he helped usher about 90 students into the room where cadets train with pellet rifles. Haab moved the Kevlar sheets used as a backdrop for target practice away from the wall and told everyone to hide behind them. As it was, the shooter never approached the ROTC rooms.

Haab said he sees nothing negative about the NRAs contribution to the ROTC program. In fact, he said, the equipment the group funded could have helped save the students lives if the gunman had targeted them.

""So I think the NRA actually bonused us in a way,"" he said.

Former cadets say they were surprised the awkward teen they remember from a couple years ago now stands accused of slaughtering students and staff. But, in retrospect, there were signs of trouble.

Kyle Ramos, who was the executive officer of the JROTC battalion, said Cruz spoke about guns and knives incessantly and liked to wear military-style clothing to school. He also bragged about shooting animals for fun.

""He told me he would attack little animals with pellet guns and stuff, and I was a little weirded out by that,"" said Ramos, now 20.

""Like squirrels and lizards and stuff."" Diener said Cruz sometimes missed target practice because he had detention. There was another time he remembers that Aaron Feis, a member of the schools security staff, came to get Cruz out of JROTC class because he was in some sort of trouble. Feis, who was also an assistant football coach at the school, is among those Cruz is charged with killing.

The NRA Foundation gave nearly USD 2.2 million to schools across 30 states in 2016, the most recent year for which its federal tax filings are publicly available.

Of that amount, more than USD 400,000 was in cash grants, while nearly USD 1.8 million came as in-kind donations ranging from equipment for high school air rifle teams to gun safety programs for younger children.

Most of the schools that receive grants are in public districts.","Florida shooting suspect was in school rifle team that got National Rifle Association grant","814733360","2018-02-17","http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2018/feb/17/florida-shooting-suspect-was-in-school-rifle-team-that-got-national-rifle-association-grant-1774679.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

A 13-year-old boy, a student of class 6 of a private school in east Delhi, suffered multiple injuries after he fell down from the third floor of the school building Friday morning. He is battling for life in a city hospital.

The incident took place around 8.30am, soon after the morning assembly prayers. The boy is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital and is unfit for recording a statement. No case was registered in connection with the incident, the police said.

The boy's family blamed the authorities of the school for the incident. They alleged that no safety measures were in place at the school premises to avoid such an incident. The family also suspected foul play and demanded a probe to ascertain the circumstances under which the student fell off the building.

The school authorities, on the other hand, ruled out foul play and said they were extending their cooperation in the police enquiry. A senior school administration official said the footage of the CCTV cameras was checked.

""The footage shows the boy having an argument with some fellow students after which he ran to the third floor and jumped. A staffer was present on the third floor but by the time she could stop him, the student had jumped. We rushed the student to the hospital,"" the school official said.

Police said they have initiated an enquiry to ascertain whether the boy attempted suicide or accidentally fell off the building. The footage of the CCTV cameras is also being analysed. The statement of some students was also recorded, they added.

""The boy is still under medical observation. Once he is declared fit, we will record his statement to ascertain the exact sequence of events which led to his fall from the building,"" Ved Prakash Surya, additional deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said.

"5013","","A private school in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh on Thursday punished students who came late by making them stand naked outside the school building. Images of the punished students, who went to Chaitanya Bharathi School at Punganur, were subsequently posted on Twitter.

According to reports, a complaint was registered against the school management, and education authorities have begun investigating the incident. There are also demands to cancel the school's registration.

This is not the first time such an incident has been reported in the state. NDTV reported that in 2015, two students of a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal were hospitalised after a teacher allegedly asked them to take off their shirts and stand in the sun, as punishment for not doing their homework.

The students, who are brothers, reportedly collapsed after standing in the heat for nearly three hours. Two teachers, Rani Kumari and Anil Kumar were suspended, The News Minute reported.

The incident came days after a 13-year-old student in Andhra Pradesh alleged that her school principal forced her to take a pregnancy test, over suspicions that she was having an affair with a teacher.

Activists, social media hits back

Following the incident, child rights activists and netizens alike condemned the incident. Child rights activists have alleged that the principal of the private school and the local divisional educational officer tried to hush up the incident when the video of punishment went viral and the parents lodged a protest, India Today reported.

India Today also quoted activist Achyut Rao as saying: ""We earnestly request the (National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights) to issue orders to initiate action under the provisions of Posco Act and immediately order an enquiry.""

"5015","","Sir,

Please refer to the news item ""Roofless polling station leaves staff shocked"" wherein it has been reported that the school building selected for the polling station in the village ""Lambi Keri""falling under block Khwas was found roofless. In this context, I would like to draw the attention of the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir State towards the miserable condition of School Education Department. It is a matter of utter shame and shock that all of the concerned authorities of education and administrative sectors seem to have been sleeping since long and remained quite ignorant about the plight of the said school building till the date of election.

To my knowledge and experience, the concerned school teacher/headmasters have to submit a detailed report about the status of school building to the concerned higher authority every month. And if the concerned school teacher/headmaster was sincere enough to submit the monthly reports, the concerned higher authorities including ZEO,ZEPO,CEO, etc are fully responsible and answerable in the matter. The factual story appearing in this paper reveals that either the school teachers remain absent from the school or they have not reported the matter to the concerned authorities. It also indicates that the concerned administrative authorities are totally negligent towards their duties. Moreover, the concerned authorities of SSA associated with the construction of school buildings are also responsible for the poor quality of school building. There may be so many other school buildings lying unreported leading to suffering of poor students.

One of the main reasons beyond this scenario is that these Government schools are meant only for the students of rural poor parents and none of the concerned authorities including teachers,ZEOs , CEO, legislators and other officers do never even think about sending their own children to the Government schools.

However,it is suggested that the instant case of the roofless school building should be got investigated by a commission headed by the concerned Deputy Commissioner and all those found guilty should be punished under the provisions of Criminal Procedure Code so that justice is done to all concerned and none could dare to deviate from the duty and responsibility in future.

Secretary of CEC Phangsang, Temjenmangyang Jamir, in a press release, said that the students and the teachers have had to undergo a lot of hardships throughout the academic years because of the 'ramshackle school building.'

He said that rainwater leaks through the roof and also through the holes 'in the decaying bamboo walls' that flood the classrooms as well as the teachers' common room.

A spot inspection was also conducted in presence of officers from the PWD (Building), the contractor involved in executing the work as well as representative from the consultant agency responsible for monitoring the progress of the project.

During the inspection, Syiem questioned the officers and contractor as to why the project could not be completed even after being given an additional timeframe for completion of the project; their reply was that it is because of revision of the Bill of Quantities (BOQ) which was approved recently.

""The undue delay in completing of the project has created difficulties and inconvenience for smooth functioning of the school which is a matter of serious concern"" Syiem said during the inspection while urging the officials concerned and the contractor to take serious steps for early completion of the project for the benefit of the school children of the area.

Meanwhile, the contractor had assured and expressed his commitment to the local legislator that the construction work would be completed within the month of December this year following which it could be handed over to the school authority.

It may be mentioned through this project, the ADB aims at improving the secondary education in the state and also upgrade the teaching and learning in government-aided secondary and higher secondary schools, improve technical and vocational education and training, and raise awareness about the importance of education.

UDHAMPUR, Oct 22: Students of Government High School Nalla Mallian, in Zone Ghordi and locals of the area held protest today, demanding repair of school building.

The protesting students and villagers raised slogans against the Education Department and Udhampur District Administration and PMGSY. They alleged that there was no repair of school building including bathroom and kitchen shed for the last one year and student are forced to read under the open sky and unsafe building.

The locals said that one year ago Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) wing of R&B Department, started construction of 6.5 kms road from Tantha to Nalla Mallian. But due to digging extensive damage was caused to the schools building. Water pipeline, bathrooms were also damaged. Moreover, this school is without Headmaster for the last two years. The concerned authorities did not bother about the matter. The locals appealed to the Advisor and the Governor to take cognizance of the matter.","Students, villagers protest; demand repair of school building","975896602","2018-10-22","http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/students-villagers-protest-demand-repair-school-building-2/","Jammu Kashmir Latest News | Tourism | Breaking News J&K",FALSE
"5028","","NEW DELHI: FAWAD (name changed) was in Class 1 when he first heard that his school will operate from a proper building, not under makeshift classrooms inside an Eidgah at Quresh Nagar in central Delhi.

Now a Class 8 student, Fawad, in between giggles of his friends during recess, is much smarter. He harbours little hope of any perceptible change in the study conditions. ""We don't think the school will have a building of its own anytime soon,"" asserts one of his friends.

In 1976, the four-storey Qaumi Senior Secondary School at Sadar Bazar was razed to the ground during the Emergency period. The Central Board of Secondary Examination-affiliated school was then shifted to a DDA Colony, but it neither got land nor building.

Things have not changed much even as four decades passed by. Thirteen 'classrooms' with tin shed roofs and walls are built in L-shape at the corner of the Eidgah premises. A ceiling fan, a blackboard on a stand and rusted iron benches comprise each 'classroom'. The principal's office and the teachers' room are adjusted in between.

As a senior secondary boys' school with around 800 students at present, classes run in two shifts due to space constraint. While Class 6- 8 are held in the morning, the primary classes take place in the evening.

Like Fawad, other students and teachers have adjusted to their makeshift arrangements. However, they admit that it is better to have a building than operating from a temporary place.

The wait seems to be endless. In August, the High Court had directed the Delhi Development Authority to allocate 4,000 square yards of land for a school building and complete all formalities with regards to the land in the next three months. A month-and-a-half has passed already and the school is yet to receive the documents, said a faculty.

School principal Mohabbat Ali is hopeful that a plot will be allotted, probably at a nearby vacated slaughterhouse site, for the school building in the wake of the high court order. He, however, is reluctant to speak further, saying it was a 'court matter'.","Forty years on, school awaits building","968989588","2018-10-14","http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2018/oct/14/forty-years-on-school-awaits-building-1885127.html","The New Indian Express",FALSE

"5032","","The first thing to know as a founder in Tacklebox Accelerator is that you will not ""move fast and break things.""

That mantra, once touted by Facebook and other tech companies, is antithetical to the Tacklebox approach to entrepreneurship. At the first of each session's six workshops, Tacklebox founder Brian Scordato says as much to the founders seated before him.Instead, Tacklebox is about making slow and steady progress. Case in point: Scordato advises the founders not to quit their day job until they're (almost) certain their business is viable.

Launched in 2015, Tacklebox is a six-week program during which Scordato guides about eight founders, many of whom still have full-time jobs, in bringing their business ideas to fruition. Tacklebox isn't an accelerator in the traditional sense: Founders don't give up equity in their companies; instead, they pay $2,500 to attend what can seem like ""startup school.""

The goal, Scordato said, is to show founders that successful entrepreneurship is, above all, ""practice-able and teachable and learnable.""

Admittedly, the slow-and-steady strategy isn't the sexiest. A story about an entrepreneur who up and quit her day job to pursue her startup dreams is generally much more compelling than an entrepreneur who waited it out until the time was just right.

But Scordato makes a persuasive case for caution. ""You're always proving that this is worth your time,"" he told me.

""A lot of our founders have really, really good jobs and they've busted their asses to create a little bit of savings,"" he said. ""Most of our founders don't come in and say, 'I hate my job; I want to leave.' It's more like, 'I really, really like my job. It's helped me gain this certain insight and I want to start a company based on that. But I want to make sure that it's worth leaving this awesome job for it.'""What's more, he said, having a full-time job means you necessarily have limited time to work on your business. So you have to prioritize, and do only the tasks that are most important. ""It's interesting how it works when you force yourself into the confines to really focus on the 80/20 stuff,"" Scordato said, referring to

Scordato's observations are backed by some research and anecdotal evidence.

In his 2016 book, ""Originals,"" Wharton professor Adam Grant wrote that, contrary to popular belief, the most successful entrepreneurs don't quit their day job to start a company. One University of Wisconsin study found that entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs were 33% less likely to fail than those who don't.

Grant cites the example of Bill Gates, who was testing his idea for Microsoft on the side before he took a leave of absence from Harvard to go all in.

Similarly, Kathryn Minshew, cofounder and CEO of The Muse, didn't quit her job at McKinsey until she was confident in the strength of her business. And the founders of jewelry company Aurate told Business Insider that starting a business on the side, while they were employed at Marc Jacobs and Goldman Sachs, made them better entrepreneurs.

""Some people think about founders and think about startups as 23-year-olds starting something, and it's actually a good idea for them to do it even if it fails. It's a cool life experience,"" Scordato said. ""That's for the most part not my founders. My founders have enormous opportunity cost for starting these things.""

Scordato also looks specifically for founders who have developed domain expertise over the course of their career. ""You should have been subconsciously preparing to build this company for a long time, in a way such that your skill sets and knowledge bases have already distanced you from any competition,"" he said.

Indeed, an MIT study found the average age of a successful startup founder is 45. The study authors found that work experience explains much of the age advantage. They write in the Harvard Business Review,""Relative to founders with no relevant experience, those with at least three years of prior work experience in the same narrow industry as their startup were 85% more likely to launch a highly successful startup.""

I sat in on two of the workshops and listened to a recording of a third. At the first workshop, Scordato told the founders that sometimes, people get to the end of the program and realize they don't want to launch their startup. ""That's OK, too,"" he said.

I was skeptical: Who spends six weeks and $2,500, only to realize that, oops, their business idea stinks? But the Tacklebox alums I spoke to said they'd rather spend some time and money to realize their business idea isn't workable than quit their jobs and blow a huge amount of cash, only to reach the same conclusion a year down the line.

Shawn Cheng, a partner at the venture production studio ConsenSys Labs, has been a mentor to Scordato and to Tacklebox founders; he told me that the biggest value of the program is learning ""how to learn,"" or learning ""how to walk away.""

Most startup accelerators take an ""all or nothing"" approach, Cheng said, in that you either build a company or waste everyone's time; Tacklebox is geared toward founders thinking that ""they have an idea and they want to be testing it, and they want to be talking to more people about it, but they're not quite sure how they should validate it in order to put everything else in their lives on hold to pursue it.""

Sam Alston, the founder of Big Lives, which identifies up-and-coming fashion designers, was in the eighth cohort of Tacklebox, in 2017. She credits the program with giving her the confidence to leave her job, as a client development director at Louis Vuitton.

Alston said she frequently recommends Tacklebox to aspiring entrepreneurs, noting that Scordato is transparent about the fact that ""the skills that you gain should allow you to then test any business idea"" - not just the one you're currently working on. ""It's really selling a framework rather than consulting on a specific business.""

Scordato also told me that a handful of founders have gone through Tacklebox with one business idea, realized they didn't like it, and waited another year or so before going through Tacklebox again with a better one.

It's a program Scordato might have benefited from earlier in his career. In the past 11 years, he's launched three startups, aside from Tacklebox: a recruiting platform for college basketball, a dating app, and a social-networking app. None of them are still in operation.Scordato's real talent seems to be spotting other entrepreneurs with potential, and giving them the guidance and mentorship they need to develop their nascent businesses. He also brings in a series of outside experts, including successful founders and investors like Cheng. Each cohort of founders gets a chance to pitch their businesses to a group of investors, less to convince them to sign on and more to get feedback about how well they articulate their business' mission and goals.

Chuugani is glad he went through Tacklebox before Y Combinator. He told me that, in Y Combinator, after three months, if you don't think your idea is viable, it's a much more high-stakes situation. ""You're forced to find any idea that might work,"" he said, ""because now you've raised money from the accelerator."" He added, ""YC changed my life,"" but ""you should be a little bit prepared to know what you're getting yourself into if you're going to raise money.""

Despite Chhugani's success, Scordato said that the majority of Tacklebox startups aren't suited to Y Combinator. The Lobby ""has the potential to be a very high-growth, very huge exit sort of company,"" but it's an exception.

Some founders go onto more niche accelerators, like New York Fashion Tech Lab - but for about half of Tacklebox startups, Scordato said, ""maybe they need a little bit of money to build the initial tech platform, or they need to hire someone to do that, but it's not going to be a big challenge. They can start operating and become profitable quickly.""

Lee, the 37Angels founder, said Scordato and Tacklebox are more open-minded about success than most other startup accelerators. That is to say, getting into the uber-selective Y Combinator isn't the only measure of success.

Lee mentioned the concept of ""lifestyle startups,"" a term that's emerged in the last decade to describe a business that doesn't need venture capital and won't necessarily be worth $1 billion, ever. Lee said the term is often perceived negatively; but lifestyle startups, she said, are welcomed at Tacklebox. A lifestyle startup can still bring in $10 million a year, she said - and ""since when did making $10 million a year become a failure?""

""We LOVE those,"" Scordato wrote in an email, referring to lifestyle startups. ""What we really stress is that companies that could be great lifestyle businesses and probably won't be unicorns shouldn't try to become unicorns. They should build sound, revenue-generating businesses that can build great products at a high margin for a (relatively) small group of customers.""

In an irony that's not lost on its founder, Tacklebox itself is one such startup. ""I love that Tacklebox is practicing what it's preaching,"" Cheng said. He mentioned that Tacklebox has already gone through several iterations, holding workshops on weekends, mornings, and evenings, and offering higher and lower price points.""It's got to be scary for Brian,"" Cheng added, ""but I commend him for that and for not being afraid of trying new things and experimenting.""","Keep your day job, move slowly, and don't worry about building a unicorn: A New York 'startup school' eschews everything Silicon Valley ever taught us","963093302","2018-10-06","https://www.businessinsider.in/keep-your-day-job-move-slowly-and-dont-worry-about-building-a-unicorn-a-new-york-startup-school-eschews-everything-silicon-valley-ever-taught-us/articleshow/66101425.cms","businessinsider.in",FALSE
"5033","","9 years on, Govt fails to construct school building at Pulwama's Banjren

Nine years on, School Education Department, Kashmir, has failed to construct building for much awaited Primary School in kandi village of South Kashmir's Pulwama district.

Local residents from Banjren, a Gujjar habitation -- around 35 kilometres from district headquarter, informed that in 2009 authorities of school education department established a primary school in their village.

""During the initial phase, government primary school Banjren was accommodated in a rented building and it operated in a dilapidated building sans any ventilation from July 2009,"" Tufail Ahmad , a local from the area said, adding villagers from Banjren pleaded before authorities for constructing a building for the school.

He said that in 2011 when the rented building started collapsing that authorities of school education department approved construction of two additional class rooms(ACR) for government primary school Banjren.

Another resident, Sheeraz Ahmad, said that the contract for construction of ACR was given to a local contractor, Riyaz Ahmad. However Ahmad refused to start construction on ACR on grounds that he saw the contract as less profit making to him. Sheeraz said that he handed over the contract to another contractor, Zubair Ahmad who after construction of plinth too refused to work on the project fearing loss.

The villagers informed that after 2014 great deluge, the walls of the rented building from which primary school Banjren was operating started falling apart.

They said that fearing any causality, the authorities clubbed this primary school with another primary school, which is situated at distance of five kilometres in Kandi-Pathri village.

The villagers said that clubbing of primary school Banjren proved counter-productive as student roll declined from 70 to 16 from 2015 to 2018.

""Most students discharged themselves to get enrolled in nearby private schools,"" teachers at the school said, adding that travelling 5 kilometre long distance through dirt paths is troublesome for primary school kids.

The villagers added that in 2015 a new primary school was constructed in Banjren habitation for students of Poswal Mohalla.

""We request authorities of school education department either started constructed on primary school Banjren, which is pending since 2011 or club it with primary school Poswal Mohalla, which will save our children from travelling 5 kilometres up-hill,"" the villagers said.

Chief Education Officer, Pulwama, Mushtaq Ahmad Salroo told Rising Kashmir that construction on primary school Banjren was stopped because it was being built in landslide prone area. He said that they would consider clubbing of primary school Banjren with primary school Poswal Mohalla.","9 years on, Govt fails to construct school building at Pulwama's Banjren","960732385","2018-10-03","http://risingkashmir.com/news/9-years-on-govt-fails-to-construct-school-building-at-pulwamas-banjren","RisingKashmir",FALSE

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building in question had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty to educate them.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school.","When will students be shifted from 99-year-old dilapidated school building: HC asks AAP govt","952828700","2018-09-23","https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/when-will-students-be-shifted-from-99-year-old-dilapidated-school-building-hc-asks-aap-govt-118092300217_1.html","Business Standard",FALSE

"5042","","Dilapidated school building at Wakherwan risks lives of students

The Department Of School Education Kashmir is risking lives of students of Government Boys Primary School at Wakherwan in South Kashmir's Pulwama district by conducting their classes in an unsafe and unhygienic building.

The Primary school at Wakherwan village is housed in a three room single storey building.

Ghulam Mohammad Mir, a villager said that the building was constructed in 1980s and over these years it started dilapidating due to lack of maintenance by concerned authorities.

""The walls of the building have wide cracks, windows are broken and without window panes. The ceiling too is broken,"" he said.

""Our village has more than 200 households and has a decent population of school going children but majority of parents have stopped sending their kids to the school,"" Mir said, adding that the building is unsafe and can collapse anytime. He said that around 25 students, mostly from poor families who cannot afford to send their kids to private schools, are enrolled in the said institution.

The villagers said that the school environment is unhygenic. "" A stable can be seen sharing walls with the school building on one side and on other side there is a cowshed; heaps of cow dung, dirt and fallen tree trunks fill the small yard of the school,"" the villagers said.

Another villager, Mohammad Ashraf said that the floor of the class rooms often become dirty after bird poop falls on to them from the attic through wide holes of the broken ceiling.

""Neat and clean environment is a pre-requisite for an institution like a primary school because teachers often start educating tender kids on cleanliness,"" he said , adding that authorities put a bad example before their kids . He said that unhygienic school environment serves as a source of infection and the stink causes distraction in regular class work.

The villagers said that they pleaded with authorities for relocation of the school but to no avail. ""There are more than 800 kanals of state land (chariae) in our village which can be used for the purpose of constructing of the school,"" the villagers said.

Deputy Commissioner Pulwama, Ghulam Mohammad Dar said that he held a meeting with villagers of the residents who informed him about the available land.

""A new building will be constructed at the available land which is very suitable for the said purpose and the school will be relocated to the new building,"" he said.","Dilapidated school building at Wakherwan risks lives of students ","945269089","2018-09-12","http://risingkashmir.com/news/dilapidated-school-building-at-wakherwan-risks-lives-of-students-","RisingKashmir",FALSE

In an attempt to provide enhanced quality education in a more conducive learning environment, the district administration in Rajouri of Jammu and Kashmir completed the construction of two government school buildings.

"5046","","A public sector enterprise, NBCC had adopted the monument for upgradation and facelift under the Centre's Adopt a Heritage scheme last year, a Ministry of Culture official said. The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

A slice of 'modern history' in the capital may have been permanently erased by authorities, with the demolition of a part of the old school building on the Purana Qila premises. The demolition, carried out around 10 days ago, is part of an extensive facelift exercise being undertaken inside the complex by the Archaeological Survey of India, in collaboration with the National Buildings Construction Company.

A public sector enterprise, NBCC had adopted the monument for upgradation and facelift under the Centre's Adopt a Heritage scheme last year, a Ministry of Culture official said. The Rs 27 crore facelift project started a few months ago, with an October deadline.

In June, amid reports about the possible demolition of the Partition-era school building, several archaeologists and heritage experts raised a voice against the move. Former ASI director general BB Lal said, ""The building was built after Partition, when refugees came to Purana Qila, as a school for their children. Even if it's not Mughal or British, the structure has its own importance in modern history.""

Neera Misra, chairperson-trustee of the Delhi-based Draupadi Dream Trust, which promotes arts and culture, sent letters to the ASI, Ministry of Culture and PMO, asking them to intervene and stop the demolition of the ""1947 Partition history-linked building"". Misra said, ""I was assured at the time that the demolition will not happen.""

Even though ASI officials were unavailable for comment, when The Indian Express had contacted them in June, ASI had said in a written reply: ""The earliest reference to imparting education to children of those who migrated to India after Partition relates to the... corridors and gardens of Quila-e-Kuhna mosque inside Purana Qila from August 1948 to December 1949. The said school was just a temporary arrangement for some time after 1949...""

An ASI archaeologist, who did not wish to be named, said, ""The said building was not blocking the view of the fort, nor was it jarring in any other way. The ASI will demolish a building only if it's an encroachment in the protected area or entails any illegal occupation. This wasn't the case here.""

Meanwhile, the National Green Tribunal sought a report from NBCC on the revival of the iconic lake, after a plea alleged the project was being undertaken in a manner that would damage the environment. A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed NBCC to submit the report by September 24, when the matter would be heard next.

The direction came on a plea filed by Delhi-based R K Gupta, who contended that both the NBCC and ASI have put a plastic sheet on the bed of the lake, preventing groundwater recharge.

Also, the use of a JCB machine near the main entrance of the fort by NBCC had raised eyebrows. Experts contend that earth-moving equipment can't be deployed in or close to heritage structures as it may damage them. The ASI said in the statement: ""The elevated road leading to the main entrance of Purana Qila has been made of several layers of concrete in recent times. Removing those layers manually would have taken a lot of time; so we had to employ the equipment.""

""In the ASI guidelines, it's not mentioned whether we can or cannot use the JCB. It has to be decided on site, as per the circumstances,"" said an official, adding that ""a British-era pathway has been revealed at the entrance after the removal of the concrete road, and it will be retained as it is"".

"5047","","NEW DELHI: An alarmed Delhi high court on Thursday ordered the Delhi government to demolish an entire building of a government-aided school in northeast Delhi's Karawal Nagar, after ensuring that all children are evacuated.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao gave the direction to raze the building of Alok Punj Secondary School and to transfer all students to other government schools after the Delhi government informed the court that on inspection, Central Public Works Department (CPWD) had found the structure to be dangerous and vulnerable to collapse anytime.

In his report, the chief engineer of CPWD intimated the court that the building was unsafe. During the brief hearing, HC made it clear to the government that it is only concerned with the condition of the building and the safety of children studying there.

""We are only permitting you to shift the students and construct a new building there,"" the bench noted. The court then asked the Directorate of Education (DoE) to file, in a week's time, a status report indicating the timeframe by which the students would be shifted to another school and a new building be constructed for them to study.

On its part, Delhi government assured the high court that it will provide free bus services to students and accommodate them to other nearby schools run by it.

The high court's direction came while hearing a PIL, filed by NGO Social Jurist through advocate Ashok Agarwal, highlighting that 2,600 students enrolled in classes VI - X are studying in a dangerous school building and the government needs to shift them temporarily so that it can rebuild a new building, which is much safer.

The court had earlier directed the secretary of education to personally look into the matter as the same concerned safety, security and education of the students.

"5051","","Kerala floods have claimed over 400 lives, left a million others in relief camps, not only this the deadly floods managed to wash away over 10,000km of highways and roads along with hundreds of bridges. People in Kerala might not be able to forget the 'deadly months' of July and August because of the massive effect of the calamity on life and infrastructure.

Help has been pouring in from all over the country for those who have been hit by the flood. Despite fewer resources, Keralites have come together to help each other.

This government lower primary school at Kurichiarmala in the district will remain the testimony to nature's fury that has left a trail of death and destruction across the state.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire Mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to an upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity.","Madrassa In Flood-Hit Kerala Makes Sure That Government School Works From Its Building","935457420","2018-08-30","https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/madrassa-in-flood-hit-kerala-makes-sure-that-government-school-works-from-its-building-352129.html","indiatimes.com",FALSE

It all began when Dilip Kumar Saha, his girlfriend and their parents were summoned by the school on Monday, a day after Raksha Bandhan.

For whatever reasons, the principal and some teachers of the private school demanded at this meeting that the girl tie a rakhi on Dilip's wrist to mark their relationship as that of a brother and sister's.

Despite being forced, both the teenagers refused to do so. Things, however, did not stop there.

Police say that after this, Dilip headed to the second floor of the school building and jumped off it.

Dilip is said to have survived the fall, but is currently in a critical condition.

The incident has triggered a massive protest at the school, where students and guardians are demanding the arrest of the guilty teachers.

The cricket ground situated adjacent to Model Higher Secondary School at Zirpara Bijbehara is maintained by the locals since years and has produced top class cricketers like Parvez Rasool and Abdul Qayoom Bagha, former first-class cricketer, for past several decades.

The administration of Model Higher Secondary School, according to locals, is now trying to take over the portion of the ground by constructing a 6-room structure despite having an ample space and existing structures.

A veteran local cricketer, Ghulam Mohi Uddin Mirab who is the member of of Bijbehara Cricket Organisation, said they apprehend that structure, if constructed, would shrink the space for the cricket ground.

The residents and sports lovers say that in the absence of a proper sports ground, the youth of the area will have no option to develop their skills and may turn to waywardness.

Another cricketer Mohammad Shafi said the youth have developed keen interest towards sports activities for past many years owing to the availability of the playfield.

""This ground has produced hundreds of top cricketers in the region who have even played in national tournaments. Many landed good jobs due to their excellence in the sporting field too. If the authorities now snatch the ground from players it would halt the sporting activities afterwards.""

""The structure doesn't encroach upon the playfield. I have personally visited the site,"" he said.

He furthers said the land belongs to the higher secondary school and the sporting events are allowed only after a prior permission from the school principal.

""We are going ahead with the construction.

""Teachers moved all the students from six classrooms into a new building and crammed them into three rooms. But that building is also leaking,"" said Murugesan, father of a six-year-old.

As per the reports, the injured are fine and undergoing treatment in KEM Hospital. However, keeping in mind the intensity of the fire, it is really a miracle too see so many people survived. Meanwhile, as the fire-tenders were trying to rescue the residents trapped in fire, a 10-year-old girl saved the day with the lessons she had recently learnt in her school. The girl is grade 6 student.

The 10-year-old Zen Gunratan Sadvarte learnt a lesson from her school teacher who told her dos and don'ts when you are stuck in fire. Zen was quoted by NDTV as saying she was sleeping at the time and it is her mother who spotted the smoke and alerted the family. ""There was blasts burning and just gasses gathering over the house and the room. We couldn't breathe, I couldn't breathe so we went into the kitchen. My father thought that the kitchen would be much safer than anything,"" she said.

In the middle of chaos, Zen used her fire safety tips to help to save her family and neighbours. She asked them not to panic and asked them to cover their nose with a wet cloth to prevent form getting suffocated. Neighbours then rushed out of their flats and one girl was out of breath because of asthma.

""In asthma, you can't breathe well, the carbon was hurtful for her. I gathered everyone at the gallery of 1603.""

When the firefighters asked people to come down, the Class 6 student told them it was not a good idea. ""I took the phone and said we cannot come down as it will create a lot of panic and panic won't allow us to breathe,"" Zen told reporters.

Zen said she had done much research into disaster management when she was all of seven. ""I researched in grade 3 because you are judged over one topic. And I took disaster management. I don't know whether my data is saved right now or not but..."" The knowledge certainly helped when she needed it the most.

"5059","","Rustam Oraon, a Class 10 visually impaired student, had a narrow escape as a portion of the roof of his hostel room fell just beside him. The incident took place at the Government Senior Secondary School for Boys (Blind) hostel in north Delhi's Kingsway Camp on August 8 after heavy rain in the national capital. This incident has occurred after a PIL on the condition of the building and the requirement of teaching staff was filed in the Delhi High Court earlier this month.

""Portions of two roofs had fallen on the same day in room numbers 7 and 13. I was saved as it fell besides me and just broke my fingernail. The other boys were at the other end of the room. My parents were glad it did not fall on my head,"" said Oraon, showing the wound.

After the incident, students received a letter from Delhi social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam saying things will be fixed soon.

The roofs have now been temporarily patched up with cement. The railings to the staircases are rusting while the wall paint has come off at most places.

According to hostel residents, the school building was identified as 'dangerous' by the Public Works Department some years ago, but no precautionary measures were taken.

""It was only after a petition was filed that some repair work began, "" said SK Rungta, senior advocate who filed the plea and general secretary, National Federation of the Blind.

Around Rs 98 lakh were sanctioned for the repair work of the building in December 2017. Work was to start in May. However, work has started only now after the incident.

However, this is not the only worrisome fact about the place run by the Delhi government's social welfare department. The school and hostel for the blind from Class 1 to 12, housed in a two-storey building, also lacks teaching staff, books and, most importantly, audio devices.

With only 10 teachers for a total of 136 students, the classes are held with students stuffed in a room. Of the 10, only four teachers are regular employees while the rest are guest teachers. The sanctioned strength is 25 teachers. For the last 6-7 years, there has been no recruitment to fill the vacant posts said a school official.

""There is only one teacher for primary classes (Class 1-5). There are no teachers for science and maths, which is taught here up to Class 8,"" said RP Yadav, who teaches senior classes.

Vijay Rahul, a Class 12 student, said, ""there are no teachers for most subjects. How can a Hindi teacher teach mathematics?"" said Rahul.

The school has been running without a principal for more than two years. A new principal, a PGT teacher, has been given the and has joined only on August 18.

""We had asked engineers to assess the structure and start repair work. Also,I have been writing for a year to the DSSSB for recruitment of teachers. Meanwhile, we have arranged for guest teachers.

"5060","","Published: August 15, 2018 2:05:21 pm Unlike other days, when classes were held separately for all classes, on Tuesday, the children were cramped up under one roof

Classes for around 200 children of primary section (Classes I to V) of a government school in Jahangirpur (alias Jagirpur) had to be shifted to a langar hall in a nearby gurdwara after their building was declared 'unsafe' on August 10. The school also has around 15 children under pre-primary section.

Unlike other days, when classes were held separately for all classes, on Tuesday, the children were cramped up under one roof in the gurdwara as classes were held simultaneously.

The order issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office on August 10, asked the teachers of the school to shift classes to a 'safe' place and lock six 'unsafe' rooms as they collapse anytime. The order further stated that children should not be allowed to sit in the school building and that the head teacher should make some alternative arrangement for the classes to be conducted. As no proper place was found, children were made to sit in the langar hall of a gurudwara after getting the permission of the gurdwara head.

According to Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, it is just the beginning of many problems lying ahead. ""We have not even shifted our benches here because it is all uncertain. Gurudwara management can ask to vacate their space in the langar hall anytime, depending on their programmes. For instance, even on Monday we weren't able to conduct classes as there was a bhog ceremony scheduled at the gurdwara. So we made students sit in open at the porch of our school building,"" he said.

Since there were no fans at the gurudwara shed where students have been allotted space, old ceiling fans from the school building have been taken down and have been installed at the shed for now. ""We have got our own fans removed from the classrooms and got them installed here under the shed. How can we make students sit without fans in such heat? If any kid falls ill or gets unconscious, who will be responsible. Thankfully, there is a water cooler in the gurdwara, so drinking water is not an issue,"" added Singh.

Another problem that remains is that of the washroom. ""These are small children from Classes 1 to 5 and since our school building is across the main road, I cannot allow them to cross the road and go to washroom in our own school. It is a busy road with heavy traffic movement. So we are requesting the gurudwara management to let our children use their washrooms. We have agreed to pay to get them cleaned,"" he said.

While the written orders have been issued by district project director of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) from local district education office saying that old building having six classrooms should be locked and demolished as soon as possible, there is still no word on when and where new building will be constructed.

""Either they can demolish the old one and construct a new one here itself. Otherwise, village panchayat has told us that another chunk of land allotted for school many years back is lying unused. We have received no information yet on when work will start to construct the new building,"" said the head teacher.

Chennai-based Concrete Quality Concepts, an IIT-Madras-incubated company, which had conducted tests to assess the stability of the Government Higher Secondary School at Thinaikulam in the district, has said the 'stability of the building is good' but found some of the RC columns 'severely distressed.'

In its report submitted before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court, the company, which carried out ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV), rebound hammer (RH), assessment of carbonation, compressive cell and half cell potential tests in February, said the concrete in the near surface portion was in the range of 'good to very good'.

""The average RH values in RC structural elements of the school building indicate that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion is good to very good, except the RC columns C8 and C10 on the ground floor and C6 on the second floor,"" it said.

The average RH values in these RC columns indicated that the quality of concrete in the near surface portion was satisfactory. The average UPV values in a majority of the structural elements could be considered as good and in certain RC columns doubtful, the report said.

The visual inspection and non-destructive tests revealed that the corrosion was predominant in the RC columns of the ground floor and RC lintel beams of the first and the second floors. ""However, the RC beams and RC slab on all the three floors did not show any distress bearing in RC beam A8 and B8 in the second floor,"" it said.

The severely distressed RC columns on all the three floors should be rehabilitated using micro concrete jacketing, the company suggested. The tile joints in the terrace might be rectified to arrest the leakage with lime grout and repainting, it said.

After the court suo motu took cognisance of media reports that the school building was unsafe for students, the Engineer-in-chief (Buildings) of Public Works Department had ordered the tests.

"5069","","The Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE), in an affidavit, proposed that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) should construct a new building on the land to run an aided school or it may hand over the complete possession of the land to the department for construction of a new school building.

The affidavit was filed in a pending petition by NGO Social Jurist in which it was alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School in Delhi Cantonment, taken over by the Delhi government since 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from the state government, was in a horrible condition.

""Since the building is dilapidated and unsafe for the children, as a measure of abundant caution, the students of the school may be shifted or adjusted to nearby schools with the consent of the parents,"" it said.

The matter is scheduled to come up for hearing tomorrow before a bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon.

The DoE said that in pursuance to the court's July 13 direction, joint inspections were carried out by the senior officials of Ministry of Defence, DoE and others on July 23 and 25.

It said that after the joint inspections, Garrison engineer of MoD highlighted that the school building was constructed in 1919 and it has outlived its useful life and is unsuitable for habitation from the next on completion of 100 years.

Due to the condition of the building, no major repair or alteration is recommended to the building owing to safety issue. Even the building is not compliant with latest codal provisions laid down for school, architecturally and structurally, by the Bureau of Indian Standards. Hence, functioning of the school from the current building is no recommended, it said.

The DoE said the military engineer services takes the rent for the school building including the water and electricity charges from it for running the school.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty to educate them.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

Water seeping through cracked ceilings and walls during rain, broken window panes and roots of old trees peeping out of damaged walls -- this is the scenario inside the government primary school at Jahangirpur village of Ludhiana. However, the education department and Public Works Department (PWD) is unmoved, despite the probability that the school building can collapse anytime, putting lives of around 200 children at risk. It is yet to declare the building unsafe as heavy rainfall has made the condition worse and students have to adjust in four classrooms. The walls, windows and ceiling of the entire building have become very weak.

Since the departments do not have any alternative, they are not declaring classrooms unsafe, putting the lives of more than 200 children at stake, said Manmohan Singh, head teacher of the school, who has written at least four letters in the past week, stating that due to heavy rain, the school building, which is already in a very bad shape, can collapse anytime. So, it should be declared unsafe at the earliest so that they can move kids out, but there has been no action till Saturday.

Singh, who has written to the block primary education officer, local MLA Sanjay Talwar and local PWD officials, said the school has more than 200 kids. ""There are four classrooms and all of them are unsafe. Despite our several letters to various departments, the PWD is not declaring the building unsafe and lives of children are being put at stake,"" he said.

Kuldeep Saini, Deputy District Education Officer, said a report from the PWD engineers is awaited to declare the building unsafe. ""We are looking for some other arrangement, till a new building is constructed. Meanwhile, teachers can hold classes in the local gurdwara,"" he said.

Unofficially, the head teacher has been asked to look for space and even contact local gurdwara.

""They (government) have no other space and we have been told to move to nearby gurdwara, but through unofficial verbal orders. A major tragedy is awaiting.

The students of a government school in Chhattisgarh's Jagima village are studying under a tree in an open field as they have no school building. The construction of the building has been stopped as the state government and some villagers are fighting over the land on which the school was supposed to come up, stated a report by news agency ANI.

Since the authorities have failed to resolve the land dispute, children have no school building and their classes are taking place under a tree.

The ANI report added that if it rains heavily then the students of the school either go to a nearby Anganwadi to take shelter or their classes get cancelled. This way the students lose a lot of their study hours in the school as most often weather plays a spoilsport.

On Friday, OneIndia wrote about leaking roofs of a Madhya Pradesh school. In fact, tired by the lackadaisical attitude of the authorities to fix the leaking roofs of their school building, students of the government school in Dindori, Madhya Pradesh on Thursday submitted a memorandum to the district council. Their memorandum was addressed to President Ramnath Kovind.

""During monsoon, water drips from the roof in every classroom. There are no washrooms and it has been like this for many years, please help us,"" stated the memorandum addressed to the President.

Be it Chhattisgarh or Madhya Pradesh, school education, mostly in rural areas, is in shambles.

In the absence of a permanent school building for the past three years, these students and their three teachers have to make do with rooms provided by individuals.

In 2015, owing to the dilapidated condition of the government-run school building, officers from the education department closed it down keeping in mind students' safety. But in three years they could not start work on a new building. Since then, students were forced to attend classes in rooms provided by the villagers, one of whom got his house built under Indira Awas Yojana.

Jajati Kesari Suna, president of the school management committee said, ""We requested the house owner to allow us to use his room, but how long could we keep him waiting.""

So, after two years, the owner told them to vacate his home. ""We approached the officials requesting them to help us construct a new building, but all their assurances came to nought,"" Suna said.

Disappointed, the school management decided to shift to another house which had been newly constructed. But after holding classes there for a year, the owner has now asked them to vacate the place within the next two months.

""Where will these students study?"" asked Hara Prasad Shah, the school headmaster. ""Due to shortage of rooms, we shifted students from Classes VI to VIII to another school, which is four km away. Only students from I-V are studying here,"" Shah added.

Kalahandi district collector Anjan Kumar Manik said fund had been allocated for construction of a new school building two years back. ""I have instructed the officials to start the construction as soon as possible,"" Manik said.

Nila Madhab Panda, the block education officer of Kesinga, said Rs 6 lakh was allocated for the school but it could not be utilised in time because getting suitable land was a problem.

The court directed that the building be restored at the same place after it was informed that funds were demanded from State Project Director of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan for reconstruction of the school building.

A bench of Justices Vikram Nath and Rajesh Singh Chauhan passed the order on a PIL moved by one Rana Pratap Singh.

The petitioner alleged that the school was demolished to provide a large space to the parliamentarian in front of his house, in collusion with education authorities and the village pradhan.

The claim that the school building was demolished because it was dilapidated is not correct, the petitioner said.

"5081","","BHAWANIPATNA: A visit to the Trinath Temple near Bhawanipatna on any given day of the week is bound to throw up a strange sight - a group of students attending classes within the temple premises. This Shiva temple in Raisinghpur village is not just home to the deity, it has been serving as a school for 23 students for the past 10 years.

The Raisinghpur New Primary School, established in 2008, was to have been set up on a parcel of government land outside the village.

The school and mass education department, under which the school falls, had granted funds to the tune of Rs 6.44 lakh in 2008-2009. As the land was situated far away from Raisinghpur, the authorities decided to shift the school to within the village. A 20-decimal patch of land, also belonging to the government but claimed by the villagers as their own, was chosen for the school by the revenue inspector.

Due to the dispute over the land, the school building was never actually built. Thus, from its inception, the school - which has classes from I to V and comprises 23 students, three teachers and four blackboards - has been working out of its unlikely home from 10 am to 4 pm, six days a week.

""We come to the school regularly and it becomes difficult for the teachers to take classes as there is only one room in the temple here. Had there been a building, we would have read without any problem,"" said Prem Karuna, a Class V student.

Damayanti Barik, the mother of a Class V student, said the future of the children were at stake. ""The biggest problem the kids face is while eating the midday meal. The food has to be prepared in different houses in the village as the school does not have a building of its own. Not only is this a logistical nightmare, it also brings up the question of hygiene,"" she said.

The cook of Raisinghpur New Primary School, Kadambini Mishra, echoes Damayanti. ""It is so difficult to cook in a different house every day. Worse, the children have to eat under the open sky in the temple verandah,"" she said.

""We are trying to do the best we can under the circumstances,"" added headmaster in charge of the school, Pratap Kumar Panda.

The Kalahandi district project coordinator of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Gabakhya Nayak, said a new proposal for the construction of the school building at a cost of Rs 10 lakh had been sent to the government. ""However, construction can only begin when the dispute over land ends,"" he added.

President of the school management committee, Jatindra Singh, explained that the dispute over the 20-decimal land had led to the school building's construction being stalled.

On being asked, he could not specify when the dispute would be resolved. ""The revenue inspector had chosen the land. It is up to the state government to resolve the land issue,"" was all he was willing to say.","No school building, Kalahandi pupils attend class in temple - Times of India","902679583","2018-07-10","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/no-school-building-kalahandi-pupils-attend-class-in-temple/articleshow/64929565.cms","The Times of India",FALSE

The Class IX student lived with her parents in an adjacent building. Police said the girl was conscious after the fall and spoke to her mother. But investigators have not concluded the reason for the drastic step.

With two children ending their lives in as many months, the school intends to conduct suicide prevention programmes for parents and students. ""We held a session in May and are roping in experts this time too,"" a teacher told TOI.

The girl studied in the ICSE stream and was bright at academics. She was a prefect at school and was chosen for her good overall performance. Teachers said she had attended school on Thursday and nothing had happened which could have upset her. Around 2.30pm, the girl returned from school. She then left home on the pretext of going to tuitions, in the same complex. Instead, she headed to another building and went to the eighth-floor refuge area.

The housing complex's developer has built a wing for BMC Class 4 employees. But they are not permitted to use the front entrance and have access to their homes from a separate back entrance. A relative of one BMC staffer witnessed the suicide. ""I was at the window when I first saw this girl in the window of the refuge area around 4.30pm. I called out to my brothers and we alerted the gardener below. But he wouldn't pay heed to us,"" said Chetan Tiwari. ""As the girl climbed down and sat on the parapet, I was terrified. My brother whipped out his phone and started to shoot a video clip. We started screaming and the guards finally took us seriously. But it was too late by the time they could go upstairs,"" said Tiwari.

The clip was circulated on WhatsApp and soon went viral, leaving her friends and neighbours stunned.

""The refuge area cannot be kept locked nor can a wire mesh be put up as per fire department orders. We had put up CCTV cameras in the area which have captured the girl going to the parapet,"" said society manager Rajesh Medhe. ""A guard has been posted there since the incident.""

Residents informed the girl's mother and carried the girl into a car.

She succumbed to injuries at the hospital. ""She had celebrated her birthday eight to 10 days ago,"" her tuition teacher said. ""She was never stressed about studies and had smiled at me while leaving from tuitions on Wednesday.

A 28-year-old man was killed as a major fire charred two floors of a nursery school building in Girgaum on Sunday evening. A major tragedy was averted as the building, Kothare House, near Central Plaza, was vacant as it was Sunday, said Vishwas Mote, assistant commissioner of D ward, under whose jurisdiction this area falls.

Raunak Global Academy, the nursery school, was located in the building on the first to the third floor.

According to VP Road police station, the man who was killed has been identified as Khadir Alam. He was found by the fire brigade in an unconscious state on the third floor of the building. He was taken to a hospital, but was declared dead.

No other injuries were reported, but the fire brigade continued its search for any unidentified missing persons, late into the night.

The first floor of the building was undergoing renovation work. Mote said, ""There was carpentry work going on the first floor, and it is likely that the dead person was a worker.""

A Level II fire (not a major fire) gutted second and third floors of the four-storey building at 6.08pm on Sunday.

The fire turned into a Level III fire (major fire) by 6.30pm. The exact cause of the fire is not yet known, an official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said.

The fire brigade pressed eight fire engines and seven water tankers, a turntable ladder and an ambulance to the spot. The fire was brought under control after around three hours of fire fighting, by 9.43pm.

According to reports from the fire brigade, the building did not have the mandatory fire safety systems. P Rahangdale, chief fire officer, said, ""Like every other building in Mumbai, the problem we faced in this building was also of accessibility to the building. The lanes leading to it were narrow and parking fire tenders proved to be a major challenge.""","One dead as fire guts 2 floors of nursery school building in Mumbai ","893271473","2018-06-24","https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/one-dead-as-fire-guts-2-floors-of-nursery-school-building-in-mumbai/story-PJbsAdQoxsrti7Lh4bXPqI.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"5086","","London, Glasgow's world-renowned School of Art has been gutted by another huge blaze, four years after part of the building was destroyed by fire.

Flames ripped through the celebrated Mackintosh building after it caught fire at around 23:15 BST on Friday, a BBC News report said on Saturday.

The blaze has spread to nearby buildings, including the Campus nightclub and O2 ABC music venue, which suffered ""extensive damage"". No casualties have been reported, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said.

Efforts to bring the fires under control are expected to be ""prolonged"", Deputy Chief Officer Iain Bushell said.

More than 120 firefighters have been sent to the scene, faced with ""an extremely challenging and complex incident"", he said.

The Mackintosh building was badly damaged by fire in May 2014 and was due to re-open next year following a multi-million pound restoration project.

Ben, an eyewitness, told the BBC the latest fire looked ""much worse"" than the previous one. ""This is a blaze, the building is just going up like a tinder-box. It's quite shocking,"" he said.

Connor Neil, 22, said people were being evacuated from their homes and there was a ""big orange light"" which could be seen from streets away.Despite the thick, black, acrid smoke, the blaze seemed to be dying down in the Mackintosh building.But very quickly the situation changed, with the roof of Campus nightclub catching fully alight.

Earlier, loud bangs were heard coming from inside the art school as crews tried to tackle the flames.Students - some of whom graduated on Friday - were in the street in shock. They can't believe it's happened again.

One Twitter user posted a video of the O2's roof appearing to collapse as firefighters sprayed water onto the building from an aerial platform.

Police Scotland advised the public to avoid the area, and said areas around Dalhousie St, Scott St and Sauchiehall St were all affected by road closures.

Glasgow North East MP Paul Sweeney described the building, designed by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, as ""the most architecturally important building in Glasgow"".

The Labour politician said the restoration effort had suffered a ""horrific setback"" which he hoped would be overcome.

Mr Sweeney went on to say: ""The 1909 library extension, that was the origin of the 2014 blaze is now fully alight too. ""It looks like the entire interior space is now fully alight.

""The best we can probably hope for is structural facade retention and a complete rebuild of the interior. Devastating.""

In a tweet, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""This is clearly an extremely serious situation. ""My first thoughts tonight are for the safety of people - but my heart also breaks for Glasgow's beloved @GSofA.

""Once again, we are indebted to the bravery of our firefighters and other emergency services.""The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer.

It has been described as ""a working art school as well as a work of art"", and has an A-list rating from Historic Scotland.

In recent years, the school has produced many of the UK's leading contemporary artists such as Douglas Gordon, David Shrigley, and three recent Turner Prize winners: Simon Starling in 2005, Richard Wright in 2009 and Martin Boyce in 2011.Other former students include actors Robbie Coltrane and Peter Capaldi, and artist Peter Howson.

The fire in 2014, caused by a faulty projector, destroyed the building's library, which was recognised as being one of the finest examples of art nouveau in the world.","Glasgow fire: Art school's Mackintosh building ravaged","888410176","2018-06-16","http://www.centralchronicle.com/glasgow-fire-art-schools-mackintosh-building-ravaged.html","Central Chronicle",FALSE

Though 12 workers were present on the site, they escaped unscathed. A small portion of the restaurant adjacent to the heritage building was also damaged. The workers said the incident took place around 10.55 am while they were constructing a concrete lintel on the existing building, which, alleged locals, was being used by the school to conduct dance and music classes for students.

""I was working inside. The building tilted and a sound was heard following which I ran to safety to the ground nearby. I was lucky as a huge chunk of lintel collapsed in front of me. Had I reacted even a fraction of a second late, I would have died,"" said a carpenter, who did not wish to be named. Fire and Rescue Services workers soon rushed to the spot and deployed a dog squad to check whether any worker was stranded under the debris. However, the other workers later confirmed only 12 of them were working there and had made it out safely.

Unscientific methods alleged

Residents in the area alleged the renovation of the heritage building was being carried out in an unscientific manner and the school management had failed to get the proper sanction from the authorities concerned.

""The walls of the building were in a pathetic state and not in a position to bear the load of the huge concrete lintel. We had informed the school management about this, as one of the walls had developed a big hole. Moreover, the school authorities constructed the lintel without a pillar to support it,"" alleged Siyad, who runs the hotel adjacent to the collapsed building.

'Allegations baseless'

Refuting the allegations, Delta School authorities said the building, located 50 m away from the main school building, was never used for any other purpose.""Since it is a heritage building, we cannot demolish it. We had received the permission from the Archaeology Department and the local body to initiate renovation work.

"5093","","SHILLONG, May 24: Claiming that there has been a misuse of public funds in the construction of a school building in the city, the Khun Hyniewtrep National Awakening Movement (KHNAM) has demanded that the state government institutes an inquiry into the issue.

As per the president of the party's youth wing, Thomas Passah, a reply to a RTI filed by the party had revealed that Rs 75,000 was sanctioned as a non-recurring grant in aid for construction of school additional class room under the Non-Lapsable Central Pool of Resources scheme for Madrassa Himayatul Islam UP School Shillong.

While there is nothing wrong in this, Passah pointed out that one of the conditions in the guidelines issued was that the school should have undisputed and sufficient land for construction of the school building with scope for further expansion.

Passah also said that the SDSEO in its reply to the RTI on November 29, 2017 had informed that the school does not have a land patta of its own. Also, the DSEL in its reply on May 14, this year had further intimated that the building permission for the school is not available and the Tax Receipt copy of the land is also not available.

Passah also said that the guidelines specify that the School Managing Committee (SMC) shall be responsible for maintenance and repairs of the building putting proper boundary fencing and up keep of the building on completion.

Passah however said that if the school does not have land, it is impossible to be responsible for maintenance and repairs and provision of boundary fencing.

""Based on the facts received through RTI, it can be concluded that there has been a misuse of public money, and possibility that the amount sanctioned for construction of the school building was not utilized at all. Various appeals and complaints have been made to the DSEO and DSEL, but no action has been taken till date,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Passah further alleged that the Managing Committee of the school, which was approved by the SDSEO, Shillong, consists of members whose qualification is below matric (tenth) with members having minimum qualification of class III.

""There are also criminal charges against few a members of the Managing Committee. It is saddening to know that the authority approved and entrust the management of school business to people whose qualification is very low besides having criminal charges,"" he stated.

Passah has since sought the intervention of the State Education Minister, Lahkmen Rymbui through a memorandum in which he said that it is not about the size of the amount, but the seriousness of the crime, which needs to be eradicated from the state especially from reputed and important sector as education.","KHNAM questions construction of school building","874209344","2018-05-24","http://meghalayatimes.info/index.php/front-page/42397-demands-inquiry-while-alleging-misuse-of-public-funds","Meghalaya Times",FALSE

This comes a day after a Class-VI girl was allegedly raped by the pooled car driver and cleaner. The cops have also demanded details of all the cars and buses ferrying students.

""We have asked all schools to provide us with detailed lists of cars and buses ferrying students. We are preparing advisory for operators, schools, students and their parents.

In Kolkata, the police are supposed to carry out background check of pooled car and school bus crews and bar vehicles that don't meet basic fitness measures from ferrying kids. The instructions issued about six months ago after consultations with transport department state only drivers and helpers whose antecedents have been verified should take the driver's seat. As a thumb rule, rickety vehicles and drivers without a valid licence were not allowed to ferry students. ""While CCTV cameras in the vehicles should be ideal, we want the pooled car association to start a GPS tracking system, especially in cars for lower-primary students,"" said an officer.

This comes days after a three-year-old girl was allegedly molested in a school bus by the driver and conductor in Nainital's Kathgodam area. The duo was arrested on Friday evening.

A division bench of acting chief justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma gave a slew of directions to the public schools for maintaining a safe environment for the students. The orders came while disposing of a writ petition filed by Aklema Parveen highlighting the 'insensitivity' on the part of the school while dealing with the victim.

The court said that the incidents of molestation are reported frequently and the state administration should have taken necessary remedial steps to address the issue by now.

The division bench further directed schools to make it mandatory for the school buses and vans to have female staff in them.

""Schools must provide their students with GPS enabled identification cards to trace their location. Not just ID cards, but buses and vans should also be quipped with GPS tracker systems,"" the bench said.

Besides, to enhance the safety of students within and outside the premises of the schools, parents should be informed through SMS after picking up and dropping off their children, the court said.

Uttarakhand is known for its renowned public schools located across Nainital, Mussoorie and Dehradun. However, the reputed schools have often failed to maintain security for the students.

Recently, six people, including the staff, from one of Dehradun's well-known schools were arrested for covering up an incident of gang rape of a teenager.

The High Court underlined that the district authorities shall regularly monitor the CCTV footage in private schools and the school management must abide by its directives, otherwise, the court shall recommend cancellation of affiliation of the errant schools.","Install CCTV Cameras in School Vehicles or Affiliation Will be Cancelled: Uttarakhand HC","954607602","2018-09-25","https://www.news18.com/news/india/install-cctv-cameras-in-school-vehicles-or-affiliation-will-be-cancelled-uttarakhand-hc-1889065.html","News18",FALSE
"5192","","The Wanowrie police have recovered close circuit television (CCTV) footage in the sexual abuse case of a 14-year-old student by the school principal of prominent English medium school in Fatimanagar. According to the complaint, a pornographic video was shown to the victim after which he was sexually abused by the principal in his chamber.

Investigating officer Girija Mehetre said, ""We have obtained CCTV footage from the school which has evidentiary value to nail the accused in the crime committed. The investigation is on and I cannot comment much as it is a very sensitive case.""

Former corporator Maruti Bhapkar and social activist Dominic Lobo have demanded that the head of the institution/ trust in the case must also be booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) . The head of the institute was bound to inform the police about the heinous act, which he did not do in this case, they alleged during a media conference. They also issued a detailed release in the case stating that the police was under a lot of pressure from powerful sections of the society. The duo has petitioned the highest levels in the government demanding strict action against all those who were shielding the culprits.

The police said that principal, who is also a priest, was involved in a similar case in the past. The Catholic church authorities had then put the suspect under three years of ""house detainment"" at the time, investigating officials told the Pune court, seeking custody of the principal.

According to the police, the accused principal was on his way to Ahmedabad when he was arrested from Mumbai on Wednesday, for allegedly sexually abusing a Class 9 student and showing the student a pornographic video.

According to the complaint, it was on March 10 that the accused serving as principal in the Pune school, first abused the student in his chamber. On March 12, the principal then allegedly showed him a pornographic video clip. This was in the rest-room when the student was alone.","Child sexual abuse: Pune police obtain  CCTV footage, say it has 'evidentiary value' against school principal","954349303","2018-09-25","https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/child-sexual-abuse-pune-police-obtain-cctv-footage-say-it-has-evidentiary-value-against-school-principal/story-NQhOqvIVhqYPEZXAWkNxjJ.html","Hindustan Times",FALSE
"5194","","Written by Sukrita Baruah | New Delhi | Published: August 9, 2018 2:24:39 am Weeks after 'sexual assault', probe panel flags CCTV gaps at Greater Noida school Letter from Uttarakhand: Confiscate baseball bats from kanwarias, keep eye out for drugsDelhi: Day after kanwaria rampage in police presence, few leads, FIR without namesDelhi: 109 malaria, 56 dengue cases reported this season

Close to a month after a three-year-old child was allegedly sexually assaulted in a prominent Greater Noida school, the panel which conducted a magisterial enquiry of the school premises has pointed to gaps in the CCTV system, and stated that CBSE's safety instructions are not being followed completely. It has also drawn a list of 12 suggestions to improve security at the school.

On July 14, a helper at the school's swimming pool was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a nursery student, following which the District Magistrate formed a committee to look into whether the school followed standard safety procedures.

The panel has reported that there is only one CCTV camera in the vicinity of the swimming pool, and it points towards the pool and not the entry to changing rooms. It also pointed out that certain parts of the school are not covered by cameras, and the school lacks a system for monitoring the feed.

According to the report, there are four screens in the principal's office which can switch between footage from four cameras, while the designated monitoring office has only one screen which can display footage from one camera. The report states this is sufficient for random checks but not for continuous monitoring.

It also stated that the school does not have a formal record of its outsourced staff members and that it has not appointed a security or vigilance officer.

Suggestions by the committee include: the school should have dedicated staff to monitor CCTV feed; only female staff should be present in places like toilets and swimming pool; every staff member should have police verification; clear and honest communication between the school management and guardians is necessary.

"5196","","FIR filed against unidentified individuals under POCSO sections

A two-year old boy allegedly suffered sexual assault in a south Kolkata school on Monday, and his father suspects its management deleted CCTV footage that could shed light on what happened.

IndiaToday.in accessed copies of the man's written complaint, the boy's patient card, and the first investigation report - which lists sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act, 2012. The FIR was filed against unidentified individuals.

The boys's father says his wife found him ""crying very badly"" when she went to bring him home from school on Monday. When she discovered, later, that his ""internal parts [were] bleeding"", they sought medical opinion.

""After that night, we visited his doctor, and he mentioned that someone inserted some object in his private part, and his rectum is swollen,"" the father recalls in his complaint. On July 4, he says, another doctor -- a child specialist -- confirmed ""the abnormal behaviour"", and was ""shocked"" and ""stunned"".

According to the complaint, when the boy's parents asked the school's principal for CCTV footage, she told them the equipment hadn't been working properly since June 26.

She said the school didn't have footage from the time period between June 26 and July 2 (Monday), and ""also mentioned that nothing has happened in the school"", the father says.

And when he signed his name, he added the words: ""A helpless father"".

"5197","","Written by Milind Ghatwai | Mandsaur | Published: July 3, 2018 3:55:22 am The family alleged that the girl's school did not want to bring police in the picture.

On June 26, the family and relatives of the seven-year-old rape and assault victim in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, had looked at all possible places she could have gone after school - and even alerted relatives in nearby villages and towns to look for a schoolgirl in uniform - before they approached the police around 8.30 pm to file a missing person's complaint. The family alleged that the girl's school did not want to bring police in the picture.

While the two main accused were arrested the following day, and reportedly confessed to the crime, the police said the family informed them late, which may have affected the search for the girl.

Superintendent of Police (City) Rakesh Shukla, who is leading the special investigation team (SIT) in the case, said police were informed at least an hour-and-a-half late. He said the school could not provide CCTV footage so the police sought footage from shops and houses in three lanes leading to the school.

Kotwali Police Station in-charge J S Yadav also accused the family of reaching the police late. He claimed the police swung into action immediately, beginning by searching the school's washrooms and storerooms to see whether she had fallen asleep. The police checked deras of the Banchhada community, which has traditionally practised prostitution, by alerting police stations and shared her picture with gram raksha samitis (village committees).

Yadav said the police had even passed by the spot, off Laxman Darwaja Road in Mandsaur, where the victim was eventually found around noon on Thursday - raped, her throat slit, and left to die.

Doctors said her condition is fast improving -- she has started eating semi-solid food and walked a few steps on Monday. Dr V S Pal, superintendent of Indore's M Y Hospital, where she is recuperating, told the media that she could soon be moved out of ICU.

Her family said they did not approach the police because they did not imagine anything untoward initially. Her grandmother, who was late in fetching her from school on June 26, said, ""In case I got late she used to wait for me on the bench. When she was not there (that day), I thought someone else -- probably her father or a cousin -- had taken her home.""

But as they failed to trace her, soon nearly 25 or 30 members of the extended family were involved in the search, a cousin said.

""We even checked the last train, and were in touch with acquaintances in Sitamau, Neemuch and Pratapgarh (in neighbouring Rajasthan) through the night... nothing helped,"" the victim's uncle said. He said they could have traced her ""much before if the school's CCTV was working"".

The footage that led to Irfan's arrest on June 27 was sourced only after 2.30 pm, more than two hours after a boy had found the victim walking, dazed. This boy brought her to the road when a man passing by noticed them, and two policemen who were nearby reached them, officers said.

The police learned about the possible suspect through informers. Irfan was taken into custody late that night. Shukla said Irfan was wearing the same shoes as seen on the CCTV footage.

Although the police had also taken Asif, 24, into custody early on June 27, the arrest was made official only on Saturday. The SIT chief said both accused have confessed to the crime.","Mandsaur rape-assault case: School CCTV not working, footage sourced from elsewhere to crack case","898181852","2018-07-02","https://indianexpress.com/article/india/mandsaur-rape-assault-case-school-cctv-not-working-footage-sourced-from-elsewhere-to-crack-case-5243281/","The Indian Express",FALSE

"5200","","New Delhi: HighlightsFamily says classmates killed Tushar Kumar who had injury marks on body School claims the class 9 student was unwell and died in the hospital 3 detained after camera footage showed him being punched by classmates A Class 9 student who died after being found unconscious in the toilet of a Delhi school was murdered by his classmates, his family has alleged. Three students have been detained after security camera footage showed Tushar Kumar, 16, being punched by his classmates in the washroom in what the police described as a ""dadagiri-type"" fight on Thursday morning.

""The boys had a fight of sorts. They were in the same class and the fight that started in the classroom went on outside. Dadagiri type ka jhagda hua,"" said a police officer.

Tushar was taken to hospital after being found unconscious in the toilet by some students.

The school claims that he had been unwell and died in hospital, but his parents allege that there was a cover-up. ""If he was unwell, why would I send him to school? My son was cold when I touched him. The principal told us he had a stomach ache. He was dead in school,"" said his mother, surrounded by mourners from the family and neighbourhood.

""Bring back my son, they killed my son,"" she wept.

Tushar's parents allege that he was chased and beaten up by the three students and left to die in the washroom. And later, they say, the school tried to shield those involved.

There were no injury marks on Tushar's body, say the police as they wait for a post-mortem to establish how he died. Classmates and students who found him in the toilet have been questioned.

Tushar's family lives in Karawal Nagar in northeast Delhi, not far from his school in the same area. Yesterday, the boy's family members and residents came out on the streets in anger and shouted slogans outside the school, demanding an investigation into his death.

The case has chilling parallels to the murder of Pradyuman Thakur, a Class 2 student of Ryan International School in Gurgaon, who was found with his throat slit in a school toilet in September. The police believe Pradyuman was killed by a senior student who wanted the school to postpone exams and a parent-teacher meeting.","Student Found Dead In Delhi School Toilet, Boys' Fight Caught On CCTV","805409422","2018-02-02","https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/student-found-dead-in-delhi-school-toilet-boys-fight-caught-on-cctv-1807753","NDTV",FALSE
