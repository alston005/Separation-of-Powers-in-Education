Four people were injured in the western city of Bottrop and one person was injured in nearby Essen, while pedestrians managed to jump out of his path in two other attempted attacks in those cities, police said.

""The man had the clear intention to kill foreigners,"" German news agency dpa quoted the top security official in North Rhine-Westphalia state, Herbert Reul, as saying.

The victims included a 46-year-old woman, who suffered life-threatening injuries, and a child. Some of the victims were Syrian and Afghan citizens.

The attacks began shortly after midnight while people were celebrating New Year's out on the streets.

The 50-year-old driver first attempted to hit a group of people in Bottrop, but failed. He then drove into the city center, where he slammed his silver Mercedes into a crowd, injuring four.

He then drove toward Essen, where he twice attempted to run people down, injuring one person, before being arrested by police.

The man, whose name wasn't released, is being held on suspicion of attempted homicide. Police said the suspect made anti-foreigner comments during his arrest and there were indications he had been treated for mental illness in the past.

It's not the first time that a vehicle has been used as an apparent weapon in Germany.

In April, a German man drove a van into a crowd in Muenster, killing four people and injuring dozens. The driver, who had sought psychological help in the weeks preceding the attack, then killed himself.

On 19 December, 2016, a Tunisian man ploughed a truck into a busy Christmas market in Berlin, killing 12 people.

The attack was claimed by the Islamic State group. The driver, who fled the scene, was later killed in a shootout with police in Italy.

Lakhs of women lined up across Kerala's 14 districts on Tuesday to form a human wall as part of the state government's 'vanitha mathil' or women's wall. The wall was organised by the CPI(M)-led LDF government and community outfits backing its stand on the entry of women at the Sabarimala temple.

Although the wall was envisaged as a counter to the Sangh Parivar campaign against the entry of women of all ages at Sabarimala temple following the Supreme Court verdict, the CPI(M) has managed to project the event as a statement of ""progressive Kerala"".

State Minister for Health and Family Welfare K K Shailaja was the starting point of the wall in the northern Kasaragod district, while senior CPI(M) leader and Politburo member Brinda Karat stood as the concluding link of the wall at the southern tip of Thiruvananthapuram district.

The entire ruling LDF cabinet, leaders of community organisations like the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam - which represents the Hindu Ezhava community - , leaders of the Punnala Sreekumar faction of the Kerala Pulaya Mahasabha representing the SC community, and Left-aligned intellectuals, writers, thinkers, activists and actors participated in the movement.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan stated on Facebook, ""The women's wall has become the largest women movement in the country to protect their rights enshrined in the Constitution and defend the attempts to deny them gender justice. This wall is a warning to the conservative-communal forces, which try to deny women their legitimate rights and renaissance values. The women's wall has emerged as a loud announcement that Kerala women are with the progressive thought.""

However, the Opposition Congress boycotted the wall, dubbing it ""communal"" as Hindu organisations were actively involved in the campaign. BJP and upper caste Hindu organisations such as Nair Service Society also kept away from the wall. The BJP had last week lighted an 'ayyappa jyothi' across the state to the northern as a counter to the women's wall.

NSS general secretary Sukumaran Nair, who is leading the Hindu communities opposed to the entry of women of all ages to Sabarimala, said Kerala would become a ""Satan's land"" after the women wall. ""No Chief Minister can destroy traditions and rituals,"" he said.

In Kasaragod district, an attempt to disrupt the wall was reported when a group of men, allegedly belonging to BJP, set on fire a wayside grassland to prevent women from lining up along the road. Police chased them away.

At Edappally - one of the busiest traffic points in Ernakulam district in central Kerala, scores of women lined up on the side of national highway 66. While there were not many minors, there were many elderly women. Exactly at 3.30 pm, the women stood shoulder to shoulder along the entire stretch of the highway, with many wearing the traditional 'kasavu mundu'. Announcements were made over a microphone, requesting the women to not clog roads and to avoid accidents. Senior CPI(M) leadership, including district secretary CN Mohanan, former secretary P Rajeev, Politburo member M A Baby, Politburo member Subhashini Ali, and writer M Leelavathy were present. Nuns of the Jacobite faction of the Christian Church were also present.

At 4.00 pm, the women were requested to raise their hands forward and take a pledge to uphold and protect the social reform values of Kerala and to support the constitutional tenets of gender equality.

In Kochi, Christian nuns also joined the wall while in Malappuram, Muslim women trooped to streets in large numbers to stand for the wall.

Nithya, 23, who works at the IT hub of Infopark in the city, said she had come to show her solidarity with ""the government's vision of a gender equal society"".

""We have to create a new generation that's well aware of our state's rich social reform movements and what they stand for. We have to fight against blind traditions and superstitions,"" she said.

Elizabeth, a school teacher and a member of the Left-backed Kerala State Teachers Association, said the movement was an important marker of female empowerment at a time when the women's right to pray has been violated by male-dominated protests at Sabarimala. ""Viswasam ulla sthreekal keranam (Those who have belief in the deity must be able to enter and pray),"" she said. ""It's a Supreme Court order and the Kerala government has to follow it. The government is handling it in a mature manner. Some political organisations are playing games by making women stand in front.""

At the same time, some participants could not rationally explain why they were there. It was evident that they had been mobilised by community organisations for the sake of building a crowd.

There were also those who took contradictory positions.

Ani, a housewife, said she came for the programme to stand for the rights of women. ""But in the Sabarimala issue, we are on the side of belief (which bars women of menstruation age),"" she said. Her friend Sarada, agreed.

Shortly after the women's wall disbanded, 91-year-old M Leelavathy - one of Kerala's most admired and respected literary critics and writers - underlined in a short speech at a public meeting that gender equality must not remain restricted to cultural and social spheres.

""There must be changes in the political sphere too,"" she said. ""For example, there's a women's reservation bill in Parliament. It advocates 33% reservation for women in Parliamentary constituencies. But I ask, why 33 per cent? Why not 50 per cent? After all, women are half of the country's population. Political leaders must ensure that they pass the bill, ' she said.

Subhashini Ali in her address said she felt wonderful to see scores of women from one end of Kerala to the other upholding principles of equality.

""Many extreme reactionary voices have been speaking on behalf of women in Kerala for the last few months. They have been trying to tell people 'women want this, women don't want this'. Today, lakhs of women have come here to say that you don't need to speak on our behalf. We can speak for ourselves. We want our rights, our equality and we have to move forward. They are telling these people that we have rejected their regressive traditions,"" she said."

According to residents, garbage has piled up around the swamp in such a way that it now appears to have formed an embankment.

Spread over 30 acres, Woodshire has more than 900 flats, out of which only 200 are currently occupied. ""I have been seeing this swamp since I shifted to my flat in July 2018. My flat faces the swamp, which is located in front of the township,"" said Sudhir Bhatnagar, a resident. TOI toured the township and found the large swamp, which has stinky water, trash and swamp vegetation. ""The swamp poses a health hazard for residents. Last year, we had up to 5- 6 dengue cases here,"" Bhatnagar added.

Residents said that they had been told by the developer that the swamp was under private jurisdiction and a road would be constructed on it. ""We were also told that Experion Developers was building a property there and so we thought the swamp would be absorbed into their estate but that never happened,"" said Ashok Yadav, another resident. Residents mentioned a number of problems that have arisen because of the swamp. ""Dharampur village is located in the vicinity of the swamp. The villagers channel all their sewage and waste into this swamp, further complicating the situation. The discharges lead to squalid conditions and growth of vegetation in the swamp, leading to favourable conditions for breeding of mosquitoes. It is a total disaster for us. Those who live below the 10th floor have thousands of mosquitoes humming outside their doors and windows, every day. We can't even open our doors and windows,"" said Santosh, another resident.

Another resident said that the water in the swamp had been stagnant and during monsoon, the water came up to the gate of the township. ""It brings all the filth right here. During winter, the water starts to recede but the stink we deal with is horrible,"" said Somesh Kumar Kashyap, a resident. Many residents also expressed concerns over the safety of children. ""All school buses stop next to the swamp and children have to deboard here. If only the government makes a sewage line for the Dharampur villagers, their waste would not end up here and we would have less problems.""

Bhatnagar said that he filed a complaint in the matter on the CM's Window, as well. ""We filed a complaint on October 11 but since then, it has been moving between the MCG, the DTP and the CM's office. We want immediate redressal of this matter as this pertains to our health and overall living conditions. During monsoon, it becomes an issue of life and death because of water-borne diseases,"" he said.

A senior official from M3M Developers told TOI that the land belonged to the panchayat. ""There is a village in the vicinity and the land belongs to them. We have been in talks with the villagers to get the matter resolved. Previously, they agreed to fill up the land but the work was stalled during monsoon. It will resume soon,"" he added."

Context: A government committee headed by IIT-Hyderabad chairman B V R Mohan Reddy has submitted its report and that its suggestions are being considered by AICTE.

The committee was appointed to come up with a medium and short-term perspective plan for expansion in engineering education.

Important recommendations made by the committee:

More than half the engineering seats fall vacant every year. There were no takers for 51% of the 15.5 lakh B.E/B.Tech seats in 3,291 engineering colleges in 2016-17.

Besides, current capacity utilisation in traditional disciplines is just 40% as opposed to 60% seat occupancy in branches such as computer science and engineering, aerospace engineering and mechatronics.

Mains Question: Examine the challenges faced by higher education sector in India and discuss the impact of policy decisions taken to address these issues?(250 words)

As part of its initiatives to empower women, the Odisha government, last year, launched this scheme to provide free sanitary napkins to school girls across the state.

India is among the first five countries in the world, the first in Asia and the first among the biodiversity-rich megadiverse countries to have submitted the report.

The submission of national reports is a mandatory obligation on parties to international treaties, including the CBD. As a responsible nation, India has never reneged on its international commitments and has earlier submitted on time five national reports to the CBD.

The report provides an update of progress in achievement of 12 National Biodiversity Targets (NBT) developed under the convention process in line with the 20 global Aichi biodiversity targets.

At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, world leaders agreed on a comprehensive strategy for ""sustainable development"" -- meeting our needs while ensuring that we leave a healthy and viable world for future generations. One of the key agreements adopted at Rio was the Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Convention on Biological Diversity is the international legal instrument for ""the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources"" that has been ratified by 196 nations.

The 'Aichi Targets' were adopted by the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at its Nagoya conference. It is a short term plan provides a set of 20ambitious yet achievable targets, collectively known as the Aichi Targets. They can be divided into:

Strategic Goal A: Address the underlying causes of biodiversity loss by mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society.

Strategic Goal B: Reduce the direct pressures on biodiversity and promote sustainable use.

Strategic Goal C: To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and genetic diversity.

Strategic Goal D: Enhance the benefits to all from biodiversity and ecosystem services.

Strategic Goal E: Enhance implementation through participatory planning, knowledge management and capacity building.

Mains Question: Critically evaluate the implementation of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 which is meant to fulfil the objectives of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

For Prelims and Mains: OSIRIS-Rex mission and facts on asteroid bennu.

Context: NASA's OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft has set a new milestone in cosmic exploration by entering orbit around an asteroid, Bennu, the smallest object ever to be circled by a human-made spaceship.

OSIRIS-Rex is the first-ever US mission designed to visit an asteroid and return a sample of its dust back to Earth. The $800 million (roughly Rs. 5,600 crores) unmanned spaceship launched two years ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida and arrived December 3 at its destination, some 70 million miles (110 million kilometres) away.

The plan is for OSIRIS-REx to orbit Bennu through mid-February, using a suite of five scientific instruments to map the asteroid in high resolution to help scientists decide precisely where to sample from.

OSIRIS-Rex stands for Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer.

OSIRIS-REx is the third mission in NASA's New Frontiers program, which previously sent the New Horizons spacecraft zooming by Pluto and the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter.

Bennu was selected for a the OSIRIS-REx mission from over 500,000 known asteroids, due to it fitting a number of key criteria. These include:

Proximity to Earth: In order for OSIRIS-REx to reach its destination in a reasonable timeframe, NASA needed to find an asteroid which had a similar orbit to Earth.

Size: Small asteroids, those less than 200m in diameter, typically spin much faster than larger asteroids, meaning the regolith material can be ejected into space. Bennu is around 500m in diameter, so rotates slowly enough to ensure that the regolith stays on its surface.

Composition: Bennu is a primitive asteroid, meaning it hasn't significantly changed since the beginning of the Solar System (over 4 billion years ago). It is also very carbon-rich, meaning it may contain organic molecules, which could have been precursors to life on Earth.

Additionally, Bennu is of interest as it is a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). Every 6 years, Bennu's orbit brings it within 200,000 miles of the Earth, which means it has a high probability of impacting Earth in the late 22nd Century.

For Prelims and Mains: Ultima Thule and New Horizons- Key facts.

Context: On January 1, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft became the first explorer to fly past the mysterious object- Ultima Thule, located some 4 billion miles from Earth.

Ultima Thule is located in the Kuiper belt in the outermost regions of the Solar System, beyond the orbit of Neptune.

New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006, and has been travelling through space for the past nine years. New Horizon's core science mission is to map the surfaces of Pluto and Charon, to study Pluto's atmosphere and to take temperature readings.

Mains Question: Write a note on the significance of NASA's New Horizons Mission.

For Prelims and Mains: Key provisions and significance of the bill, the need for legislation on outer space.

There is a need for national space legislation for supporting the overall growth of the space activities in India. This would encourage enhanced participation of non-governmental/private sector agencies in space activities in India, in compliance with international treaty obligations, which is becoming very relevant today.

Mains Question: What are the salient features of the Space Activities Bill, 2017? Examine how the use of outer space by ISRO has helped common man in India.

Content: Recognizing their two countries are strategic partners, major and independent stakeholders in world affairs, the Ministers committed to work together on regional and global issues, including in bilateral, trilateral, and quadrilateral formats.

The two sides further decided to establish secure communication between the Minister of External Affairs of India and the U.S. Secretary of State, and between the Minister of Defence of India and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, to help maintain regular high-level communication on emerging developments.

Strengthening the Defense and Security Partnership:

Observing the strong ties of family, education, and business, and the spirit of entrepreneurship and innovation that unite their people, the Ministers highlighted the unmatched people-to-people ties between their countries and recognized the benefits to both nations and the world from these ties, including the free flow of ideas and collaboration in health, space, oceans, and other areas of science and technology.

The next 2+2 meeting is to be held in the United States in 2019.

Establishing Gas Trading Hub/Exchange in the country

It has been agreed to establish the gas trading hub(s)/exchange(s) in the country wherein the natural gas can be freely traded and supplied through a market mechanism.

Development of Natural Gas Grid:

To develop the natural gas grid, Government has taken a decision to provide a capital grant of Rs. 5176 crore (i.e. 40% of the estimated capital cost of Rs. 12,940 Crore) to GAIL for development of a 2655 Km long Jaddishpur-Haldia/Bokaro-Dhamra Gas Pipeline (JHBDPL) project.

This pipeline will transport Natural Gas to the industrial, commercial, domestic and transport sectors in the States of Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.

An Integrated Refinery-cum-Petrochemical Complex:

Oil Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) namely Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) have decided to set up an integrated refinery-cum-petrochemical complex with a refining capacity of 60 MMTPA (Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum) at Babulwadi, Taluka Rajapur in Ratnagiri District in the state of Maharashtra.

Background:

The establishment of a hub is an attempt to meet operators' demands for the adoption of a market-based gas-pricing regime. But India faces challenges in making the dream a reality, amid concerns over third-party access and competition.

The gas hub plan ties in with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to boost the share of natural gas in India's energy mix to 15% by 2030, from just over 6% now.

Domestic supply is also increasing. ONGC, India's largest producer, supplied 23.5bn cubic meters of gas in the 2017-18 financial year and plans to almost double this within the next four years.

The Indian authorities, are considering overhauling the policy of fixed domestic gas prices, currently based on a formula derived from prices in the US, Canada, UK and Russia. Delhi sees itself as a potential candidate for Asia's largest LNG trading hub, in a region that lacks accurate benchmarks reflecting Asian gas fundamentals."

""The rescuers heard crying. The baby was saved by being in a cradle and warmly wrapped up,"" Chelyabinsk regional governor Boris Dubrovsky wrote on his Telegram channel.

The emergencies ministry named the child as a 10-month-old boy after initial reports that the baby was a girl.

Dubrovsky posted video of rescuers pulling the child from a chink between concrete panels and running with him wrapped in a blanket to an ambulance.

The mother of the boy named as Vanya, short for Ivan, also survived the blast, RIA Novosti news agency reported, citing the emergency services.

The child is in an extremely grave condition with serious frostbite of his limbs, a head injury and multiple leg fractures and he will be evacuated for treatment in Moscow, a health ministry statement said.

Part of the 10-storey apartment building collapsed following a gas explosion on Monday morning in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, nearly 1,700 kilometres east of Moscow in the Ural mountains.

The baby was found after rescuers were forced to temporarily halt the search for dozens of missing people in the rubble for fear the rest of the block could come down.

The child survived temperatures that fell overnight to around minus 27 degrees celsius, TASS reported.

So far the incident has claimed at least seven lives and only six survivors have been found, including a 13-year-old boy.

The Soviet-era appartment block was home to around 1,100 people. The blast completely destroyed 35 flats while 10 more were damaged. Residents left homeless were evacuated to a nearby school.

Battling the freezing temperatures, rescuers had worked through the night combing through debris and trying to stabilise the remaining walls. But on Tuesday morning, the head of Russia's emergencies ministry, Yevgeny Zinichev, said the operations had to be temporarily halted.

There is a ""real threat of part of the building collapsing"", Zinichev said. ""It's impossible to continue working in such conditions.""

He added that efforts to stabilise the walls could take up to 24 hours, with emergency workers dismantling the building from the outside while hanging from cranes.

After an all-night search, officials said Tuesday morning they had found seven bodies, all of them adults, while another 37 people remained unaccounted for.

The regional governor Boris Dubrovsky announced a day of mourning on January 2, with flags lowered and entertainment events cancelled, as the disaster toll set a sombre mood in Russia where New Year's Eve celebrations are the biggest annual festivities.

President Vladimir Putin on Monday rushed to the scene, where the blast left hundreds of residents homeless in freezing temperatures.

""It is in the character of our people, despite New Year's festivities, to remember to think of the dead and wounded at this moment,"" a grim-looking Putin said.

National television showed rescue workers searching through mangled heaps of concrete and metal.

""I went out to have a cigarette at quarter-to-six,"" a local man told Russian television. ""There was a blast and a wave of fire... then people started running out."" Other witnesses said the explosion was strong enough to shatter the windows of nearby buildings.

""I woke up and felt myself falling. The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried,"" said another witness.

Located in the mineral-rich southern Urals region, Magnitogorsk, with a population of more than 400,000 people, is home to one of the country's largest steel producers.

Investigators have opened a criminal probe into the accident, with the FSB security service confirming the blast was the result of a gas explosion.

Such deadly gas explosions are relatively common in Russia where much of the infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era and safety requirements are often ignored.

There is a ""real threat of part of the building collapsing"", Zinichev said.

""It's impossible to continue working in such conditions.""

He added that efforts to stabilise the walls could take up to 24 hours, with emergency workers dismantling the building from the outside while hanging from cranes.

After an all-night search, officials said Tuesday morning they had found seven bodies, all of them adults, while another 37 people remained unaccounted for.

Day of mourning

The regional governor Boris Dubrovsky announced a day of mourning on January 2, with flags lowered and entertainment events cancelled, as the disaster toll set a sombre mood in Russia where New Year's Eve celebrations are the biggest annual festivities.

President Vladimir Putin on Monday rushed to the scene, where the blast left hundreds of residents homeless in freezing temperatures.

""It is in the character of our people, despite New Year's festivities, to remember to think of the dead and wounded at this moment,"" a grim-looking Putin said.

National television showed rescue workers searching through mangled heaps of concrete and metal.

""I went out to have a cigarette at quarter-to-six,"" a local man told Russian television. ""There was a blast and a wave of fire... then people started running out.""

Other witnesses said the explosion was strong enough to shatter the windows of nearby buildings.

""I woke up and felt myself falling. The walls were gone. My mother was screaming and my son had been buried,"" said another witness.

Located in the mineral-rich southern Urals region, Magnitogorsk, with a population of more than 400,000 people, is home to one of the country's largest steel producers.

Investigators have opened a criminal probe into the accident, with the FSB security service confirming the blast was the result of a gas explosion.

Such deadly gas explosions are relatively common in Russia where much of the infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era and safety requirements are often ignored."

In 2006-2007, in the early years of the Web 2.0 that emerged phoenix like from the ashes of the dotcom bust of 2000, Michael Wesch, Professor of digital ethnography at Kansas State University, produced a video called ""The Machine is Us/ing Us"". Prior to the emergence of Web 2.0, the world wide web was primarily a read-only medium to publish news and information to a passive audience. Web 2.0, with its focus on user-generated content and a personal network of trust, created a read-write platform that allowed individuals to feed information easily into the system or 'the machine'.

In the process, the machine learnt stuff that it never knew before. Wikipedia, one of the first Web 2.0 platforms, became the biggest repository of information, if not knowledge. This in turn allowed it to influence a whole generation of students, journalists and web users, and shape the way they view the world. For example, this author who has studied in a Catholic missionary school, had had a great regard for Francis Xavier. But this was completely reversed after he read the Wikipedia article about the murderous inquisition that Xavier had unleashed on the Hindus of Goa. Obviously, no one at school had ever talked about such unsavoury matters.

The thrust of Wesch's video was that every action that a person takes in the digital world is used as an input by 'the digital machine' to increase its own knowledge of both the physical world and recursively, about the digital world. Every 'like' of a post on social media or a click on hyperlink on a web page or a mobile app is like a drop of information that individually and collectively adds to the pool of knowledge about what humans know and think.

This, in turn, is used to shape our own worldview by returning recommendations of what next to view, 'like' and click again. Unless you are like Richard Stallman, an advocate of extreme privacy who hardly uses anything digital -- like Google search, cell phones or credit cards -- you have no escape from this tight embrace of the machine. Fortunately, the machine is not yet one monolithic device. Its world has been broken up into fragments -- Google, Baidu, Amazon, Alibaba and Facebook -- by high commercial walls. But in its tireless striving, it certainly does stretch its arms into every nook and corner of human activity and through that, the human mind.

In parallel with the growth of the web, there has been the emergence of data science. This began as an extension of statistics and has evolved into machine learning. Then again there was the classical 1960s style artificial intelligence that, after lying dormant for nearly 30 years, suddenly woke up and adopted the neural network structure of the brain as a new model of machine learning. This neural network model, often referred to as deep learning is the new age artificial intelligence (AI) and it is racing forward with some truly stunning applications in the area of voice and image recognition, language translation, guidance and control of autonomous vehicles, and in decision-making as in loan disbursement and hiring of employees.

Data science has moved through three distinct stages of being descriptive -- reporting data, inferential -- drawing conclusions from data through the acceptance or rejection of hypotheses and finally predictive -- as in the new-age AI. What has really accelerated the adoption and usage of this new AI has been the availability of data and hardware. The backpropagation algorithm that lies at the heart of all neural network based AI systems that are popular today was developed in the 1960s and 1970s but it has become useful only in the last decade.

It is driven by the availability of (a) huge amounts of data, collectable and collected through the web by the machine described in the Wesch video, and (b) enormous yet inexpensive computing power that is available on rentable virtual machines from cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine and Microsoft Azure.

The key driver in this field is cloud computing. Instead of purchasing and installing physical hardware, companies rent virtual machines in the cloud to both store and process data. The simplest and most ubiquitous example of this is Gmail, where both our mail and the mail server are located somewhere in the Internet cloud that we can access with a browser.

But this same model has been used for many mission-critical, corporate applications ranging from e-commerce through enterprise resource planning to supply chain and customer relationship management systems. Though there has been some resistance to cloud computing because of the insecurity of placing sensitive company data on a vendor machine, the price performance is so advantageous that most new software services are all deployed in the cloud -- and that includes machine learning and AI applications.

Cloud service vendors have aggressively marketed their services by not only offering high-end hardware -- as virtual machines -- at very low prices but also by offering incredibly powerful software applications. Complex machine learning software for, say, image recognition, language translation that are ordinarily very difficult to develop are now available and accessible almost as easily as email or social media. Cloud computing services are categorised into Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) or Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

The first category provides a general purpose computing platform with a virtual machine, an operating system, programming languages and database services, where developers can build and deploy applications without purchasing any hardware. The second category is even simpler to use because the software -- like email as in the case of Gmail -- is already there. One needs to subscribe (or purchase) the service, obtain the access credentials, like user ID and password, connect and start using the services right away -- nothing to build or deploy. It is already there waiting to be used.

In an earlier article in Swarajya (March 2017), we had seen how machine learning and now, the new age AI, use huge, terabyte size, sets of training data to create software models that can be used for predictive analytics. This is an expensive exercise that lies beyond the ability of individuals and most corporates. But with AI or machine learning available as SaaS at a fraction of the cost, new software applications that use these services can be built easily. For example, it would be possible to enhance a widely-used accounting software by replacing the user ID/password based login process with a face recognition based login process.

Similarly, the enormous difficulty of building the software for a self driving car, or for a voice-activated IVR telephony, can be drastically reduced by using AI-as-a-Service from a cloud services vendor. Obviously, all cloud services including SaaS assume the existence of rugged, reliable and high-speed data connectivity between the service provider and the device on which the service is being used.

Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) can be seen as a logical extension of this model but a closer examination may yield a far deeper, or intriguing, insight.

Cloud Robotics, a new service from Google is scheduled to go live in 2019 and allow people to build smart robots very easily. It is inevitable that other cloud service vendors will follow suit. While many of us view robots as humanoids -- with arms, legs, glowing eyes, a squeaky voice or a stiff gait -- the reality is generally different. Depending on the intended use, a robot could be a vehicle, a drone, an arm in an automated assembly line or a device that controls valves, switches and levers in an industrial environment. In fact, a robot is anything that can sense its environment and take steps to do whatever it takes to achieve its goals. This is precisely the definition of intelligence or more specifically artificial intelligence. So a robot is an intelligent machine that can operate autonomously to meet its goals.

Traditional robots have this intelligence baked, or hard coded, into its 'brain' -- the physical computer that senses and responds to the stimuli that it receives from its environment. This is no different from its immediate role model -- humans. Human beings, and even most animals, learn how to react and respond to external stimuli ranging from a physical attack to a gentle question and we estimate this intelligence by the quality of their response.

In both cases, the knowledge of the external world as encoded in a model along with the ability to respond is stored locally -- either in the human brain or in the local computer. Cloud robotics replaces the local computer that controls a single robot with a shared computer -- located at the cloud service provider's premises -- that controls thousands of robots. Just as Gmail servers store, serve and otherwise control the mailboxes for millions of users each sitting at home, the cloud robotics servers sitting in some unknown corner of the Internet would be able to control millions of intelligent robots that are driving vehicles, flying drones, controlling devices and operating machines in farms, factories, mines and construction sites across the digitally connected physical world.

Circling back to the Wesch video, with which we began this article, these RaaS servers would not just be controlling machinery across the globe but would also be learning from the robots that it controls by using the robots to collect and build up its own pool of training data. This is an extension of the original Web 2.0 idea -- perhaps we could call it Web 3.0. Here, the machine has not only made a successful transition from the digital to the physical world, but also does not need humans anymore to teach it. It can become a self sustaining, self learning physical device.

Privacy would be an immediate issue and like all other cloud services, cloud robotics would be protected with access control and data encryption. But then as we have seen in the past, convenience trumps privacy. We all know that Google can read our Gmail but nevertheless, we still use Gmail simply because it is convenient and free! So would be the case with cloud robotics. We also know that the different RaaS vendors would try to isolate their own robots from interacting with the servers of other vendors or even from each other. But this could be a temporary reprieve. Collaboration among various vendors and pooling of data could happen either through mergers and acquisitions or because it is mandated by governments that are not concerned about privacy issues.

The need for privacy arises because each sentient human sees itself as a unique identity -- I, me and mine -- that is surely distinct from the collective crowd. My data becomes private because it needs to be protected, or shielded, from the collective crowd. But if we go back to the philosophical roots of the Indic Sanatana Dharma and explore the perspectives of Advaita Vedanta, we see that that this sense of ""I""ness is erroneous. Each apparently unique individual is actually a part of a transcendent and collective consciousness referred to as the Brahman.

The Brahman is the only reality and everything else is an error of perception. The world is maya, an illusion that perpetuates this sense of separateness, and creates this distinction between the individual and the world. The correct practice of yoga can lead to the removal of this veil of illusion and initiates the process of realisation. That is when the yogic adept sees the unbroken continuity between his own identity and that of the Brahman and experiences the ecstasy of enlightenment.

We know that many renowned yogis have actually experienced this enlightenment. AI products have now gone well past image and voice recognition and are now known to have the sophistication necessary to create their own private, non-human languages and original strategies in multi-user, role playing games. What we need to know is what happens when robots start emulating yogis and eventually realise their identity with the cloud robotics server of which they are a part."

For many students, it also led to loss of their precious documents. In this environment of despair, there was a welcome announcement. As a special gesture to students from CBSE affiliated schools, whose board exam academic documents such as marksheets, migration certificates, pass certificates were lost or damaged in the Kerala floods, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) decided to facilitate and provide digital mark sheets, migration certificates and pass certificates, made possible due to the integration with DigiLocker. With over 1,300 schools are affiliated to the CBSE in Kerala, this was a significant step as board exam academic documents are crucial for admission for higher studies and employment. This announcement also showed India the importance of electronic storing and validation of documents.

Targeted at the idea of paperless governance, DigiLocker was created as an electronic platform for issuance and verification of documents and certificates in a digital way, thus eliminating the use of physical documents. Organisations that are registered with Digital Locker can push electronic copies of documents and certificates (e.g. driving license, Voter ID, School certificates) directly into citizens lockers. Citizens can also upload scanned copies of their legacy documents in their accounts. These legacy documents can be electronically signed using the eSign facility.

As part of the Indian Tech Leaders Series, we are honoured to bring you the views of Amit Ranjan, Architect, National DigiLocker Project (National eGov Division, Ministry of IT, GoI) who shares the key aspects that were considered while building DigiLocker, the role of open source, and his future vision for DigiLocker

As the CTO / key architect of DigiLocker, what are some of the key aspects that you have kept in mind while designing the platform for scalability?

DigiLocker is a key Digital India initiative for paperless governance and its goal is to create a nationwide federated document exchange network operating across the public and private space. Accordingly, scalability has been one of the key design principles for the project right from the inception stage. The selection of technology and architecture was made in a way that would allow the platform to scale vertically and horizontally. The platform uses concepts like Open APIs, microservices based architecture, cloud storage, caching etc. to achieve this goal.

The partners which integrate with DigiLocker as ""Issuers"" host their data (or documents) individually on their own servers, without any centralised aggregation, thus reducing the risks that may be associated with a single point of failure.

The project was divided into phases with realistic targets. The phases provided concrete goals in terms of key metrics like anticipated number of users of the platform, file storage parameters, database performance etc. Additionally, the infrastructure is constantly monitored, adjusted and fine-tuned with every major release. Scaling an application isn't a one-time activity, but a dynamic, continuing process that needs constant changes and iterations in architecture and solutions used. The technology and product teams running DigiLocker are in a constantly learning mode to face the unique challenges that come up with every stage of the fast-growing platform's evolution.

How important is open source to the overall development and design of DigiLocker?

DigiLocker runs almost exclusively on open source technologies. This is in line with (MeitY) Ministry of Electronics & IT's policy of encouraging open source with a view to promote reuse, reduce cost, invoke community participation and allow peer review. Open source promotes innovation by giving the freedom to try, test and scale your solution, one step at a time. An additional advantage of using open source over proprietary solutions in a government set-up, is reduced time cycles due to absence of RFPs, tendering etc.

DigiLocker is based on open source programming languages like PHP, Python and Node.js. On the server front, it uses Apache, Nginx, MemCache, databases like MongoDB & MariaDB, file systems like GlusterFS etc. The DigiLocker user application (DigiLocker portal) is based on an open source application called OwnCloud. OwnCloud is a very popular solution globally for building open sourced, cloud based, document management systems. DigiLocker with over 15 million users, is the world's largest OwnCloud installation. The DigiLocker team is in constant touch with OwnCloud's open source developer community for feedback and constant iterative learning.

In your view, what are some of the major areas/functions on which DigiLocker has made a major impact in the country? Can you cite some examples?

DigiLocker's impact can be gauged from the fact that it has digitised 294 crore citizen documents and made it available on a user-friendly cloud application that be accessed across web and mobile devices. 64 issuers comprising government and private organizations have been integrated with DigiLocker; prominent amongst them are UIDAI (for eAadhaar), Ministry of Transport (for digital driving licenses & vehicle registrations), Income Tax Department (for PAN verification records), Ministry of Petroleum (for LPG subscription vouchers), CBSE (for Std X & XII marksheets and certificates), NSDC (for skill certificates), eDistrict applications of 13 state governments, secondary education boards of 12 states (for school marksheets and certificates) etc. Citizens have started using DigiLocker in ways that make their lives simpler and paperless.

Here are some notable examples:

* Thousands of citizens are showing their DigiLocker driving license and registration certificates to traffic policemen everydaywhen stopped on the road

* Railway passengers are showing DigiLocker's digital documents to ticket collectors for identity verification

* CBSE announced Std X & XII board results in May 2018; on that day itself, digital marksheets of students was made available to them in their DigiLocker accounts

* Many Fintech startups into consumer lending have integrated with DigiLocker for digitally verifying loan applicants in a few minutes (versus hours or days earlier)

* After the recent Kerala floods, where over a million state residents have lost their identity documents, the state government is working with DigiLocker for reissuing of digital documents directly into citizens' DigiLocker accounts to safeguard against a natural calamity occurring again. So overall one can say that DigiLocker's usage is growing, though a lot more needs to be done.

Your future vision for DigiLocker

DigiLocker's vision falls under the ambit of the Digital India mission to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy. The goal of the project is to provide to all Indian citizensa digital platform for paperless services, that they can use in their daily lives. In many ways, the project is ""competing with paper"" through the use of innovative technology.

The entire ecosystem of paper - from its creation, to printing, to storing, transferring and verifying it is slow, inconvenient, wasteful, corruption inducing, besides being unfriendly to the environment. We think DigiLocker can be a transformative game-changer here and make the lives of Indian citizens simpler and more convenient than before. It will also lead to reduced bureaucracy, result in massive cost savings and usher in a new era of technology enabled governance.

BY DANFES

Ask an artist & a connoisseur about their great fear & the greatest love. Their answer respectively would be acting & watching a ""Live performance on stage"". If there existed one medium that nourishes your conscience, titillates your senses, warms your cockles & serves your soul, it must be by way of an expression of honesty, exclusive to theatre alone. People like Girish Karnad, Mahesh Dattani, Rahul da Cunha, Dolly Thakore, Lilette Dubey, Naseeruddin Shah, Makarand Deshpande, Quasar Thakore Padamsee tell you a tale of how theatre can be liberating, educating, inspirational, reinvigorating & accomplishing too.

In India, theatre has been an inseparable part of the Indian culture from where some of the legendary actors & actresses have made a mark in art & film world. The challenges to keep such a thing alive have only multiplied in recent times with virtually no support or succour in terms of either the tech or the audiences. It would be a travesty if we were eventually to come to grips without theatre performances or personalities. That would be a sham. Veteran film & theatre personalities have expressed their deep dismay about the fading of live stage performances as also the failure of the stakeholders & Government machinery to protect this cultural legacy from vanishing.

Modern day millennial & Gen Y is highly impatient & unappreciative of theatre. Even when they acknowledge the need to enjoy the best quality content, service & resounding atmosphere, they may not be receptive to the idea of staying stuck inside an ordinary auditorium for what they think isn't worth the time. Theatre alas, may not live up to such an expectation given the diminishing value & lack of audiences that could make providing such facilities possible. This is where a very strong opinion is building about televising such plays. That may just be what the doctor had ordered for the ailing art as echoed by noted film & television personalities.

Theatre performances are akin to storytelling. The artists feel that drama or a play is one of the most original forms of art. What you may blurredly get to see in a movie, is honestly played on stage. Be it social stories, mythical, political stories, stories about our livelihood, our society, romanticism or poetry, everything can be conveyed through a play. Hence it is imperative that this art form is protected, preserved & nurtured for future generations to understand the meaning of pure depiction & expression of human feelings & sentiments. So while the forces responsible for the survival of this trade shall do everything at their command to keep it alive, it remains to be seen how far they can succeed in this noble mission.

The beauty of performing art is that it is experienced live by several people at any one given time and at one given venue. But a particular performance cannot reach everywhere. That is the limitation of theatre as opposed to cinema, which can be showcased, or a serial which can be telecast in multiple mediums, multiple places at the same time. So, is the emergence of new age Bollywood stories taking away the essence of watching a play? The jury is out on this. It is ironic that while Bollywood has actually benefited from theatre with gifted actors, writers & directors having come from this world only, theatre has itself receded into oblivion with no reciprocal support or helming by the film industry.

Theatre is a medium that cuts into your deepest crevices of conscience & provides for a reason to introspect. It has all the ingredients of a perfect pot boiler sans noise like psychology, emotions, society & politics. It is actually the best vehicle for communicating human truth and this does not go out of fashion.

Though we are witnessing some sort of a crisis in this medium depicting human action & emotion, the situation isn't so terribly dire. There is a growing incidence of the newbie's taking to theatre to give vent to their feelings. We may not call it resurgence; however more and more youngsters are experiencing theatre right from their school days to college & after. These are good signs for sure. By indulging in theatrics, youngsters get exposed to intellectually stimulating experiences & it also unleashes the instinctive leaning that lay hidden within. Hence presenting such plays on television & reproducing the ones played on stage could lend fresh life to this dying art form.

There cannot be a better medium than theatre to showcase our rich cultural heritage & history. Hence a concerted effort is required to preserve the art of drama and emotions of theatre, increasing its reach beyond a few privileged cities and taking it to audiences short of time. Tata Sky has recently launched Tata Sky Theatre, a 24-hour dedicated platform to provide an ad-free theatre-watching experience on digital devices. The content is curated with the best plays and performances from the finest theatre groups, bringing multiple genres of plays under one platform to be accessible from the comfort and convenience of one's home.

Theatre is one of the oldest surviving forms of expression & entertainment. More so in India where legends have been made & life depicted in the most humane & honest form ever. In conclusion, televising may be the next big thing that could happen to theatre performances & plays. With such big audiences & the capacity of individual broadcaster to attract more, theatre could well be on course to revival through the medium of television. These sure are interesting times to watch out for."

Their mantra is to sound politically correct unlike their compatriots in Hollywood & elsewhere, where all top celebrities take the lead in being the voice of millions of their fans as & when they felt the need to do so. Not true of our film industry whose contribution in building society pales infront of their penchant to raking in moolah & undeservingly bragging the demi-God status.

So when actor-writer-director Tigmanshu Dhulia feels the society is going down the drains at present, and says it is imperative to teach children to respect women from the start, wouldn't it have been be apt to sermonise his own ilk first. ""I think today's society is going down the drains. The value system, the respect for women; I mean we see it every day in papers. The reasons are different and more politically driven, but we will not go down that road now. I would say it is imperative we teach our children to respect women not just from our family or social circle, but women in general.

""We live in well-connected world, but we must strive to revive our value system,"" Dhulia told DANFES in an e-mail. He also said his generation was very lucky to witness so many things right from telegram to television to the latest technology. ""But today, it has gone down drastically. I think we are a semi feudal-semi colonial society, and we must end that. Only then will we see more respect in the society for women as well as the country,"" he said.

Dhulia's directorial career includes National Award winning film ""Paan Singh Tomar"" and ""Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster"" and his acting prowess was captured brilliantly in projects like ""Manjhi - The Mountain Man"" and ""Gangs of Wasseypur"". He is currently seen playing the role of Shah Rukh Khan's father in ""Zero"". Dhulia was present at a grand scale theatrical play of Mahabharata from the point of view of Gandhari, Kunti and Draupadi, by students of Mount Litera School International. Following its inquiry-based learning methodology, the play aimed to imbue Indian values in the students and showcase human frailties, character flaws and highlight follies of the great and good of society.

Directed by veteran theatre artist, Kriti V Sharma, the play was larger than life and successfully conveyed the messages of gender equality as well as the importance of rightly managing great power and ego.

Talking about the use of unique teaching methodologies and how important it is to imbibe Indian values in the students, Dhulia said that he studied in a Christian school and later, in perspective, he would wonder why we were not taught mythology."

Whether you want to solve the world's problems or pander to your own desires, there's a solution out there for all of us

2018 had a big boom in science and technology, which ushered in some impressive tech from notable and new names, such as ShelfPack's suitcase which unpacks itself and Vollebak's solar-powered jacket. Our technical creativites come out whether we're watching Rick and Morty and Black Mirror or even looking at a product with which we're well familiar and mentally elevating its functions.

We spoke to people across different industries and ages for their ultimate tech wishes -- plus, we let you know if they already exist, so you can make the most of your 2019.

""A restaurant spends a lot of time every day in deciding kitchen assignments, drawing up duty charts, getting things in place to reduce wastage of resources and so on, I would want a tech tool that can do all these functions, compute the menu lists, assign people to different sections and take steps to ensure that food wastage does not occur, if specific numbers are keyed into the device. It will help the industry a lot.""

What's out there?

Platforms such as apicbase.com have food management solutions on the cloud that can offer many solutions to these issues. To reduce food wastage, applications like Winnow can help. This UK-based startup uses a touchscreen tablet to identify what the kitchen staff put in the bin.

An electronic scale records the weight and sends a message to the user, giving the cost of the food they've put in the bin. The meter is connected to cloud software which records and analyses the day's waste. This gives owners and managers the information necessary to drive improvements in their system.

The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter globally. It is a huge consumer and polluter of water. The young designer adds, ""A huge amount of water is used for dyeing fabrics and this contaminated water is in turn released. The vast amounts of water needed can have a devastating effect on the environment and I would love to see some technology where so much water is not required to do the needful. But maily something more affordable for smaller scale designers would be ideal.""

There are a lot of solutions currently in the market, but they sure do cost a pretty penny. 6 years ago, Nike announced a strategic partnership with DyeCoo Textile Systems B.V. which will scale down water consumption in the dyeing process. But an affordable version is yet to be developed.

""In this time and age, all of us are on the phones. The ambient sounds of our streets, the music in the clubs we frequent to relax are also very loud and not safe for the ears. As a musician, having an audience that can hear well and make out the nuances of different strands of music is very important. I would want a tech tool encoded in our phones, that allows us to measure the sounds we listen to on a daily basis and can issue warnings if we exceed the permissible limits. This is very important, since there is a good chance that people with hearing loss issues may not realise there is an issue that needs immediate attention.""

What's out there?

Using a noise-cancelling headphone might be helpful and may offer short-term solutions. Since a sound counter is not yet in the works, it would be a good idea to listen on earphones/headphones with the volume turned down, and moderate the use of these devices.

The skilled mixologist and beverage consultant relies on both his innate and honed senses to do his job right, ""but if we're talking industryrelated, my biggest tech wish has to be a rotovap and centrifuge machine.""

What's out there?

This isn't quite an 'out there' invention, but the rotovap and centrifuge machine aids in the process of clarifying and increasing the yield of juices and in separating out 'milk-washed' spirit. Of course, those familiar with a chemistry lab will know a centrifuge is simply used to separate ingredients by their weight. Some of the big names out there in mixology and cuisine have already sold thousands.

The student of Government High School in Hyderabad has a keen interest in biology and explains, ""I'd love to have a microscope that's affordable and, more importantly, easy to carry between home and school.""

What's out there?

Manu Prakash and Jim Cybulski co-invented the Foldscope, a portable microscope which is yours for $1. The Foldscope is an origamibased optical microscope that can be assembled from a flat sheet of paper in under 10 minutes. It can provide over 2,000× magnification with submicron resolution, weighs less than two nickels (8.8 g), is small enough to fit in a pocket (70×20×2 mm3), requires no external power, and can survive being dropped from a 3-storey building or stepped on by a person.

""In terms of getting stuff delivered from a friend halfway across the city, to getting that chocolate cake delivered in less than 30 minutes, everything in Bengaluru can get done with tech solutions. However, this is lacking in the daily commute space. I stay in Sarjapur road and travel to MG road every day. It is a distance of almost 19 kilometres that takes more than an hour-and-a-half by car.""

""I now take a share auto till the Carmelaram station, take a train till Bengaluru city and then get on the metro. Though the metro is usually efficient, the other modes of transport are not as much. Trains are constantly delayed and buses never come on time. I want a tech tool that will tell me where a particular bus is and when it will arrive at the bus stop. In terms of improving commutes, I feel technology should come up with something to prevent traffic bottlenecks.""

What is out there?

There are plenty of apps in Bengaluru that can tell you what time your bus will arrive at a particular bus stop, such as Bangalore Buses and the BMTC app. In trains as well, applications and online tools like Find My Train and RailYatri are quite accurate in getting the information on trains. As far as solving logjams goes, it is best to wait and see if Elon Musk's ambitious project of getting people to travel on tubes underground will work.

Professor Raveesha loves to interact with his students to find out what could be the latest inventions in tech. He suggests that mobile phones could be upgraded even more. ""My tech wishlist would be a mobile phone with a telescope,"" he says. ""The common man would be able to take photographs of the moon and see what is on its surface. It would be beneficial for students interested in astronomy and the defence sector. I think Apple would design such a phone in the near future.""

Addressing the universal problem of charging mobile phones while on-the-go, Professor Raveesha says, ""I also wish for long-charging mobile phone batteries that will last for a month. Long-lasting batteries will not only be convenient for the common man, but would also be of use to space engineers.""

What's out there?

There are laptops that run on solar energy. It needs to become more popular and I am sure it will soon!"

From the murder of a police officer in South Delhi to the molestation case of a teacher in the heart of the National Capital, such cases did grab headlines but have remained unsolved till now. Police officials claim that all possible efforts and measures were undertaken, despite that they have failed to get a breakthrough. In 2018 up to November 30, 2,25,123 cases were reported compared to 2,33,580 cases in 2017.

Following cases have continued to reach to definite conclusion:

Late on the night of September 11, a head constable of Delhi police, who had stepped out of his house to buy flour from the market, was shot dead by unknown assailants just 200 meters away from his house in South East Delhi's Jaitpur area.

The deceased Ram Awtar Kholwar, a 2003 batch officer was posted at the Ambedkar Nagar police station in South Delhi. He hailed from Karouli in Rajasthan.

Police said they are suspecting the involvement of some known person behind the attack or it could be that Awtar had spotted some persons carrying out suspicious activities in the area. He was shot at when he confronted the assailants. Ramavatar had suffered a bullet injury below his right ribs. ""there is no headway since the crime took place after dark and there were no CCTV cameras installed around the spot, police are trying to look for eyewitnesses but have not been able to find any. Several teams have been formed and we are hopeful to arrest the accused soon,"" said Chinmoy Biswal, Deputy Commissioner of Police (South- East).

More than 50 people have been rounded up to gather information in the case while an FIR under IPC Section 302 (murder) was registered at Jaitpur police station, police said.

Awtar had arrested around eight proclaimed offenders and contributed to investigations in several important cases. He was survived by his wife and two children aged 10 and 6. His elder brother also works with the Delhi police.

On September 22, a 65-year-old woman and her 42-year-old handicapped daughter were found dead inside their house in Paschim Vihar. The police has been probing the case from all angles while suspected the role of an unknown acquaintance. However, no arrest has been made so far.

Shashi Talwar lived with her mentally-challenged daughter, Nidhi in the first floor of a building ever since the demise of Shashi's husband. Shashi also has two sons, Vishal and Abhay living in Mumbai and Canada, respectively.

Nidhi's body was found on the bed in the first room. ""Her mouth was stuffed with a cloth, her hands tied and a pillow lying nearby on the bed,"" he said. ""Shashi's body was found with her throat slit in the kitchen,"" a police official said.

""Prima facie it appears that the culprit were known to the family as there were no signs of tussle at the entry gate. We are not ruling out any angle including enmity, burglary attempt, property dispute, etc. Investigation is underway but no arrest has been made so far,"" said Seju P Kuruvilla, Deputy Commissioner of Police, (Outer).

On December 1, 2017, a 32-year-old professor had to face a horrendous incident of molestation in Connaught Place (CP), the heart of the national Capital. A man groped her, unzipped his pants, and masturbated in front of her while she was taking a break from her work in a language school in CP.

The woman had gone to the terrace of the building when the incident took place. The accused, who is yet to be arrested, also snatched her phone before fleeing the spot.

According to the complainant, its been more than a year since the incident took place however, the cops have not been able to trace the victim and arrest him. She still recalls the trauma and remembers that during her break as usual, she went to the terrace of the building to smoke. A man in his mid 20s followed her to the terrace but she didn't pay much attention. The accused constantly stared at her while pretending to be on the phone. When she asked him whether there was a problem, he said there wasn't but did not move from the spot. Then he suddenly came in front of her and pointed at her breasts.

She pushed him and threatened to call the police. Instead of feeling deterred, he flashed at her. While she was trying to escape the spot he grabbed her and ejaculated.

""As there no concrete evidence of the man, we have not been able to trace anyone. Even in the CCTV footage seen, it shows that the man following the victim but his face was hidden by a hoodie,"" said a senior police officer.

On August 25, 2017, Shashwat Pande, a radiologist at the St. Stephen's hospital was found dead with his throat slit and multiple stab wounds inside the hospital's CT scan lab. The prime suspect in the case was another doctor Suyash Gupta who had allegedly been stalking the victim for the past two years.

Gupta was suspended by the hospital as well. Pande had several times complained to the hospital authorities about the behaviour of the accused and harassment he was facing. The accused has allegedly fled to Nepal.

After eight months, the Delhi Police have transferred investigation in the murder case of St. Stephen's doctor Shashwat Pande to the Crime Branch.

However, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was handed over the case which the Delhi Police was earlier investigating the case but failed to trace the prime accused, another senior doctor at the hospital, who has been absconding for almost a year now.

The police suspect that he might be hiding in Nepal but admitted that there are no significant clues that he might be living there. However, the Delhi High Court was hearing the petition moved by the parents of Gupta, seeking his whereabouts.

The police have hiked the reward amount for any information on Gupta, from Rs 50,000 to Rs1 lakh."

In a bid to restore the Kashmiri Paper Mache -- a 600-year-old art which is dying a silent death -- nearly 25 Srinagar-based craftsmen have turned to the country's premier design institute for assistance.

The craftsmen have enrolled in the National Institute of Design as students to learn new techniques, contemporary designs and upgrade their skills to be able to meet the commercial demands.

As part of the Centre's initiative Upgrading the Skills and Training in Traditional Arts/Crafts for Development (USTTAD), which was launched in 2015, the NID has been enrolling minority communities like Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Parsis and Jains, engaged in the practice of traditional arts and crafts.

NID professor Tanishka Kachru said, ""The craftsmen have been facing a lot of threat from poor exposure to newer technologies, low capital and absence of market intelligence. We are training them on how to make contemporary products appealing to both, the national and international markets by themselves.""

NID is training them in mould-making, building structural stability with the material through innovations, using e-commerce platforms, marketing, et cetera. ""Since they are dependent on a network of people to sell their products, we are training them how to click good pictures of the products and upload online,"" she said.

The government of Kashmir only recently included paper-mâché as part of the school curriculum to promote the art. The art of paper mache across the world has been adorning drawing rooms in the form of wall hangings, to paper stands, to jewellery boxes to souvenirs.

Paper mâché is a delicate but highly decorative art introduced to Kashmir in the 15th Century by a local prince who learnt the art during the years he spent in prison at Samarkand in Central Asia. This unique craft involves the use of paper pulp to create beautifully painted artefacts."

THE incessant drilling continues throughout the conversation, as it does through most of the day. Their home a stone's throw from where tunnelling work is underway for the Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ Metro rail, 88-year-old Narayan Lavate's forehead is creased. ""I don't know whether we'll be alive when the first station comes,"" says Narayan, a resident of the Laxmibai chawl in Kalbadevi's Zaobawadi area.

Exactly a year ago, Narayan and his wife Iravati had written to the President of India, seeking permission for physician-assisted suicide before they become bed-ridden or before they die a slow natural death, of old age or terminal illness. Certain now that their plea will not be accepted, the couple is bracing for a city where they have seen change intimately change some more.

The Lavates' letter was forwarded to the Maharashtra government chief secretary for consideration. After some correspondence, the couple says they know their wish won't be fulfilled. ""We never thought we will see 2019 coming. But I guess we will,"" Narayan says as Iravati nods.

The couple lives alone in Laxmibai chawl, Narayan's home for 75 years. Iravati moved in 51 years ago, upon marrying him. Through the decades that Narayan spent working with the state transport department and Iravati as a teacher at the Aryan Education Society High School, they have seen Mumbai's transition. From a tram ride at 10 paisa per head to the death of the city tram in 1964, to buses to CNG buses and now electric buses, from taxis to Ubers, and now the Metro rail, the Lavates have watched keenly.

Advertising

Iravati's evening strolls have ceased. Blue barricades with ""Mumbai is upgrading' painted on them dominate the roads outside the chawl. ""I would walk to the Ram temple in Kalbadevi every evening. Now the roads are dug up. There is no footpath. I am afraid I'll fall,"" says Iravati (79). It's getting increasingly tough to hail a taxi, so every time she needs a ride, she calls a former student to come pick her up.

Two chawl buildings near their home will be pulled down soon as they prepare to undergo redevelopment. Narayan's visits every afternoon to his old office in Mumbai Central have also stopped. ""There's too much traffic,"" he says. The only thing that remains constant in their lives is the limited water supply in their chawl building. There's water in the taps from 5 am to 6 am, like clockwork. Every morning Narayan immerses himself in five newspapers, regional and English, to stay updated. He still does not wear spectacles. Iravati switches to television every evening to watch a Marathi soap.

Since their letter to the President, several NGOs approached them throughout 2018 to place them in old age homes. The two refused. ""We don't want to depend on anyone. That is why we did not have children,"" Iravati says. ""But now even to walk outside on the lane, I need help.""

A maid buys them vegetables every day and cleans their house. Iravati receives Rs 25,000 in pension every month, they spend Rs 500 per day. The couple disagrees on multiple topics, including who will operate the TV. But they agree on one point. What would they wish to change about the city? ""The space for pedestrians. Hawkers have been pushed to the footpaths,"" Iravati says, as Narayan nods."

But the past 12 months saw several incidents which, though making headlines at that time, slipped off public memory in months to come,

Most Passionate Fan

Diego Maradona: In a demoralising World Cup campaign, Argentina experienced fleeting jubilation with Marcos Rojo's 86th-minute winner against Nigeria. The happiest of them all was Maradona, who flipped double middle fingers at the hecklers seated below and almost fell over in the process. During the 90-minute journey of self discovery, the Argentine legend resembled the subject of Renaissance art. The 58-year-old unfurled a banner with a picture of himself as a saint, celebrated Lionel Messi's goal with a convulsive religious experience, fell asleep at halftime, danced with a Nigeria supporter, stumbled to the VIP lounge and was carried away by paramedics. AFP

The Cristiano Ronaldo worst footballer statue

Mo Salah: What is it with footballers getting the Avant-garde treatment in their home countries? The statue of Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah unveiled in Egypt drew comparisons with the much-ridiculed bust of Ronaldo at the Madeira airport. The sculpture featured Salah in his trademark celebration, albeit with an oversized head and unusually short and skinny legs. ""I welcome all criticisms this statue received; this is natural because an artist is subjected to a number of tastes but I am personally not happy with the statue's final product,"" said artist Mai Abdel Allah.

Worst midfielder of the year

Manuel Neuer: Disciple of the Cruyff 'In my teams, goalie is the first attacker' school of Total Football, Neuer fancies himself as a bit of an outfield player. Seldom reckless, the keeper sweeps up to clear the ball and collect backward passes, enabling the backline to push forward. The chip over rushers, cheeky pull-backs, outside of the boot flicks and van Persie-style dives outside his penalty box have further added to his lore. So with defending champions Germany a goal down to South Korea and on their way out of the World Cup, Neuer decided to abandon his post in a Hail Mary attempt. Playing ahead of the two defenders, Neuer wandered aimlessly before squandering a throw-in with the heaviest of touches. Ju Se-jong swooped in, robbed the lumbering Neuer, spun back inside and launched a long pass towards the empty German goal. Son Heung-min did the needful as Neuer, a giraffe among deer, watched from 80 yards away.

Worst use of a pair of shoes

After Nike revealed Colin Kaepernick -- the former San Francisco 49er quarterback who inspired the wave of player protest in the NFL -- as one of the faces for the company's latest ad campaign, many aggrieved customers went 'full Murica' and uploaded videos of sneakers and sportswear being set on fire while the Star Spangled Banner blared in the background. #IDontWearPolitics trended while Nike shares closed at record highs.

Honourable mention: French striker Olivier Giroud, who won the World Cup without a shot at goal.

Thinking outside the box moment

Khabib Nurmagomedov: Sometimes, winning a fight just isn't enough. Especially, a fight promoted by thrown dollies and shattered windows, mocked families and alleged terrorist connections. So after cranking megastar Conor McGregor into a lump at UFC 229, Nurmagomedov leapt out of the cage, onto the Irishman's outspoken trainer and into MMA folklore. The Dagestani, on a victory tour bordering on political puppetry since, recently spoke at a Q&A session in Saudi Arabia where he advised female fighters to ""be fighter inside your home"" and ""finish your husband.""

Unluckiest teammate of the year

Valtteri Bottas: The Finn couldn't catch a break this year. While Lewis Hamilton collected his sixth championship, Bottas failed to win a race. There was the last-gasp puncture in Baku and the loss of hydraulics pressure in Austria. The stinger came in Russia, when the team ordered him to move out of the way and let Hamilton pass for the win.

All-around performer of the year

Simone Biles: In January, Biles added her name to the list of nearly 160 women who spoke out about being the victim of sexual abuse by jailed US Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. In August, she won her fifth national championship wearing a teal leotard -- the designated colour to represent survivors of sexual abuse. And in October, a day after USA Gymnastics hired Mary Bono as its new president, Biles called out Bono for protesting Nike's association with Colin Kaepernick. Bono resigned less than a week into her job. At last month's World Championships in Doha, Biles fell off the beam during the all-around event, failed to stick the landing on the vault and stepped out of bounds on floor exercise, and still handily won four gold medals, and six in total; the 21-year-old was in hospital on the eve of the event due to complications from a kidney stone and competed without passing, what came to be known as, the Doha pearl.

Best counter-attack of the year

Virat Kohli: After his first series loss at Centurion in January, Kohli was getting an idea about the scrutiny a defeated Indian captain goes through. Quizzed if the team, which had failed to chase 287, was India's best XI, Kohli, part philosopher, part troll, fired back with ""What's the best XI?"" ""Was it your best XI?"" the journalist further pressed, to which Kohli responded ""But if we had won this, was this the best XI?"" Captain ended another testy exchange with ""Doesn't matter. Wherever we play, we try to do our best. I'm here to answer your questions, not to fight with you.""

Honourable mention: Belgium scything through Japan in less than ten seconds to win the Round of 16 clash 3-2

Best Indian cricket team in the last 15-20 years award

Virat Kohli and Co: ""I can't see any other Indian team in the last 15-20 years that has had the same run in such a short time,"" said national coach Ravi Shastri after India suffered its second straight series defeat, this time in England. Former captains and stats disagreed, but Kohli had his coach's back at a press conference. ""We have to believe we are the best side. Why not?"" said Kohli, before launching another counter-attack. ""What do you think?"" The reply was ""I am not sure,"" and Indian captain ended the chat with, ""That's your opinion. Thank you."" There might be something to the claim however, as India won their first Boxing Day Test in Australia and Kohli joined Sourav Ganguly as joint-Most successful Indian captain away from home.

The 2018 Tom & Jerry award

BCCI: The BCCI officials continued to disagree with the SC order. Vinod Rai and Diana Edulji, the two CoA, continued to disagree with the BCCI officials. Edulji didn't agree with Rai on the Rahul Johri #MeToo issue. Edulji said Johri's presence made all women in the BCCI uncomfortable. Rai didn't agree. When the committee cleared Johri, Edulji didn't agree. A BCCI official wanted to travel to Australia but both Rai and Edulji didn't agree. Rai and Edujli gave special status to Puducherry Ranji Trophy team, the BCCI officials didn't agreeing with them. Mithali Raj didn't agree with coach Romesh Powar. Captain Harmanpreet and Edulji didn't agree with Mithali. Rai didn't agree with Edulji on Powar being retained as coach. Edulji quoted the Virat Kohli-Ravi Shastri precedent but Rai didn't agree. Edulji didn't agree with Rai on forming a committee to pick a new coach. Johri got a legal opinion, Edulji, questioning his mandate, didn't agree. Meanwhile, Rai didn't agree with Edulji, and over-ruled her. Edulji didn't agree with Rai, asking who gave him the veto. Disappointed by this bizarre power tussle, Justice RM Lodha, the man whose reforms Rai and Edulji were brought together to implement, said, ""they were making a spectacle of themselves"".

Employee of the year

Cristiano Ronaldo: Ronaldo is being sued by a teacher from Nevada, who claims the footballer sexually assaulted her and then dispatched a team of 'fixers' to manipulate her into keeping quiet. It's an ongoing investigation, but employers Juventus issued a character certificate in October. ""Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus,"" tweeted the Italian club. ""The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion.""

Reporter of the year

Shubhankar Sharma: At the World Golf Championship-Mexico in March, Phil Mickelson was busy honing his already formidable short game on the practice green when the five-time major winner was approached by a couple of -- or so he thought -- members of the media. With the business end about to get underway, Leftie curtly told them to buzz off and come later for interviews. Only, he soon realised, the duo was tournament leader Shubhankar Sharma and his caddie and former pro, Gurbaaz Mann. The mix-up was understandable as the 21-year-old Sharma, though top of the leaderboard, was making his debut on the PGA Tour. Mickelson apologised and got to know Sharma better when the duo paired up in the final round.

Worst inside scoop of the year

Jorge Mendes: With Manchester United free-falling under Jose Mourinho, the manager's all-powerful agent Jorge Mendes issued a rare statement to dissuade pessimism. ""There have been more rumours of Jose Mourinho leaving Manchester United. It's totally untrue. Jose is very happy at the club and the club is very happy with him,"" said Mendes, whose list of clients includes Cristiano Ronaldo and David de Gea. ""He has a long-term contract and is fully committed to the club in building a solid winning project."" Mourinho was sacked eleven days later.

Most anticipated press conference

David Warner: While a tearful Warner dodged questions regarding his specific involvement in the Sandpapergate that saw him stripped of vice-captaincy, slapped with a 12-month ban and removed from any leadership position with the national side for the rest of his career, a certain Englishman got all he wanted from the press conference. ""I literally stayed up until 1:30 in the morning to watch him cry live on TV. What a pleasure that was,"" said former England keeper Matt Prior, who had many run-ins with the Aussie opener.

Most confounding metaphor

Mauricio Pochettino: Asked to explain the pressures of Champions League football ahead of Tottenham's clash with Inter, Pochettino used a weird bovine analogy to set the moo'd. ""It is like a cow that every day in 10 years, sees the train cross in front at the same time. If you ask the cow, 'what time is the train going to come', it is not going to know the right answer.""

Overshadowing of the year

Naomi Osaka: After a remarkable tournament, Osaka outplayed a 23-time major champion to win her first Grand Slam at the US Open. But the presentation ceremony began amid thunderous boos and her acceptance speech with an apology. Serena Williams' outburst was a longtime coming, after the seeding and catsuit rows. But the timing, after three code violations, was unfortunate. Like Sam Stosur at the 2011 US Open, Osaka's first major victory will be remembered more for Serena's meltdown.

Comeback of the year

Omar Abdullah: A month before his retirement, Gautam Gambhir took to Twitter to chide politicians after the death of Manan Wani -- a research scholar-turned-terrorist. Former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir clapped back. ""This man wouldn't be able to find Manan's home district on a map much less his village & yet he presumes to know what drives young men in Kashmir to pick up the gun. Mr Gambhir clearly knows less about Kashmir than I do about cricket & I know almost nothing.""

Honourable mentions: Vinesh Phogat, Novak Djokovic, Tyson Fury and Tiger Woods.

Life-saving innovation

Halo: Received with skepticism at the start of the season, the ""ugly, annoying"" Halo device won over its harshest critics at the Belgian GP when it saved Sauber's Charles Leclerc from Fernando Alonso's McLaren. ""I have never been a fan of the Halo but I have to say that I was very happy to have it over my head today,"" said Leclerc. ""I felt the impact and looking at the image of my car it is quite spectacular.""

Head-scratching innovation

Bat flip: Big Bash League outdid itself this season after scrapping 'head' or 'tails' of a coin toss for 'hills' and 'flats' of a bat flip. And if you're a seasoned backyard cricketer who would favour 'hills' thinking that the bat will roll over, think again. ""You'd be surprised at the science that's gone into this. It is a specially weighted bat to make sure that it is 50-50,"" said head of BBL Kim McConnie.

Unreal moment of the year

Real Kashmir: Formed four years ago in the aftermath of the deadly Srinagar floods, the club reignited hope of the locals who have been battered by decades of violence in the Valley. In mid-2018, Real Kashmir won the second division league and became the first team from the region to qualify for the I-League. It wasn't the final frontier for Indian football, but when Real Kashmir kicked off the match against Churchill Brothers at Srinagar's TRC Ground, it felt like that. It was the first time a national league match was being played in the Valley. And in a breathtaking backdrop, Real Kashmir - the surprise co-leaders of the league - continued to script their fairytale.

Honourable mention: England win a penalty shootout.

But when the dust settled, Mary emerged as the only one with gold around her neck, a record sixth world title. Spirited performances and favourable judging in their backyard yielded two bronze and a silver, but without Mary, the hosts would have ended with an egg on their face.

The Sharmas, residents of Saraswati Building in Thakur village's Vasant Sagar Complex, made one important change in their life in 2018. Instead of travelling to Bandra or other places for a weekend dinner, they have begun to order food to be delivered at home. It's not the same as a family outing, but the journey from Kandivali (East) to Bandra on a weekend is simply no longer worth the trouble, the tension, the cost of the fuel as hours go by in crawling traffic.

Kamini Sharma (51), head of department at Thakur Vidyamandir High School and Junior College, said the Metro Rail construction work in Mumbai's suburbs has made daily life a true nightmare.

Just getting out from home by car or even on her two-wheeler is really tough, she claimed. While one-and-a-half lanes of traffic on the arterial Western Express Highway (WEH) are barricaded with signboards indicating that Metro work is in progress, the remaining lanes are jammed with honking, angry traffic.

""This is what metro construction work in the city has done. It is good if something will change for the betterment of the common people, but I really hope that the government's deadlines for the work are met. They have promised that by the 2019, work on the Metro-7 will be completed,"" she says, hopeful that the new year holds the promise of slightly easier traffic, even if the Metro Rail itself will not be operational immediately.

The Sharmas live almost adjoining the WEH where construction of Metro 7 (Dahisar East to Andheri East) is underway. Just a little farther away, on the Link Road, construction of Metro 2A (D N Nagar to Dahisar) is underway.

With large sections of these roads barricaded, not only is traffic on these arterial stretches chaotic, but smaller roads also witness long jams with more and more motorists looking for alternative routes. Not only motorist, but families living along these stretches have also complained of noise pollution and dust.

But while civil works are only about 60 per cent complete on both these lines, residents are hopeful -- these lines have a deadline of 2019.

Kamini's daughter Dr Snigdha Sharma (26) is a consultant physiotherapist in Juhu. ""In a city like Mumbai that never stops and where every second is valuable and has a price, travelling on WH has involved long wasted hours. Where earlier people could do a certain journey in say, 25 minutes, a lot of time is being wasted in traffic jams,"" she said.

Snigdha's brother Prarabdh Sharma (22), an IT engineer who works in Vikhroli, rides his bike to work. ""Before the Metro construction began, if I filled petrol worth Rs 100, I could go and return from work. Now, Rs 100 worth of fuel lasts me only one way,"" he said. While he used to get to work in 45 minutes, he now spends 100 minutes riding, sometimes more during peak hours.

Snigdha's fuel expenses have shot up too -- to 1.5 times her earlier budget. ""The government had promised to start two Metro corridors by 2019, but I don't think they will be functional until 2020-2021. But we expect that at some places, the barricading will be removed in 2019,"" said said."

Come the month of Markazhi and in the city of Chennai there is a veritable glut of music and dance programmes. Starting out with a lilt in your step as the season begins, hungrily taking in as much as one can, towards the end, it is not uncommon after days of bleary eyed auditorium hopping to look forward to some quiet and rest.

It is still the start of the season as one takes in bits of the 18th Natya Darshan Conference, titled Kadamba -- The flowering path, mounted by Kartik Fine Arts, savouring the performance aspects of Bharatanatyam, even as innovative minds enquire, interact and debate on where the art form is headed. Curated by Priya Murle, herself a teacher, choreographer and performer, the chosen theme conjures up strong associations of Krishna romancing with the Gopis and Radha under the Kadamba tree in the Vrindavan and Mathura gardens, romantic interludes under the shade of this tree described in Sangam poetry and of course the myriad references in mythology, and ancient paintings of the tree laden with the incessant bloom of leaves and flowers -- the ideal metaphor for natya's everlasting fragrance, amidst inevitable changes.

In the morning hours, at the Forum Art Gallery for the morning's show The Moving Canvas, which, portraying the Nava Rasas or the nine governing moods or states of being, or ""rasas""(aesthetic bliss) evoked through interpretative dance, one sees the intimate gathering of bright eyed, smiling expectant faces of the young dancers blooming in conjeevaram silks and jasmin flowers and jewellery, and one contrasts the crackling air of anticipation all round along with the criticism one hears of Bharatanatyam as an ""outmoded"", ""Brahminised"", ""irrelevant"", ""sanitised"" dance form, out of step with reality. Contrarily, the atmosphere in the Art Gallery represents a people with total faith and conviction in the art form -- passed on to them by their individual gurus, an art which is their passion and their life. Moving river art reflects in its entirety different streams, as the modern paintings all round the gallery show.

Simultaneously, with the dancers presenting fare, building up to an emotional state of being, capturing each mood of this moving canvas through the strokes of his palette was painter Ilango, while cartoonist Biswajit Balasubramaniam echoed the same moods through his art form. As a centre of contemporary art, photography and ceramics, the venue provides for an ideal coming together of different art forms.

Raising the curtain on this journey of Nava Rasa through sringaram, the king of rasas, was (ironically or fittingly), male dancer Sathyanarayana Raju from Bengaluru, a disciple of gurus Narmada and Subhadra Prabhu, proving that art has no gender. In the five to six minute cameos each dancer was featured in, Sathyanarayana's sringar herioned was Draupadi, with the long tresses which played such a predominant role in the Mahabharata -- tresses by which she was dragged to court by Dushasana, with her vow, (leading to the Kurukshetra war), never to put up her hair till it had been anointed with the blood of Dushasana. But here in a romantic interlude, Draupadi is portrayed with the prince she loved best -- Arjuna, lovingly coaxing him to be gentle while combing and putting her hair up in a bun, the tender exchanges and the final snuffing out of the lamp as she gets ready for bed, delicately echoing the sringar messages through the eye expressions of the dancer. Nandini Anand as vocal accompanist with Sruti Sagar on the flute provided evocative musical support.

Sangeeta Iswaran chose to pin her depiction of ""hasyam,"" the mood of mocking laughter and fun, on a straightforward Ninda Stuti, a genre of Indian literature which is replete with compositions wherein the devotee addresses the object of his love and worship in the language of anger and mockery. In this case it is Parvati addressing her Lord Shiva who is, for some unknown reason, annoyed with her. Why this anger against me? (""Yedu ittanai modittaan umakku endanmeedaiyya?"" set to raga Surutti). And like a needle piercing a banana smoothly, she asks ""Have I ever complained about your standing on one leg, dancing, or your going round with a begging bowl asking for alms?"" Did I say anything when you smilingly rendered to ashes the three cities of the three demon powers you destroyed? Nor have I ever complained about your eating raw flesh offered to you as prasad by Kanappa, or about you dancing amidst the ashes in the crematorium grounds? Have I ever mentioned your lack of connections and the fact that you are not even (as Ardhanari) fully male? Parvati's gentle raillery and mockery would suffice as a better response than anger. With her highly vivacious facial expressions and bodily attitudes Sangeeta packs a punch and what was particularly heartening was to see the expressional variety in asking in mock innocence, after each point if she had ever complained about anything. The dancer's abhinaya guru Kalanidhi Narayanan would have been happy at her disciple's presentation.

Compassion has been described in all literature as the greatest of qualities to possess. Dancer Roja Kannan, a senior disciple of Guru Adyar K. Lakshman, in the first part of her presentation used a line from the Papanasam Sivan's Nattakuranji Varnam ""Tamadam seyyade vandarul vai."" entreating the compassionate Lord to grant a glimpse of himself without delay. She chose two incidents to illustrate the mood, the first being of the great devotee of Tiruvorriyur Shiva, who, reduced to such penury that he could not afford to buy oil to feed the burning lamp for his God, decided to cut off his head and feed the lamp with his blood when the compassionate Lord appeared before him and blessed him. She ended with Vallalar's work exhorting compassion as the greatest virtue, for the world of nature, for those stricken by incurable diseases like leprosy and ostracised by society, and for all mankind. While the details in the strands were too many in a very short depiction, the dominant note of compassion was very strongly brought out, with the music also very evocative.

Poetry fears the woman scorned, and so it was in the case of Vidya Subramaniam trained under S.K. Rajarathnam Pillai and Kalanidhi Narayanan, and now based in the States, in her expression of Raudra or anger. Taking recourse to a Javali ""Muttavoddura"" in Saveri, the infuriated nayika keeps at bay the unfaithful suitor who comes to her with his body carrying the signs of dalliance elsewhere. ""Do not touch me,"" she flays the wayward lover . The attitude of the proud nayika, who wants nothing more to do with him, was tellingly brought out, with the attitude of turning her back on him with expressions showing the distaste for all the unmentioned failures and faithless acts. As somebody remarked, fury contains within it shades of derision and disgust too as she shows him the door.

Instead of the one dimensional treatment of Veeram or valour of the martial character defeating foes, one liked the approach to heroism being viewed from the point of moral courage as experienced in the presentation by Bengaluru-based Lakshmi Gopalaswamy trained under Padmini Rao, Narmada and professor M.R. Krishnamurthy. The music too, using Taanam and pure dance passages, was multitoned. Draped in a tiger skin while hiding like a coward inside his palace when danger strikes is not bravery. On the other hand, to acknowledge one's wrong doings, to return ill-begotten gains, to have the moral courage to die for a cause on the battle field is what real courage is about.

Well versed in Sanskrit and Bharatanrittam as a disciple of Padma Subramanyam, the famed Natya Shastra scholar/indologist and author and dancer/choreographer plus musician et al, Gayatri Kanan, who was also groomed in music under N. Rajam, functions currently as principal of Nrithyodaya. For her treatment of bhayanaka or the mood of fear, she depended on her illustrious guru who composed the music and dance. ""Acham, acham, acham."" went the words as Gayatri entered the performance arena casting looks of fear on either side, and made her exit with the same sideways terrified glances. Too much wealth and prosperity carries with it the fear losing it and of having to keep guarding it while fear of poverty conjures up images of living from hand to mouth. Fear as a negative state of mind if allowed to take the upper hand will overshadow the whole of life, sapping it of all happiness. Gayatri's was a presentation of fear and more fear.

Priya S. Dixit, now settled in Singapore running Silambam, an alliance of Shree Bharatalaya her alma mater under her guru professor Sudharani Raghupathy, was given the tricky task of evoking Bibhatsam, a feeling of disgust and revulsion. Her treatment was woven round the figure of Thataka dancing in her unseemly physical girth devouring raw flesh which for a demon is normal fare. The second part painted the entire scene, evoking a feeling of revulsion and disgust in the viewer. A character like Bhima for instance in red hot anger claws out the entrails of Dushasana, but what the gory scene evokes is disgust. Similarly the second part of Priya's treatment showed the feelings aroused while watching Thataka. Wisely realising that this is not a mood which can be held over a long period, she made her narrative brief and muted, without going over the edge.

Representing the Vazhuvur School of her guru K.J. Sarasa and the Vempati school in Kuchipudi as the disciple of latte Vempati Chinnasatyam, Sailaja based her entire treatment of Arbutam, the sense of wonderment, on an Annamacharya Kriti in raga Bouli, ""Oho entati vaade,"" exclaiming at the feats of the Lord in so many manifestations. The lyric refers to some of the dasha avatars, and other aspects like feats of Krishna as Govardhana Giridhari. The dominant state of wonder was paramount.

Shantam or the mood of utter tranquility was not earlier recognised as a mood to be evoked, because that represents the inner stillness and calm from which all dance has to emanate in order to preserve objectivity of what is not a personalised but universalised state of being created through the dance. This rasa was added to what was earlier ashta rasa or eight moods. Sreelatha Vinod a senior disciple of the Dhananjayans chose to base her attempt at evoking the mood on Tyagaraja's wonderful Keertanam ""santamu leka saukyamu ledu Sarasadala nayana"" in the raga Shyama, the most evocative of the mood of tranquility. Addressing the Lotus eyed Lord, the music prodigy states that even the performer of Yagnas, blessed with wife and wealth, and learning in the Vedas and acknowledged as a Bhagavatar, unless blessed with mental peace will never know happiness. And with what a quality of silence in Sreelatha's rendition! It was shantam all the way!

As a finale to the moving canvasses portrayed through expressional expertise, was the snippet shown by Parvathi Ravi Ghantasala groomed under several gurus like Smt. Krishnakumari Narendran, Smt. Kalanidhi Naryanan, and Bhagavatulu Seetaram Sharma. Her presentation of the verse ""Sringaradhra"" saw Parvati looking at Shiva while being overcome by myriad emotions, originating from the deep love (sringaram) she has for him. Each aspect of his get-up stirs in Parvati a certain feeling -- his ash clad body, and matted hair, the snake coiled round his neck, and the Ganga perched in his locks, the fire held in one hand, the other holding the spear and with one hand in the abhaya mudra spelling protection for the world. Parvati experiences all the moods in fleeting vignettes. Parvati as a seasoned dancer, did justice to the mukhabhinaya."

Any writer asked to do a short oped for an year-ender must acknowledge the absurdity of his/her position in times like these. An editorial in the Urdu publication, The Munsif Daily, questions the credibility of the nation's prime investigative agency that has had all the 22 men accused of killing Sohrabuddin Sheikh acquitted, while the judge expressed his helplessness and apologised for the poor evidence that was put before him. Issues like religious tolerance, privacy and independence of institutions are forcing their way into the heart of electoral debates, even as, to our west, a fast unravelling EU drops below the horizon, and, up north, the emerging superpower China struggles with its own problems. Yet, in India, after suffering a humiliating electoral loss in five states, the prime minister addressing a rally in Himachal Pradesh repeats with a tenacity reminiscent of US President Richard Nixon, that he is an ever-vigilant chowkidar who will not spare the thieves. With your blessings, the report quotes him saying to the public, I will not stop this fight.

The vigilant chowkidar faces a tough year that will see the general election decide the face and direction of the central government in 2019. At the end of 2018, when India's fiscal deficit touches 114.8 per cent of the full year target, due to lower than expected tax collections, analysts' predictions for a reduction of deficit or a turnabout in the all but collapsing agrarian economy, are bleak. As Jawaharlal Nehru, much reviled by the BJP, and B R Ambedkar, well understood, progress in the world can at best be incremental. Only the willfully or otherwise ignorant will ignore that the history of nations' progress is simultaneously the history of pain, murder, gross venality, slavery and cyclical horror. No culture is free of it, no community is entirely unstained. The progress in the first seven decades of Independent India may appear small to the ideology of the Sangh, but to those who not so long ago, could not drink from public wells, or marry a person of choice, go to college and compete with men of all castes in all fields, such incremental change has enormous value. In fact, it is the insecurity and sense of alienation of minorities, of women, of tribals and marginal farmers, that in the past few years has deepened, which must be addressed coherently and patiently by whichever political party wishes to come to power.

This writer has inherited both her optimism and sense of despair from a mother who was one of the least politically inclined writers she knew of, but a fierce supporter of her right to write freely. My mother grew up in Shantiniketan and then married into a conservative line of Brahmins, in the process getting to know some of the greatest and also not-so-great minds in her lifetime. All of these made her perceptive of human frailties and strengths. The System failed her many times but she did not lose faith in her country. Even when she was living as a widow all by herself on her meagre earnings from her writings. I am glad she is no longer here to see what are some of the darkest political times India has known. The surrealist song and drama built around electoral rallies and the cheap pamphleteering won the 2014 elections for the BJP and its allies, but it broke the country's spirit that my mother so admired. The losses in the recent assembly elections prove that the core no longer holds. The fabled oratory, rath rallies and sadhu-sant maha-sammelans, too, have lost their initial appeal, even to the religiously-inclined majority community in 2018. The ""relaxed"" one-sided broadcasts to the nation, at the end of 2018, conjure up a scene similar to a Rene Magritte painting, where one end of the canvas touches philosophy, the other, pure farce.

Take the case of Yogi Adityanath, chief minister of Uttar Pradesh. He was paradropped soon after the big win in UP and landed all guns blazing. Soon, he began making the big noise about saving gau mata at all costs. He banned cattle sales to butchers, most of them Muslims. He forbade the use of loudspeakers for azaan, citing the disturbance to public peace. Currently, he has banned namaz being performed in any public park in the state. He has banned beef sales and is planning a large statue of Lord Ram as a sort of precursor to building a temple on what is currently disputed land. Lynch mobs in UP are attacking vehicles on the slightest suspicion of carrying cattle to slaughter houses. Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh followed and, as the beatings of cattle traders grew, soon, practically everywhere, the farmers stopped selling cattle out of sheer terror of being lynched.

Advertising

Now, reports of hordes of abandoned stray cattle entering fields and destroying crops are tumbling in. Last week, in Aligarh, irate farmers rounded up hundreds of such cows and locked them up in a dozen school buildings. The schools were closed and the children (rather happily one suspects) went home. It reminds one of the high farce of Marx Brothers' Horse Feathers (1932):

Groucho: Have we got a stadium?

Faculty: Yes.

Groucho: Have we got a college?

Faculty: Yes.

Groucho: Well, we can't support both. Tomorrow, we start tearing down the college.

Faculty: But Professor, where will the students sleep?

Groucho: Where they always slept, in the classroom.

At this point, Groucho turns to the audience and after watching his brother (Chico) at the piano he reminds the audience, ""I've got to stay here, but there is no reason why you shouldn't go out into the lobby till this thing blows over.""

Were we to be so lucky!"

Every end creates a sense of completion and relief, while every new beginning brings a sense of hope and enthusiasm and so, there is celebration associated with both. The past has made you wiser, the future beckons you to act and it is in the present that you can plan and begin. Although bitter experiences of the past should not prevent you from taking risk and plunging into adventure, one should also not be foolish in repeating old mistakes. A few moments of reflection should become a daily routine to infuse inspiration, innovation and intuition, all of which are much needed for planning and action. In the hustle bustle of daily routine, one tends to lose sight of inner strength or the power of one's own mind. Spending some time with nature and some in introspection, meditating and doing acts of kindness can keep the level of joy and enthusiasm in one's life. Cynicism, which sets in during the course of interaction in society, needs to be checked. It was once considered a fashion of the intellectuals and although in small doses, it can add colour to life, beyond a limit, it poses the danger of engulfing one's own personality and making one miserable. Unfortunately, today we view many of our icons, whether in politics or business, with a cynical mindset. This leads to an atmosphere where higher values in society cannot flourish, innovation cannot happen and the chances of communication breaking down are very high.

When mid life crisis begins in teenage, society is rattled with drug abuse and violence, humanism appears to be utopia, joy, love and compassion remain only in books and on celluloid, corruption and crime appears to be accepted as a way of life, then these are signals for us to rise to meet these challenges in society.

The extension of an individual is a family and the extension of families is a society. We have to address all such problems at the root cause. Transformation in the society can only happen with transformation in the individual. After all, it is only a few sick individuals who cause trauma to the whole society like the person who recently opened fire at little children in an elementary school in the US. While people like this certainly are severely unhealthy, we are quick in blaming them as culprits without seeing the victim inside them. A person causes hurt to fellow human beings because they carry deep hurt within themselves. They end up taking such extreme steps because nobody reached out to them. So, making sure everybody around is happy and emotionally sound becomes our responsibility as well; otherwise, they might harm us or our loved ones out of their frustration. If we have just a few people with such a magnanimous outlook, who can take responsibility for everybody's emotional well-being, society has a very realistic chance of being peaceful and harmonious to a large extent. The very first step to achieve this is education. To me, education is not just collecting information but building a sane and pleasant personality. Aggression and selfishness can be checked by inculcating an attitude of service at a very young age.

There are little things that we can all do to keep our environment stress free. We must develop a habit of sharing our joy with others. If you are happy, infect others with your happiness; don't keep it to yourself. Any action done with this idea behind it is service and the best form of service is uplifting someone's state of mind. Of course, we must be careful and sensitive so as not to upset anyone with our enthusiasm. When we decide to share what we have been given, the Divine showers more abundance on us.

Being spiritual is not turning a blind eye to the world. On the contrary, as you learn more and more about yourself, you come to know more and more about the world as well. A new dimension of looking at everything opens up and you start inferring things which are beyond the obvious. Somewhere within we all want to know who we are, why we are here and what the purpose of life is. Most people choose to overlook these questions as a waste of time. Being spiritual is just keeping this little fire of enquiry alive, not extinguishing it, not giving up the pursuit. These questions serve as a compass and help you bring a sense of direction to your life.

As you pass through events one after the other, realize that life is like a river. There may be stones on the path but the river flows above them. No year passes without a touch of joy or without posing any challenge. One should plan to utilize every moment of joy to serve and see every challenge as an opportunity for growth. 2018 has not brought the end of the world, but 2019 is certainly a new beginning.

In 2019, my personal journey will continue: I am training harder -- and smarter -- than ever, looking forward to more titles and medals as we approach the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. But there are larger uncertainties and questions: What can we do to encourage more women across all spheres, especially in sports? How can India give its best-ever performance at the Olympics? What is it that young girls and women across the nation can learn from my struggles and successes?

Let's first talk about India's prospects at international sports meets in general, with an eye on Tokyo in particular. The first thing sports, particularly those which centre around individual achievement, (and not just the one team game that draws so much attention and resources) needs is more funding. Funds are the first step towards building the infrastructure and expertise that can recognise, nurture and maintain the excellence that is required to perform at the highest level. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), for instance, mandates that schools have a certain infrastructure, that every child in India has access to specific facilities close to their home, in their own locality.

We can look at China and the difference that sports facilities have made to their performance at the international level. What is needed is an SSA-like scheme for sports. All children enjoy playing, and it is this joy that turns into grit and determination. With every child guaranteed the right facilities, they can learn to play and be recognised if they have an aptitude for a particular game at an early age. I remember in my own school days, I began with teaspoon-races and three-legged races! Every game counts. Today, my own children are always playing, they love it and along with their studies, it forms an important part of their overall development.

It is also important for there to be complete coordination between the government and sports federations and unity even within the sports federations themselves. The government, of course, is already doing a lot for sports and its growth. Under the Target Olympic Podium (TOP) scheme, which was instituted by the current NDA government in September 2014, the government is investing considerable funds in promoting talent. To provide an impetus towards an athlete's training, facilities, coaching et al is provided, along with a stipend of Rs 50,000. This is not a small amount. I never earned that much even when I had a government job!

Advertising

In the new year, we must ask for efficiency and accountability not only from the government and sports authorities, but also from the athletes themselves. In a country like India, with limited resources, is it fair that even under-performing persons continue to get such a handsome allowance and facilities?

The stipends and facilities must be performance-linked in sports, as in any other field. This will have multiple positive effects. First, it will ensure that new talent among the younger generation also gets a fair chance and fresh blood is injected into the athlete pool in the country. Second, it will keep those who are receiving the facilities on their toes and not let any kind of lethargy or a lackadaisical attitude to set in. Third, even for those who lose their benefits, it will act as a motivating force for them to perform better.

Another aspect of sports in India that requires attention is the increasingly stellar performance of women. Women are now outperforming men in international events. Clearly, this is an area that the government, as well as all other interested parties, should focus on. Developing the potential of India's girls and women will only lead to more international recognition, which in turn will fuel the growth of sports at home, creating a much-needed virtuous cycle.

In our society, women are often discouraged from performing multiple roles. But to the girls and women of India, I say that you should chase excellence and achievement. Age, marital status, region, religion -- none of this should stand in your way. After being married and having children, I continued to train -- and win -- at the highest level. This required a great effort on my part, I have learnt to listen to my body and mind and find people who when they work with me, understand my way of working. Whatever you do in life, these lessons are important. It is important to step out of the home and follow your dreams and passions. Achievement can only come through hard work. We all have to give ourselves the opportunity to do that work, only then can we scale new heights.

I come from a relatively small community, one which is not particularly wealthy or powerful even in my home state. Yet, today, because of my achievements, I am a nominated member of the Rajya Sabha. I am truly grateful for this opportunity. I can turn to the most powerful and popular people, and tell them with pride that my achievements, my Olympic medal, world championships and all the other titles, are because of hard work and dedication.

In the next year, there will be a general election, which is important for the entire country. My only wish is that it be a fair election, a free one where the will of the people is clearly expressed. After the people elect a government, it must work for the development of the entire nation, as I am sure it will endeavour to do.

I hope that in 2019, I continue to do India proud on the global stage and there are others who are inspired to do the same in all walks of life."

Indeed, it is the most cherishing moment to be able to have seamless access to call, message and to indulge in a myriad activities on the internet for residents of the remote habitation locked by forest in three directions.

Situated around 70 km away from district headquarters, Kondapalli still continues to be deprived of basic amenities such as transportation and communication since its formation way back in 1940s. However, it could find the coverage of mobile phone signals from this December, thanks to the commencement of Reliance Jio service since a few days ago.

Yelkari Sudhakar, former Sarpanch of Kondapalli told 'Telangana Today' that the installation of the mobile tower brought great respite and cheer to the residents of the village who were yearning for the facility for over a decade, particularly since neighbouring habitations were enjoying hassle-free telecommunication. ""We are elated to have the coverage of 4G network,"" he remarked.

With the advent of the new facility, dwellers of this sleepy village, particularly the youngsters are seen glued to mobile phones, using WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube and many other sites. They now don't need to struggle to search for signals by climbing taller houses and school building, trees and by reaching outskirts of the habitation. They would no more be forced to feel isolated.

Significantly, beneficiaries of farm input investment support scheme, Raithu Bandhu and LPG cylinders are able to receive monetary support at their doorstep, without needing to travel 10 kilometres. And, holders of accounts of various banks can easily withdraw funds from their franchises by paying nominal charges.

""Since we had no services of TSRTC bus, we were so far visiting branches of banks in Penchikalapet and Bejjur mandal centres, located at least 10 km by private transit means, for withdrawing funds from an account. Our woes became a thing of past. We are now able to save not only money but precious time,"" T Brahmaiah, a farmer opined."

The year 2018 was marked by tremendous economic and political turbulence around the world. Yet, for future historians, it may well be the year when Africa started to claim its intellectual and economic-policy independence.

The unlikely trigger for what could turn out to be a continent-wide strategic shift was Rwanda's decision to increase tariffs on imported second-hand clothes and footwear in support of its local garment industry. This provoked an immediate hostile response from the US, which suspended duty-free status for Rwandan textile exports under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), America's flagship trade legislation for the continent.

For a small, landlocked African country that relies heavily on trade, this was a big deal. However, the fact that Rwanda held its ground confirmed that times have changed.

If Rwanda is willing to risk preferential access to the American market to develop its domestic garment industry, it must be confident that it will find alternative markets for its exports.

Meanwhile, other African countries have also adopted a more independent attitude vis-à-vis the major trading powers. African governments have increasingly been taking a stand on a wide range of potentially controversial issues, including trade policy in East Africa, land redistribution in Southern Africa, and macroeconomic and debt management policies in North Africa.

African governments' motive for stepping up now is not only economic. It is also about dignity, intellectual freedom, and a willingness to risk charting one's own course. More broadly, African leaders recognize that the ongoing transformation of the global economy means that no country will have enough power to impose its strategic preferences on others, even when they are much smaller, as in the case of Rwanda and the US.

Empirical research from the World Economic Forum (WEF) shows that tariff reductions and market access have become much less relevant for economic growth than was the case a generation ago. Trade is no longer about manufacturing a product in one country and selling it elsewhere. Rather, it is about cooperating across borders and time zones to minimize production costs and maximize market coverage.

The WEF estimates that, ""Reducing supply chain barriers to trade could increase global GDP up to six times more than removing tariffs."" If all countries could bring the performance of border administration, together with transport and communications infrastructure, up to just half the level of global best practice, global gross domestic product (GDP) would grow by $2.6 trillion (4.7%), and total exports would increase by $1.6 trillion (14.5%). By comparison, the complete elimination of all tariffs worldwide would boost global GDP by only $400 billion (0.7%), and exports by $1.1 trillion (10.1%).

Clearly, global value chains are now the dominant framework for trade. As we have seen, African countries such as Rwanda (as well as Ethiopia and Morocco) are already taking advantage of this paradigm shift. Rather than wasting time in unproductive policy discussions over tariffs, they are redirecting their strategies to focus on trade facilitation.

True, today's trade wars have disrupted international supply chains and will continue to do so. However, new constraints will also stimulate creativity and innovation. For example, as Meghnad Desai of the London School of Economics points out, ""In the light of advances in technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence, it is not far-fetched to imagine that businesses could manufacture domestically the intermediate products that they currently import."" In this case, trade would continue apace, ""but the product mix would shift from intermediate to final products.""

Moreover, in an increasingly multipolar world, low-income countries will not have to rely solely on the West for financing and policy ideas, though they will have to be mindful of the risks of indebtedness and precarious governance frameworks. Even as global commerce has undergone a tectonic shift, traditional development thinking, policies, and practices have not.

Meanwhile, as the major emerging economies pursue technological and industrial development to escape the ""middle-income trap"", they are altering the distribution of roles and responsibilities across the global production system. As a result of the economic success of countries such as China, Vietnam, and Indonesia, other low-income economies in Africa and elsewhere now have substantial opportunities to boost employment in labour-intensive industries. After all, China now produces many of the high-value-added goods that once were the exclusive preserve of advanced economies.

As China and others continue climbing the industrial and technological ladder, the necessary relocation of large parts of their supply chains to lower-cost countries will affect the costing and pricing of goods and labour everywhere. However, developing countries can actually use their latecomer status to reap substantial economic benefits. Despite the wildly exaggerated threat of automation, African countries, in particular, can exploit their lower factor costs to promote successful labour-intensive industries in which they have a comparative advantage.

For example, African countries can lower the cost of doing business by building strategically located production clusters and industrial parks, including for green industries. They are also in a strong position to attract foreign direct investment, which brings the positive externalities of technology and know-how transfer, managerial best practices, state-of-the-art learning, and access to large global markets.

If managed properly, this two-pronged approach could provide ample employment for a low-skilled labour force, while rapidly increasing fiscal revenues. This, in turn, would allow for improvements to infrastructure in other areas, thus creating the conditions for long-term prosperity and social stability.

While trade agreements such as the AGOA are still very important to African countries, broader economic and technological changes are opening up new opportunities, and smart policymakers are seizing them.

This is a pivotal moment in north-south relations. After centuries of being politically and intellectually tethered to advanced economies with little to show for it, Africa is striking out on a new path of self-affirmation.

In this quest for prosperity, African leaders and policymakers have proved ready to withstand sanctions, threats, and setbacks. They may not all have read Nietzsche, but they know that what ""does not kill us, makes us stronger"". ©2018/Project Syndicate www.project-syndicate.org"

""Send to everyone in your list. Shame on all 90 Cr Hindus. Ayodhya Ram mandir Babri masjid online voting is going on. Supreme court of India have left the decision to the citizens, But till now there are more votes for Babri masjid. So kindly all Hindus vote for Rammandir to be built in Ayodhya.""

A Hindi version of this WhatsApp message, complete with a voting link, made Sachin Agarwal's phone beep one May morning in 2018. The 30-year-old Faizabad (now Shri Ayodhya) resident read it many times over before he pressed 'delete'.

Later that evening, at a routine meeting of a local traders' association, he discovered that the same message had reached many in the town. Like Agarwal, who lives and works with his businessman elder brother, most of his friends and acquaintances chose to delete the message. It was another matter that the link was a fake one -- as reported in several news publications.

More than seven months later, the same WhatsApp message has resurfaced. With the cry for Ram Mandir growing louder, the timing seems a calculated affair. However, in Ayodhya, less than 7 km from Faizabad, this appeal for votes has evoked little response or interest.

The town is quietly contemplating the burden the upcoming Lok Sabha elections have placed on its shoulders. It is the plank that might decide the fate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government at the Centre. But no one can say what it will get in return.

At the centre of communal and polarisation politics since the 1980s, Ayodhya has lost more to the demand of a Ram Mandir than it can recover. From the time the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) started a movement for the building of the temple, with the aggressive support of the BJP and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), Ayodhya has tried in vain to emerge as anything but a disputed site that divides religious communities.

In December 1992, the town watched in silent trepidation as lakhs of saffron-clad kar sevaks trooped in. And when the Babri Masjid was demolished on December 6, Ayodhya looked as helpless as the police cordon that failed to control the mob at the site. The countrywide riots that followed hit home hard. The name of the town became synonymous with communal strife, despite the fact that Ayodhya hasn't really voted for religion over development.

Ayodhya comes under the Lok Sabha constituency of Faizabad, which is currently represented by BJP MP Lallu Singh. Until 1971, the seat had Congress MPs. It then saw a mix of MPs from the Congress, BJP, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP). And CPI candidate Mitrasen Yadav won the seat in 1989, when the Ram Janmabhoomi movement was at its peak.

Even when it chose a BJP candidate, Ayodhya, with a population of close to five lakh, didn't fall for the mandir-masjid agenda.

""More than anything else, the people of Ayodhya-Faizabad need development -- education, healthcare, better roads and housing, employment, so that we have an identity that is new, modern and untainted,"" says Sharad Kapoor, owner of Shan-e-Awadh, the oldest hotel in Faizabad. Like his two sons, who have returned to Faizabad after higher education to help run the family business, Kapoor refuses to be swayed by the gaining momentum in the demand for Ram Mandir.

He also recognises the appeasement politics behind initiatives such as the renaming of Faizabad and the lavish Deepotsav, a pre-Diwali festival held in the first week of November. The historic ghats of River Sarayu in Ayodhya were given an expensive facelift, dancers and artistes were flown in from several countries, and over three lakh lamps were lit along the river to create a Guinness World Record.

""When we cast our vote, we think only of the future -- with important lessons from the past. We have suffered for letting things happen, we can't afford a repeat,"" Kapoor adds.

Despite Kapoor's firm belief that a religious structure won't break Ayodhya's spirit, the locals are nervously watching the repeated attempts by political parties to hold rallies around or visit the Ram Janmabhoomi. They are also against the fear psychosis that led to some of Faizabad's Muslim families leaving town during Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray's visit in November-end.

Guide Dharmendra Pandey, an Ayodhya resident, doesn't have an issue with having another temple -- his livelihood depends on tourists who pour in to pray at the town's countless temples. But he is aware that some of his neighbours and former school friends, as trainees in tech companies in Gurugram, Noida and Faridabad, earn twice as much as what he takes home after paying a commission to local travel agencies.

Given a choice, Dharmendra -- or his siblings who are also tour guides -- won't visit temples on a daily basis.

But his childhood friend Raja Pandey, employed at a car manufacturing unit in Manesar, Haryana, likes to visit Kanak Mahal and Hanuman Garhi temples whenever he comes home: ""I draw my identity from these temples in Ayodhya. Growing up here, we didn't understand why or how this so-called Ram Mandir is special. If it's so special, maybe it will solve all our problems, and I can then come and live here again,"" Pandey says.

With that hope in heart, he plans to take leave from work in summer 2019, so that he can cast his vote -- his first for Lok Sabha."

Poornima Joshi reports

Neelabh Dubey is a young tax lawyer whose Twitter account recommends the latest works by new-age left-wing economist and former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis. It celebrates Justice S Muralidhar's landmark judgement convicting Congress leader Sajjan Kumar for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by posting a video of the dogged champion of the victims' cases, human rights lawyer H S Phoolka, after the pronouncement.

It would have been difficult to imagine this left-leaning lawyer in the dirt and scum of electoral politics if it wasn't for the testimony -- the manifesto Dubey and a team of spirited party workers produced for the Congress in Chhattisgarh in the just-concluded Assembly elections.

Dubey worked with the Congress veteran TS Singh Deo for over six months, travelling in each district of the tribal State, to listen to one lakh people to produce this document that envisages universal health care, a spurt in State expenditure on health and, of course, steps to boost agricultural income in the years to come.

Driving his personal car to remote areas in Bastar, Dubey's sole focus was to push the Congress's stuttering organisation and cadre base to recognise what he feels should be focus areas for a more pro-poor policy planning.

""It would have been strange even for me to think of working with the Congress. But if we are thinking of change, we cannot just talk about it. We have to work with the existing realities and one of these realities is that we don't have a viable political alternative beyond the Congress and the BJP. I can't imagine working with a regressive force like the BJP so that leaves me with the Congress. And here I am, for what it's worth,"" says Dubey.

A tangible result of this work is the Christmas Eve announcement by the Chhattisgarh government that 1,764.61 hectares of private land, owned by 1,707 tribal farmers in Bastar region that was acquired for a Tata steel project that never took off is now going to be returned to their owners.

""We're not doing them a favour. This is the law of the land. This is what we promised to the people,"" says Dubey, whose singular focus in the coming months is to push the Health Ministry, now under TS Singh Deo's charge, to implement the Universal Health Care model that people so urgently need.

At the dawn of the New Year, which will witness general elections in the summer, the hope and promise that candidate Narendra Modi ignited in his election as Prime Minister in 2014 has seemingly dissipated in his party's loss in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan that sent as many as 62 MPs to the Lok Sabha of the total 65 parliamentary seats in these Hindi heartland States.

But a microscopic look at who and what contributed to this change in the national mood indicates India may still surprise the prophets of doom with its intent to reinvent even a structure so decrepit and symbolic of the rotten state of affairs as the Congress.

Short of churning, there's now a sense of fluidity in the political system, brought upon by a polity that never loses hope.

From the inspired bunch of activists who have thrown their lot for building public education system in Delhi with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)'s formidable duo -- Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and the young firebrand Aatishi Marlena who is set to contest the East Delhi Lok Sabha seat -- to former President of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU)'s student union Sandeep, who is quietly working with the Congress President Rahul Gandhi's team, and Akshay Labroo who was prompted by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman -- with whom he worked as a trainee fresh out of his graduate year from Ramjas college -- into breaking through to the Indian Administrative Service (IAS) this year, politics in India is decidedly being changed by the young and the hopefuls.

They frame the social media discourse and pose certain questions to structured corporate or big business channels who tend to guide mass media and television discourse in a certain direction.

Without an exception, they all believe that Indian elections, including the recent Assembly polls, reflect the common voter's aspiration for a change in status quo and a hope for the future.

2014 was, as BJP leader Sudhanshu Mittal, himself a committed Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activist in his time, told BusinessLine during the last general elections, a ""Year of Hope"" for India.

""Narendra Modi has the hope factor riding with him. You cannot compete against that in India,"" Mittal said.

The country decidedly voted against the Congress but it also voted positively for Modi's promise of Achche Din, earning the BJP a majority in the Lok Sabha, the first time for a government in three decades. The PM carried this momentum into successive elections in Haryana, Maharashtra and Jharkhand where the BJP swept to power soon after the Lok Sabha elections in 2014.

And then came Arvind Kejriwal whose promise of change swept out the Congress and reduced the BJP to just three seats while the AAP won a staggering 67 out of 70 seats in the Delhi Assembly elections in February 2015, just months after the Lok Sabha polls.

Nitish Kumar's track record in governance, coupled with Lalu Prasad Yadav's caste arithmetic, again broke the Modi spell to bring the Mahagathbandhan to power in Bihar Assembly elections later in 2015. In all these elections, the ebb and flow of hope floated with the leader who showed a promise for the future.

If the young participants in the dynamic process that is direct elections are to be believed, what transpired in the December 2018 Assembly polls is a reflection of the popular disenchantment with the promise of Achche Din and guiding of the discourse towards issues of livelihood and economy.

People have spoken, says the suave Raghuvendra Mirdha, a graduate of the London School of Economics (LSE) who quit an international commodity trading company to join his famous grandfather Ramniwas Mirdha's party, the Congress, in Rajasthan. He says that issues such as rural distress, prices of farm produce, erratic MGNREGA payments and glitches in Aadhaar-linked benefit transfers have propelled voter behaviour against identity politics, cow slaughter and Ram temple in Ayodhya, being pushed by the BJP.

In the face of discontent with the Centre's policies and the vast difference between what Modi promised in 2014 and what has actually been delivered on the ground, the BJP is ""fishing in the past -- 1984 riots, Ram temple, cow slaughter -- and the Congress is struggling to find a new narrative"".

Mirdha is uncharacteristically candid for a Congressman and scathing in his review of his party's performance in the desert State. ""If we are to show a mirror to the BJP in the general elections, we have to analyse our performance in Rajasthan minutely and do more than farm loan waivers,"" says Mirdha.

The Congress, says this no-nonsense former international commodity trader, will have to work much harder than they are presently doing to trounce the formidable resource and muscle machinery of the BJP.

""The BJP may be irresponsible and misleading people with all this talk of cow slaughter and identity issues but are we better? That is the question that the Congress will have to answer to the people. The downslide of the BJP will tell you that Indian voter is wise and cannot be misled. The Congress has to rise to that challenge,"" says Mirdha.

As the BJP and its ideological affiliates, especially the VHP and the RSS, start plumbing the Ram Mandir politics along with cow slaughter, triple talaq and anti-Pakistan nationalist rhetoric in the hope of whipping up communal polarisation in the general elections, worry is writ large on the faces of the ruling party's key strategists.

""Bhagwan bharose hai (It is all up to God),"" says a senior BJP leader and Union Minister who believes the party's credibility on issues of governance and delivery is at an all-time low.

""Sugarcane arrears are mounting up to over ₹6,000 crore in Uttar Pradesh alone. I still believe we are better placed than the Congress... Let us see what happens. Farm distress is worrisome,"" says the BJP leader.

Observes former Karnataka chief minister and the chairman of Finance Standing Committee of Parliament, Veerappa Moily: ""The theme for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be agriculture and farmers. For rural India, it's not digital economy. It is a cash economy. Farmers sell their crops, take cash and use it for their children's education, marriage, healthcare, etc. Now they feel totally suffocated. They don't get money in their hands when they sell their crops. Payments are delayed. Demonetisation created a new vicious cycle. Even today, money is not available. Even the cooperative banks' money, which is farmers' money, was seized. They destroyed economy. Migrant labourers had to go back to their villages. Unemployment increased. MSMEs are in bad shape. The only beneficiaries were middlemen and black money hoarders.""

The Prime Minister, a feisty campaigner to the last, has already started attacking the Congress on its imminent failure to deliver on the farm-loan waiver promises.

The Congress has its unflattering legacy, which can always be flogged by the Opposition.

The year will once again test the voter's native wisdom on the face of campaign by the BJP on emotive issues and the Congress's tenuous appeal to its traditional constituency of rural poor, tribes, Muslims and jobless youth with more welfarism and opening up of the State purse. The fireworks have only just begun."

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

The whereabouts of 28 people have been established but the fate of nearly 70 was unclear. National television said some 50 people could be trapped under the rubble.

National television broadcast footage of rescue workers combing through mangled heaps of concrete and metal in temperatures of minus 18 Celsius (minus 0.4 F).

Temperatures in Magnitogorsk were expected to plunge to minus 23 Celsius on New Year's night, the biggest holiday of the year in Russia.

Officials warned that two more sections of the Soviet-era high-rise on Karl Marx Street were in danger of collapsing.

Local resident Anna Koroleva told Echo of Moscow radio that the explosion shattered windows of nearby buildings.

The Kremlin said President Vladimir Putin had been ""immediately notified of the tragedy in Magnitogorsk"".

'Common tragedy'

Located in the mineral-rich southern Ural region, Magnitogorsk, with a population of more than 400,000 people, is home to one of the country's largest steel producers.

The high-rise was built in 1973 and was home to around 1,100 people. Residents were evacuated to a nearby school.

Volunteers offered money, clothing and essentials to the victims, and some said they were ready to provide temporary shelter to those in need.

Regional governor Boris Dubrovsky said authorities planned to buy apartments for people who had lost their homes.

Staff from the local Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (MMK), one of the country's largest steelmakers, took part in the rescue operation.

Billionaire Viktor Rashnikov, who controls the plant, called on city residents to help the victims.

""This is our common tragedy and pain,"" he said in a statement, adding that MMK would provide financial assistance to those in need.

Investigators opened a criminal probe into the accident, with the FSB security service confirming the blast had been the result of a gas explosion.

Such deadly gas explosions are relatively common in Russia where much of the infrastructure dates back to the Soviet era and safety requirements are often ignored."

Though 2018, young with expectations and hope for development, began on a slow and steady note with projects like the Kochi Water metro and Smart City receiving a boost, tragedy struck by the middle of the year, after a school van carrying pre-school children of a playschool fell into a temple pond at Ayani in Maradu.

This was to be the first among the many disasters Ernakulam would witness in the coming months.

Hardly a month later, Kerala woke up to another rude shock, the death of SFI member and Maharaja's College student Abhimanyu, which sparked state-wide protest and unravelled a story of political vendetta.

Migrant labourers were brought under the scanner after 22-year-old Nimisha, a native of Malayidamthuruthu, was hacked to death in Perumbavoor.

And even as Kochi prayed for brighter days, bad times came visiting again after Independence Day, when heavy rains led to flooding, rendering many homeless and looking for shelter in relief camps. Homes in Aluva, Paravoor, Varapuzha went underwater spiralling peoples lives out of control.

If that was not enough, the factional feud began rearing its ugly head in municipalities in and around Ernakulam. The nuns' protest demanding the arrest of Jalandhar Bishop Franco Mulakkal gained prominence at Vanchi Square in High Court.

Another nail in the coffin was the death of Ebin Paul an IT professional, a native of Kochi in October, who was killed in a road accident along the pot-hole ridden Kakkanad-Palarivattom route. Yet, despite the tragedies, Kochi did have its share of positive moments.

The Cochin International Terminal attained the one crore passenger benchmark this year while authorities also opened its renovated domestic terminal on a budget of Rs 240 crore. The water metro received a boost while eight small bridges connecting tiny islands under the Goshree Islands Development Authority (GIDA) at an estimated cost of Rs 38.40 crore were thrown open to the public.

The much-anticipated City Gas Pipeline project gathered steam. Adding to Kochi's bag of happiness was the 'conditional permission' granted by the city council to Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd (RJIL) for digging up roads to laying optical fibre cable(OFC) and drawing overhead lines for their ambitious project.

The Kochi Muziris Biennale also took off on December 12.

Student politics play spoil sport

The murder of 20-year-old Abhimanyu, a BSc Chemistry student of Maharaja's College, cast a pall of gloom on nearly all college campuses It brought to light the intrusion of fanatics into educational institutions. Debates raged over the validity of campus politics. This was also the year which saw two women vice chancellors stepping down from their offices after a successful and fruitful stint. J Letha of Cusat and Rose Varghese of NUALS, proved to tough nuts when it came to making their institutions premier ones.

The rains, bandhs and hartals wreaked havoc on the academic calendar in 2018. The playschool van accident at Maradu led to the death of three including two children. Guidelines to be followed by the schools with regard to school buses and vans were drawn. However, it was not all that bad for the education sector. The year saw a spike in the number of admissions in government schools. Around 1.85 lakh students had sought admissions in government schools all over the state and the numbers were significant enough in the district too.

Kochi metro gets a push

The Kochi Metro, which is now an integral part of City's transport sector, focused on brand building activities mainly in 2018 along with launching some key steps in connection with Water Metro, the formation of Unified Metropolitan Transport Authority (UMTA) and second phase expansion of the Metro to Kakkanad. It also actively associated the flood relief activities. The KMRL conducted free services thereby helping the rescue workers to reach Aluva and supply relief materials. The agency also The reconstruction of Champakkara bridge was also launched along with the preparatory work at Petta- SN Jn stretch

Sorrow of motorists

City roads turned death traps this year. Ebin Paul's death along the pot-hole ridden Palarivattom-Kakkanad route shocked the collective conscience of the city. Officials, who were till then in a state of apathy, woke up from their slumber. The inaction of the authorities catapulted protests. It was the private bus owners, backed by organisations like the Kerala Private Bus Operators Association, who first threatened to suspend services in the route.

Fall of the football hype

A host of events kept Kochi busy in the year that passed by even though Kerala Blasters, the city's most high-profile team, endured a torrid time. Blasters suffered their worst run in ISL history, with popular coach David James facing the axe last week. It followed the fans' boycott of the last three matches. But the football fans were treated to some quality action earlier in the year when Spanish premier league club Girona and Australian Melbourne City played friendlies with Kerala Blasters.

Year of factional feuds

The Congress party has become synonymous with factional feuds. Local bodies such as Thrikkakara, Kochi Corporation, Kalamassery Municipality and Maradu Municipality witnessed a year of ugly politics too. In Kalamassery municipality, Jessy Peter had to step down after KPCC helped the Congress I faction oust her from the post and appoint Rukiya Jamal, wife of former chairperson Jamal Manakadan, as the new chair. At Thrikkakara municipality, the LDF once again came to the front with the Congress rebel Sheela Charu shifting to the LDF and becoming elected as chairperson. However, the factional feud in the Congress party at Corporation reached nowhere, though a section of Congress workers pushed for Shiny Mathew as the Mayor candidate.

Floods

Aluva, Kalamassery, Paravoor, Angamaly were the constituencies which bore the major brunt of the floods in Ernakulam. Lakhs of people were shifted to relief camps. The Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL) at Nedumbassery, was shut down due to flooding for several days. Approximately 2 lakh people were displaced in Paravoor alone, as 60,000 homes were inundated in the aftermath of the floods, said Paravoor MLA V D Satheeshan. The livelihood of agricultural and dairy farmers weavers, fishermen went for a toss. The Chekutty doll from Chendamangalam rose as the symbol of resilience.

Upbeat health sector

At least 300 cases of leptospirosis resulting in two deaths broke out in the district post-floods. H1N1 cases also reared its ugly head. The silver lining, however, was the introduction of the Ernakulam District Comprehensive Cancer Control Programme aimed at the early detection of cancer. On the infrastructure front, new blocks are under construction at the General Hospital, Ernakulam Medical College and Cochin Cancer Research Centre. The year also marked the fifth anniversary of the government takeover of Ernakulam Medical College. ""Despite the floods, the quality and availability of health care remained stable. This year, we also received a major boost in the implementation of Ardram project,"" said Dr N K Kuttappan, DMO, Ernakulam."

Speaking to Tamil daily Dinathanthi, GK Reddy has confirmed that Vishal will have his engagement with Anisha in January.

What does Sara Ali Khan have that her other contemporaries don't? We are not talking about genetically blessed looks, royal legacy, access to high profile designers, star parents and a string of advantages that a star kid claims. She is undoubtedly gorgeous and her elegant demeanour speaks of her royal lineage but the most significant trait that puts her above the rest is her free-spirited self that we all got to see on talk shows, interviews and events. The humble star is finally here who is not categorised and claimed under a certain cinematic genre, a style signature and a predicted career graph. Sara is as real as it gets and she exudes newness, untamed charm and she seems like one of us.

An alumnus of Columbia University Sara Ali Khan reminds us of the unmatched confidence and fierceness that her mother Amrita Singh possessed when she entered the film industry. In terms of style, Sara is versatile and she is open to all kinds of fashion experiments. From sporting print on pattern to mini dresses, jumpsuits to retro metallics, traditional silhouettes to graphic prints, the starlet is not ready to be claimed by one particular signature. There is a sense of individuality and youthful exuberance to her persona and the sense of originality and grace she wears is the ultimate guide to stand out anywhere and everywhere.

She is the face of the modern millennial who is uninhibited by realities of life and she has no qualms about being who she is and the chip on the shoulder hasn't appeared so far. Her signature seems to the perfect balance of classic and contemporary and she is not trying to be someone. She is being herself, sorted and open to challenges and unknown possibilities. We also saw a comeback of certain patterns on Sara like the dhoti pants, billowy sleeves, busy prints and easy hairdos. The make-up has been natural and non-pretentious and that smile goes a long way. Her style statement doesn't seem to be guided by a particular school of thought and she is innovative unlike the new bunch of actresses who have lost to persuasive demands of image building and glamour Nazis. The comfort, the fearless responses, unguarded body language adds up to her contented presence on and off the screen.

There is a certain sense of exclusivity that Sara brings on the table and we would like to see more of her, listen to her evolving sense of films, relationships, style, sense of being and how to be humble and survive the magnitude and impulsiveness of celluloid."

In 1969, Bengali director Mrinal Sen made his ninth movie, his first in Hindi. Funded by Film Finance Corporation, the predecessor to the National Film Development Corporation, Bhuvan Shome charts the encounters between a strait-jacketed bureaucrat (Utpal Dutt) and Gouri (Suhasini Mulay), whom he meets during a birding trip in Saurashtra. It is among Sen's best-known and best-loved works. Here are edited excerpts about the making of the film and its reception from Sen's memoir Always Being Born.

In many ways, Bhuvan Shome was new to us. It was my first film in Hindi, Utpal Dutt acted for the first time in Hindi, never before Suhasini Mulay acted in cinema, not even on stage or in her school. Vijay Raghava Rao made music for the first time in a feature film and so did KK Mahajan's photography make its debut in a feature film. And interestingly, Amitabh Bachchan made his first earning in cinema by lending his voice for the voice-over in bits. He was most reluctant but I persuaded him to accept a cheque. The amount was 300 rupees. The total cost of the production was unbelievably low, lower than the unbelievably lowest - 2,00,000 rupees! Two lakh, just two! After all, what we were planning to make was a low-budget film and set a record! And a trend!

Given a 'blank cheque', answerable to no one, not even to any of the official agencies, the entire team of workers was bubbling with 'infantile' enthusiasm, as though a group of children had been given plenty of building blocks to play with. In a highly conformist set-up as ours, it was sheer delight on our part to rush into a world of madness. Madness, true, but we saw to it that there was method in our madness - skill and inherent discipline.

An instance. We came to a sequence - the tough bureaucrat back to his own world! Frankly, I did not quite understand how to get to grips with the scene. Back to his own world, he would be a figure of ridicule, not a figure of fun. I looked at Utpal (Dutt), I went to him and took him aside. Then, recalling my own past as a medical representative, I told him that funny story of mine at Jhansi hotel in 1951 - how I shut myself inside the hotel room, how I stood before the mirror, stripped myself, stood naked, made faces, shouted madly, and how finally I broke down, cried with convulsive sobs and why, three days later, I resigned.

Dutt did not speak a word. He looked deep into me and pressed my hand.

""Give me just ten minutes,"" he said, and hurriedly left the room.

Then, juxtaposing images and sound, all that happened to Bhuvan Shome in the film was his tragic realisation that he would remain the same as he had been all these years - a duty-bound tough bureaucrat, a lonely prisoner trapped within the four walls his office with heaps of files to come and go - and with the phone ringing unceasingly. What we did at the end, Dutt and I, was to grant the man a touch of insanity and allow him to temporarily escape into a kind of burlesque and 'inspired nonsense'.

A few private screenings went extremely well. As a result, to find a good theatre in my city for commercial release was not difficult. However, the attendance in the first show was much less than adequate. The manager, one Daruwala, was sceptical about the fate of the film. We felt frustrated. Hoping against hope, we were waiting outside. The show was over, the crowd rushed to the foyer, they identified me, they mobbed me, all of them. I was greeted by a storm of praise. The rush was unmanageable. It was maddening. I was bewildered.

Widely circulated, the film was discussed at various levels in most of the metropolitan cities, but the interpretation was not the same, differing from person to person. The varying interpretations baffled me at times and also helped me to discover myself. The dominant view was that the film was to tame a bad bureaucrat. Others had other views. To cite just one case, one particular group of my European friends was convinced that Bhuvan Shome was a lovely, erotic film. An eminent critic and historian in India, Daneswar Nadkarni, had an identical view and even pointed out erotic motifs in his long essay in The Times of India. The Press, by and large, branded the film as belonging to New Wave variety, not my admission, for sure. Not mine, to repeat. As far as we were concerned, in a desperate drive, we ran wild and made a film. De-emphasising plot and incident, we told a human story - within the framework of a simple storyline. All done on location, made within a throwaway budget. And that was all!

Interestingly, one who reacted rather unwholesomely was Satyajiy Ray who, when a big noise was raised over the film, came out with a long essay. It was later included in an anthology, Our Films, Their Films. It was all about New Wave, brilliantly written and analysed with superb mastery, saying what it was all about. But, in conclusion, he added a small paragraph - a kind of appendix - on Bhuvan Shome, never mentioned earlier in his meaningful essay. I drop an excerpt:

Among recent films, Bhuvan Shome is cited widely as an offbeat film, which has succeeded with a minority audience. My own opinion is that whatever success it has had has not been because of, but in spite of its new aspects. It worked because it used some of the popular conventions of cinema, which helped soften the edges of its occasionally spiky syntax. These conventions are a delectable heroine, an ear-filling background score, and a simple, wholesome wish-fulfilling screen story. Summary in seven words: Big Bad Bureaucrat Reformed by Rustic Belle.

I refrain from unnecessarily writing a long rejoinder because it is rather inconsequential. I say just a few words on his summarisation in seven words (Hollywood's one-time criterion of a good screen story): Big Bad Bureaucrat Reformed by Rustic Belle.

My business, to write in plain and simple language, was not to reform the bureaucrat because he belonged to an incorrigible tribe. Bhuvan Shome, as I saw him on the screen, was an arrogant man, lonely and sad, who finally came to a tragic realisation, burlesque and tragic nonsense acting as façade.

Or, it could as well have been the usual conventional viewing when the viewer had a grown a propensity for wishing a bad man turning good at the end. Responding to stock responses! Wish-fulfilling screen story!

Once, by taxi, I had a long ride in Bombay. The driver, a never-ending chatterbox, kept talking about everything under the sun. That was the peak hour and it was my turn to ask him a question. Had he seen a film, now running? Bhuvan Shome? About birds and a girl? Yes, he had seen it. A 'class' film! And suddenly he pulled the brake, stopped the taxi, turned and looked at me.

'Are you Mrinal Sen, Sir?"" he asked, wonder struck.

I needed. He stretched out his hand. We shook hands, a warm shake. The taxi stood still. All in a split second. Behind the taxi, so many cars, honking, all at a time. The taxi was on the move again. Another ten minutes or so to reach my destination. But no further speech, not a single word from him...! The taxi arrived.

The strangest thing of all that happened, he simply refused the fare for the long drive."

Delhi's oldest Ghazipur landfill and Asia's largest dumping ground - Deonar in Mumbai, continued to gather waste despite the Supreme Court ordering a closure of these landfills. Meanwhile, Delhi's biggest garbage dump- Bhalswa landfill caught fire that took three days to douse. Recently, Mumbai's second largest dumping ground - Mulund landfill was permanently closed after it reached its saturation point and then there was the fire at Ahmedabad's sole landfill site at pirana, where fumes emitting from garbage are a common sight for passersby.

While landfills continue to be an eyesore in the urban landscape and a crisis that most cities are grappling with, there were a few notable exceptions - Indore, and Ambikapur that declared themselves landfill free and emerged as benchmarks that others can follow.

According to the Central Pollution Control Board report of 2015-2016 which have the last collated figures on the implementation of Solid Wastes Management Rules, 2016, over 1.3 lakh (1,35,198.27) tonnes of solid waste is generated per day in India. Of the total waste generated, while over one lakh tonnes per day (1,11,027.55 TPD) is collected, only a fraction - 25,572.25 TPD is treated and 47,415.62 TPD is landfilled.

To make sure cities go waste free, government also introduced seven star-rating under Swachh Survekshan - a pan India exercise to assess cleanliness in urban India. The seven star rating is the first-of-its kind rating tool for assessing cleanliness of cities and towns in India, designed on a SMART approach that stands for Single metric, Measurable, Achievable, Rigorous verification and Targeted towards outcomes. The criteria to achieve seven star rating is 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, 100 per cent waste treatment and waste free local water bodies.

The Current Status: The national capital Delhi is home to three of the biggest landfills namely Ghazipur, Okhla and Bhalswa, which have out lived their life and are now unable to take the burden and collapsing under the weight of the waste. A fact that is borne out by the recent events with the Ghazipur dump yard collapsing in 2017, claiming two lives and Bhalswa and Okhla landfill smouldering continuously. The sad part is, despite all this, little to nothing has been done in 2018 to improve the status of landfills with 60-70 metre high mountain of garbage.

All kinds of waste that is wet, dry and toxic is collected together and dumped at a landfill. Once wet waste starts rotting and decomposing then you have formation of methane gas which is not only a toxic greenhouse gas, but flammable also. Because of the same, landfills are always under fire. It is just sometimes it is huge and someone passing sees it, makes a video and posts it on social media and it becomes news, says Chitra Mukherjee, Head of Programmes, Operations, Chintan.

""In Delhi, till date, about 10,500 tonnes of waste is collected per day. 6,100 TPD still goes to waste to energy plant and this is all mixed waste. Only 200 TPD gets composted"", says Swati Singh Sambyal, Programme Manager, Waste Management, Center for Science and Environment.

The Problem: Currently, a portion of collected waste is dumped at some or the other landfill and remaining is treated at waste-to-energy (WTE) plants at Sarojini Nagar, Narela-Bawana, Ghazipur and Okhla. But are these WTE plants effective? Will they solve the problem?

Municipalities keep talking about WTE plants, but honestly they are pathetic, because all kinds of waste goes into it and is burned. WTE plants are neither meeting emission norms, nor helping in waste segregation and then recycling, says Chitra.

The problem in Delhi is lack of accountability and enforcement of Solid Waste Management Rules (SWMR) of 2016. It has been two years and not even single law has been implemented so far, reason being, as East Delhi Municipal Corporation says, lack of funds to provide vehicles and other necessary things to waste pickers. As part of SWMR, waste should be segregated at source and if not then defaulters will be penalised, but according to experts, not even single case has been registered.

Also Read: Swachh India: Guide To Solid Waste Management Rules 2016

Segregation of waste at source ensures that biodegradable waste like kitchen waste is composted, waste like plastic that can be recycled is sent to relevant facilities and only what remains make it way to the landfill. Unlike now where bulk of the waste is piling up at these landfills.

The Solution: To deal with the humoungous amount of waste, earlier this year Supreme Court asked Lieutenant Governor of Delhi to form a committee and come up with solutions. A 24 member team comprising children, civil society members, RWA (Resident Welfare Association) representatives, municipalities and others was formed and the committee is expected to submit its report in the first week of 2019.

Also Read: Despite New Waste Management Rules, Delhi's Ghazipur Landfill Grows 15 Metres In A Year

The committee is of the opinion that effective enforcement of SWMR of 2016 will help in managing the waste and making municipalities accountable. Being a member of the committee, Chitra knows the on ground issues and says,

The problem is citizens do not connect their responsibility with the landfill. Lot of people complain that we segregate waste at home, but waste pickers mix it. So, who is at fault? Of course, the municipalities as they do not have a dedicated stream for segregated waste.

For remediation that is to stop the environmental damage being caused by Bhalswa landfill, lifespan which lapsed in 2009 and yet it continues to be in use a decade later, a nine member Scientific Advisory Committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of Dr. Manoj Dutta, Professor, IIT Delhi. According to the committee's recommendation, adoption of landfill mining (process of excavating landfilled solid wastes and processing it) is not a viable option. In the first stage, the committee has asked the municipal corporation to carry out site characterisation under which it needs to collect data on the quantum of waste under and above the ground, type and quality of waste, and other parameters for assessing the current state of the landfill. Once it is done, the nine member committee will prepare the design of the work to be done at the Bhalswa landfill site. While the investigation and design of the project is under progress, execution of plan is scheduled for March 31, 2020 which is still one and a half years from now. If that works well, similar steps can be taken for Ghazipur and Okhla landfill, maybe.

The Experts Opinion: Talking about the steps taken in 2018 and the way forward to deal with active volcanos in the city, Chitra says,

Nothing has happened in 2018, apart from passing the buck. With the committee submitting its report to the apex court, we hope municipalities to take some action in 2019, implement waste segregation, and especially SWMR.

The Current Status: Maharashtra's capital Mumbai is a densely populated city that generates 7,000 metric tonnes of waste per day that directly goes to two dumpyards - Deonar (holding city's waste from over 9 decades) and Mulund and to scientific landfill - Kanjurmarg. After observing the condition of the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds and noting how they have reached their saturation points, in February 2016, the Bombay High Court had ordered the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to close down the two dumping grounds. It is in October this year that Mulund dumping ground was finally closed permanently, but Deonar continues to function way past its lifespan.

There is no such saturation point for landfills. As far as Deonar is concerned, there is still some space as we have started processing waste and have more plans to manage the waste effectively in the days to come, says BMC official.

While bio-mining and capping (a containment technology that forms a barrier between the waste and the ground, shielding humans and the environment from the harmful effects of its contents) is being practised at Mulund landfill, bio-reactor (under which liquids are added to help bacteria break down the waste) and composting has been adopted at Kanjurmarg. But the question is, are these solutions sufficient and effective?

The BMC's Opinion: ""The process of bio-reactor is useful for mixed waste as well, so the good thing here is we don't have to pay heed to waste segregation. But it is not that we are ignoring waste segregation at source"", says BMC official.

With increase in waste load, BMC plans to increase the processing of waste at Kanjumarg by March end. The plan is to treat upto 5,800-6,000 metric tonnes of waste at Kanjurmarg and leave only 1000-1200 metric tonnes per day at Deonar.

While 5,000 tonnes will be treated via bio-reactor, 1,000 tonnes will be composted. We are strengthening the segregation activity which will further reduce the total generation and load on Deonar, says BMC official.

The Problem: Until October, of all the waste generated, 1400-1500 metric tonnes was dumped at Mulund dumping ground, every day. Now the same waste is being shared by Deonar and Kanjurmarg landfill, increasing the waste burden on already overstretched landfills. Deonar which expired back in 2009 is still being used recklessly and the result is constant fumes emerging from garbage, leading to instances of fires.

Though BMC has plans to treat waste on a daily basis, but what comes up as a major problem is the legacy waste. Lack of waste segregation at source comes up as another issue as without segregation the amount of waste reaching the landfills cannot be reduced.

The Solution: As experts say, decentralised process and segregation is the key to manage the mammoth waste and BMC is currently focusing on segregation. Shedding light on the same, BMC official says,

We have floated the tender, asking for vehicles with compartments to collect the segregated waste. 40 per cent of the requested vehicles are already in action and the remaining will be up soon. This will of course ease the entire process as dry waste will further get segregated into e-waste, plastic, paper, and others and treated accordingly.

Steps Taken By BMC In 2018: BMC has made it mandatory for bulk generators to treat wet waste at source. The ones failing to do so will be penalised as per the law. For residents and small scale waste generators, awareness camps, exhibitions and activities are being organised. People are being educated about the process of wet waste management at home and encouraged to practice the same.

Until and unless waste generators take the responsibility, we cannot do much. If at home you will segregate the waste, it will be easy for us to treat it as centralised processing centers cannot segregate the 7000 tonnes of waste. It has to start from your own home, building, society and colonies, says BMC official.

The Experts Opinion: ""I agree that waste generators need to take action, but decentralised process is pivotal. Like authority cannot lie in an individual's hand, entire waste cannot be managed in one way. Different kinds of waste need to be treated in different way and for the same we need different strategies"", says Chitra.

Earlier in 2013-2014, the waste load on dumping ground in Mumbai used to be 9,400 tonnes which has now come down to 7,000 tonnes and BMC further plans to bring it down to 6,000 tonnes. Can this be achieved? Given the scale of the crisis, the city sure will have its fingers crossed.

Bengaluru, the IT capital of India, is infamous for its garbage crisis and holds the title of 'garbage city of India'. A city with a population of 1.23 crore generates 4,000 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis. The waste is majorly categorised into dry, wet and sanitary waste. While the dry waste is collected and taken to 164 dry waste collection centers, wet waste is sent to eight processing units, together capable of treating 2,300 tonnes per day and sanitary waste is being treated by a private company.

Along with this, we have organic waste converter (treatment and recycling of solid and liquid refuse material) of capacity 1500 tonnes. 30 per cent of apartments in the city are doing composting on site. Also, we have a learning center where we give lessons on how to do composting, manage waste and other things. Main aim is to encourage waste segregation at source, Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, Solid Waste Management, Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).

As far as mixed waste is concerned, it is simply dumped at scientific landfill - Bellahalli in the city, which came into existence around three years ago. In November, the orders were given to close Bellahalli landfill within 90 days, but civic body has decided to use the landfill for six more months and then convert it into a motor racing track. As part of the functioning of scientific landfill, currently, at frequent intervals, waste is covered with a thick layer of mud.

Earlier the city of Bengaluru was known as the garbage city, but today we are proud to say that this tag does not belong to us, Sarfaraz Khan.

The reason Mr Khan proudly says this is how in past a quarry turned into landfill was transformed into a beautiful park. Few years ago, the stone quarry at Bagalur was abandoned, after which it had become a dangerous spot due to the 200 feet deep pit. Slowly and gradually, the site turned into a dumping ground, raising concerns among villagers. It is three years ago, BBMP noticed the site and claimed it for a scientific landfill site. The scientific landfill would intake 300-400 tonnes of mixed waste everyday. After every 8 - 10 feet of garbage, 8 feet of mud capping was given. This way, by August 2017, quarry was filled and saplings of neem and amla and flowering plants like crotons were planted on it.

BBMP has done a lot in 2018 to improve waste management in the city. There is a new 'Swachagraha Kalika Kendra', a composting learning center for home and community, Bengaluru is the only city to collect sanitary waste separately, black spots are being cleaned. A lot has been done, but there is still a long way to go. We have infrastructure and policies, but what is lacking is the implementation and streamlined waste collection system. I feel citizens working with officials and elected representatives makes a good combination and together they can solve the crisis, says Nalini, co-founder, Hasiru Dala.

Madhya Pradesh's Indore has managed to grab the title of India's cleanest city for two years in a row. To maintain the lead in Swachh Survekshan 2019 as well, the city took some stringent steps this year with regards to waste management. From implementing 100 per cent door-to-door waste collection, source segregation, scientific land filling, to eliminating decade old waste from landfills, the city has done it all. It is not just focusing on treating household waste, but plastic and construction and demolition waste management as well.

Indore city generate 1100 metric tonnes of waste per day and we cannot leave this enormous amount of waste just like that. To manage the waste, a decentralised waste treatment system exists at each and every hospital, school, RWA, and other such places which make waste treatment possible at source only. The waste which is not treated goes to centralised waste treatment system handled by IMC and there it is taken care of, says Asad Warsi, Swachh Bharat Mission Consultant.

20 metric tonnes of waste generated in fruit and vegetable mandi (market) is used to power its public transport buses. A bio-mechanisation plant is installed in the market which ends up generating three types of gases from the waste generated in the fruit and vegetable market - Methane, Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S). Methane is separated, cleaned, purified and compressed and then converted into bio CNG which can fuel 20-25 buses every day.

Can waste generate wealth? Yes, as ambikapur proves it by earning lakhs. Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur has a population of 1.45 lakh and generates 52 metric tonnes of waste on a daily basis, but instead of dumping it on some or the other dumpyard, the city converts waste into wealth and makes Rs. 20-25 lakh per month.

In the year 2015, the municipal corporation made it compulsory for citizens to segregate the waste at source. Since then, every morning, 447 sanitation workers go out, collect the segregated waste which is further segregated at 17 secondary segregation centres within the city. The segregated waste is then sent for recycling, composting and other kinds of processing, depending on the of waste.

Because of the same, the city was awarded as one of India's best city in 'Innovation and Best Practices' (population 1 - 3 lakh) category in Swachh Survekshan 2018.

The state of Chhattisgarh, which got third rank in Swachh Survekshan 2018, is on the way of following Ambikapur's zero waste model to become India's first zero-landfill state. If Ambikapur can do it, other cities of Chhattisgarh can think of doing it, then why not rest of India?, says Suryakiran Tiwari Agarwal, Municipal Commissioner of Ambikapur.

The success story of Indore, Ambikapur, and especially Kerala's Alappuzha which was even recognised by the United Nations Environment Programme for being exceptional in addressing the garbage crisis, show that managing waste effectively is possible. Decentralised system with segregation at source is a viable option and the way forward, according to experts."

The loan process to borrow money from the international finance corporations and banks is in its last stage and will be completed in the new year.

The MahaMetro is expecting to generate around Rs 6,000 crore from the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development Bank.

""The loan agreement will be signed very soon in Delhi. The money will be used to complete the ongoing works on the corridors,"" Brijesh Dixit, the managing director of MahaMetro corporation, said on Sunday.

Talking about the availability of the funds, Dixit said, ""The funds will be available in phases as per need. The budget provisions will be adequate to meet the current financial needs of the Metro corporation.""

He said about 27% of the work on the Metro rail project has been completed. It has just been two years since the commencement of the PCMC-Swargate corridor works. The ground works for the tunnel too are likely to commence in June.

The officials also talked about the rehabilitation of people affected by the Metro project. They said a way has been paved for the rehabilitation of the Kasba Peth area residents, who had recently organised an agitation against the project.

""The rehabilitation will take place on the premises of the Dadoji Konddev school. The place has already been acquired. A green signal has also been given to raze the current structure and built a new one,"" Dixit said.

He said the residential, as well as commercial properties, will be moved to this campus. Over 200 families will be shifted. ""The Metro corporation will reach out to people and explain its position on the issue,"" he said. According to the officials, two buildings will be built on the campus. While one will have premises for property owners, the other building will be for the tenants."

She has attended two street rallies already, but has almost a dozen more houses to visit and distribute pamphlets before calling it a day. ""This is the need of the hour,"" she says, walking past houses, tea-shops, libraries, among others in her neighbourhood, where, like during the historic floods in August, all discussions have converged into a single topic: a wall.

In this, one might say, Kerala, the seat of the only elected communist government in India, may have unwittingly found something in common with United States, the first country of the liberal capitalism, where President Trump's proposal to build a wall has generated a heated debate.

Geetha is one among the millions of women who are canvassing people to join a symbolic wall Kerala's Left Democratic Front administration is building on 1 January, expected to be one of the biggest demonstrations in the state in the recent past. But, like in the US, the wall has also become a most polarised idea in Kerala.

Titled 'Vanitha Mathil' (Women's Wall), the idea is to have more than one million women join hands along multiple national highways, all the way from Kerala's northern tip called Kasargod district to its southern capital Thiruvananthapuram, as if in an unbroken chain of bricks in a symbolic wall.

While many women agree with the wall's official motive, to feature Kerala's renaissance history and women empowerment credentials, many others, like actor Manju Warrier, have backed out citing its political overtones, especially its relation to the Sabarimala issue.

Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has posited the wall as a signature campaign to prevent the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s biggest expansion yet in Kerala using the Sabarimala issue. Over the last few months, the BJP has been at the forefront of several agitations in Kerala, to prevent women's entry in Sabarimala against the Supreme Court's decision to cancel a ban on women of childbearing age in the temple. In December, the party also created a national cell in an attempt to take the campaign against the Left at a national level.

Some others who would have otherwise joined a pro-left rally have also backed out, like writer Sara Joseph, who do not see the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist), CPM, or the chief minister as a credible agent of renaissance, especially after a party legislator P K Sasi was not asked to resign, even though suspended, after a woman within the ranks raised a sexual assault allegation. Dalit leader Sunny M Kappikad has also backed out citing Vijayan administration's non-committal stand on provide security to women who want to visit Sabarimala bracing right wing protests.

However, the CPM is leaving no stones unturned in its efforts to make the campaign a major success. ""Three women for each meter, that's our calculation. Kerala's road-length is about 490 km, so we shall have 1.64 lakh women. In districts such as (hilly district) Idukki, where the wall is not passing by, we have arranged about 200 buses to ferry women to nearby Ernakulam district,"" said a CPM leader, requesting not to be named.

The CPM also has the backing of other 200 odd organisations whom the administration sees as the legacies of the renaissance movement, including dominant leader of the lower caste Ezhava community, Vellappally Nateshan, who is an ally of the BJP but has a blow-hot-blow-cold relationship with the saffron party.

""What is going on right now is a political battle in view of the coming election,"" said BRP Bhaskar, veteran journalist and a political commentator. ""The reason why the BJP and the RSS have not able to get a foothold here yet is that there is a voter in Kerala which is a product of its renaissance period. At this moment, regardless of its motive, people are forced to take a side in the fight between these two parties, otherwise it means a recession of renaissance and a victory for the pro-temple side. Our choices are always very limited."""

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

AnnualawardsforexcellenceinNationalHighwayssectorhasbeeninstitutedfrom thisyearonwardsforrecognizingconcessionairesandcontractorswhohavebeen performing exceptionally well. Applications have been invited from all the concessionaires and contractors working in the field of highways construction and tolling. These awards are designed across the fivecategories of construction management, operation and maintenance, best toll plaza, safest highway, innovation in design and construction technology.

India's first Highway Capacity Manual developed by CSIR-CRRI was launched this year. The manual is designed to be a tool for guiding road engineers and policy makers in the country. It lays down guidelines for the development and management of different types of roads, based on traffic characteristics on such roads having varying lane configurations.

The Ministry has organized a workshop on 18.12.2018 in Delhi for Regional Officers of Ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL to discuss the issues relating to land acquisition, contract document (EPC/DPR) and E-Disha (ERP projects), new standards and technical specifications. A Manual of Guidelines on Land Acquisition for National Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956 has also been released for seamless process of Land Acquisition for National Highways.

As per the Ministry's annual report on road accidents based on the data reported by Police authorities throughout India, there has been some marginal reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities in 2017, as can be seen from the table below.

The Ministry has been making concerted efforts to address the problem of road safety through a series of measures that include improving road infrastructure, road safety audits, identification and rectification of black spots on roads and strengthening the automobile safety standards, organizing road safety awareness programmes and strengthening enforcement etc. These efforts have started showing some results.

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 651 ON National Highways and 138 are on State roads. Work for rectification of these black spots is at various stages of completion.

The Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufactures and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institute of Driving training and Research (IDTRs), Regional Driving Training Centres (RDTCs) and Driving Training Centre (DTC) have been established which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country and support refresher-training programme for heavy commercial vehicles drivers. The Ministry is implementing a scheme for setting up of Model Institute of Drivers Training and Research (IDTR) by States/UTs. So far 24 (nos.) ITDRs have been sanctioned in different States/UTs and bout 16 are complete and functioning.

The Ministry has issued guidelines associating Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for promoting awareness about road safety under a scheme titled ""Grant of financial assistance for administering Road Safety Advocacy and awards for the outstanding work done in the field of Road Safety"". It is envisaged that the NGOs will undertake activities for creating road safety awareness among citizens.

A mobile App and Toll- free Emergency number 1033 for highway users, developed by NHAI, were launched in March this year. The SukhadYatra mobile application provides information on toll gates. The key feature of the app includes a provision for the user to enter road quality-related information or to report any accident or pothole on the highway. It also provides users with real-time data related to waiting time expected at toll plazas and various facilities like points of interest, highway nest/ nest mini, etc. The app can also be used to purchase FASTags.

The toll-free number 1033 will enable users to report an emergency condition, or highway-related feedback, across the highway. The service has also been integrated with ambulance / tow away services along the roads.

This Ministry observed the 29th National Road Safety Week from 23to 30April 2018. This year's focus was on schools and commercial drivers and the theme was ""Sadak Suraksha JeevanRaksha"". In the opening ceremony the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways emphasized the Ministry's priorities in ensuring safety of road users in the country. Awards were given to 10 school children who won the national level essay competition on road safety. The Hon'ble Minister also administered the road safety pledge to all those present on theoccasion. A variety of programmes related to the Road Safety were also organized in several cities across the country to enlighten people on Road Safety, and Driving Rules. Many NGOs participated in the Ministry's efforts to create awareness about the issue.

The Ministry had constituted a group of State Transport Ministers under the Chairmanship of Shri Yunus Khan, Transport Minister of Rajasthan to work out interstate issues and reach a consensus on adoption of uniform rates of taxation, permits and other issues. A Group of Transport Ministers from 13 states met in Guwahati on 18-19 April this year and adopted a 9-Point Guwahati Declaration aimed at harmonization of taxes and permits, road safety measures, policy changes and measures for strengthening State Road Transport Undertakings. The most important decisions taken by during the meeting included the recommendation for One Nation One Tax for the diverse road tax structure, which would ease travel.

In order to help accident victims in getting reasonable and fast compensation from insurance companies, the Ministry revised the relevant rules of the Motor Vehicles Act according to which every accident victim or his next of kin will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in case of death, and uptoRs 5 lakh, proportionate to the extent of injury in case of grievous hurt and disablement. Accident victims can claim higher compensation through court if they are not satisfied, but with this rule even the poorest of the poor will get a fast and reasonable compensation.

A Central Command and Control Centre is being set up at the NHAI HQ for CCTV surveillance and Monitoring of Vehicular Congestion at 210 Fee Plazas of National Highways that have higher traffic volumes. it is proposed to be connected with Regional Offices and the project execution is on service model for a period of five years.

Three short films for generating public awareness for the need to comply with the rules of the road, eventually contributing to the cause of road safety, were launched by Hon'ble Minister for Road Transport & Highways, on 14th' August, 2018. Film actor Shri Akshay Kumar who featured in these films on pro bono basis, has also been appointed as Road Safety Brand Ambassador by the Hon'ble Minister.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has designated the Asian Institute of Transport Development as an apex body for capacity building in the area of road safety. The objective is that this centre would act as a depository of research studies and best practices.Human resource development and exchange of knowledge form an important component of its activities. Up to October 2018, the National Centre for Road Safety has been able to train over 1,400 professionals in road safety and road safety audit by conducting 31 courses pan India.

The Ministry took several initiatives in the transport sector during the year to make road travel more convenient for people. Some of these areas under-

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

The Ministry has revised the maximum speed of various classes of vehicles vide notification dated 6th April 2018. The notification prescribes the speed of various classes of vehicles.

This will also address Grievances / RTI applications of the citizens and facilitate promotion of Digital India campaign.

With a view to enhancing the safety of women passengers, detailed standards for Installation of Vehicle Location Tracking Device (VLT) and Emergency Button on public service vehicles have been notified on October 25, 2018. The States/ UTs have been mandated to ensure compliance of the rule and check fitment and functional status of the VLT device in the public service vehicles at the time of checking of the vehicles for fitness certification. The Command and Control Centres in the States will be used to provide interface to various stakeholders such as State emergency response centre, the Transport authorities of the state and central governments, device manufacturers and their authorized dealers, testing agencies etc. The Command and control Centre will also be able to provide feed to the VAHAN database or the relevant data base of the state with regard to over speeding and the health status of the device.

As per this notification the renewal of the fitness certificate in respect of transport vehicle up to eight years old shall be done for two years and for one year for vehicle older than eight years.

The Ministry has issued a notification for Dual fuel usage which covers Emission of smoke and vapour from agriculture tractors, power tillers, construction equipment vehicles and combine harvesters driven by dual fuel diesel with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Bio-Compressed Natural Gas (Bio-CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) engines.

Keeping in view the need for promoting electric mobility and alternate fuels, the Ministry, vide notification issued on October 18, 2018, has exempted Battery Operated Vehicles, as well as vehicles driven on Methanol fuel or Ethanol fuel, from the requirement of permit for carrying passengers or goods.

A system has been developed and tested by this Ministry for linking of Pollution Under Control (PUC) data with the VAHAN database. An advisory dated October 1, 2018 has been issued to all the States by the Ministry wherein all the PUC vendors have been directed to comply with the guidelines and facilitate electronic uploading of emissions test data to VAHAN database.

To give a distinct identity to the electric vehicles, it has been decided that the registration mark will be exhibited on a number plate with Green background. A notification to this effect was issued on 7th August, 2018.

The Ministry issued a notification regarding the blending of Gasoline with methanol in order to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions and also to reduce the import burden on account of crudepetroleum fromwhichgasolineis produced.The Hon'ble Prime Minister had announced an ambitious target of reducing 10% import dependence of oil and gas by 2022 from 2014-15 levels. Methanol can be used as an alternative transportation fuel thereby reducing Import dependence to some extent.

The Ministry has requested IRDA and the MDs / Chairpersons of all general insurance companies on to ensure that no third-party insurance policy is issued or renewed without ascertaining the availability of a valid PUC. This has been done following orders of the Supreme Court of India.

The Ministry has notified emission standards for Construction Equipment Vehicles and Tractors. These standards would be implemented w.e.f. 1 October, 2020 (Trem IV) and from 1st April, 2024 [Bharat Stage (CEV/Trem)-V]. This would help in ensuring environment friendly construction / mining activities.

The Ministry notified the insertion of the item 'Quadricycle' as a 'non-transport' vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. A Quadricycle is a vehicle of the size of a 3-wheeler but with 4tyres and fully covered like a car. It has an engine like that of a 3-wheeler. This makes it a cheap and safe mode of transport for last mile connectivity. Quadricycleswere only allowed for transport usage under the Act, but now has been made usable for non-transport also.

6.1 National Award on e-Governance to INAMPRO

The ""INAMPRO"" project initiated by NHIDCL, a CPSE under this Ministry, has been conferred with a 'Gold' award under Category- I ""Excellence in Government Process Re-engineering"" for the National Award in e-Governance by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.

6.2 Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)

The Electronic Toll Collection Program has seen exponential growth in terms of number of Fastags sold and user fees collected electronically. With a total number of 440 Toll Plazas, more than 34.3 lakh Fastags units have been issued till October this year, and 25 to 27% of the revenues are being collected using the ETC mode. Use of FASTag has also seen significant growth, both in terms of user fees collected and penetration, from Rs 210.1 Cr with 13.1% penetration in April 2017 to Rs 44ó. 8 Cr with 24.8% penetration in the month of August 2018.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

A teacher in the garb of an entrepreneur is not someone who comes around too often.

Probably this combination provided the perfect ingredients to build one of the world's most successful edutech start-ups, as Byju Raveendran has shown.

After its most recent round of funding of $540 million from Naspers, General Atlantic and Canadian Pension Fund, valuing the company at $3.6 billion, Byju's has emerged as the most valuable edutech start-up globally.

The company's valuation has quadrupled in the past year, making it among the top five most valuable Internet companies in India.

IMAGE: 'Byju's has expanded it's reach 4x to almost 2,000 towns and cities.' Photograph: Kind courtesy byjuslearningapp/Facebook.com

Starting out as a math teacher pre-2010, Raveendran, an engineering graduate who, after spending a couple of years at a shipping company, realised, like so many others, that his calling was in fact somewhere else.

Taking time off his job, he would help his friends and whoever else wanted to learn crack math and science at entrances such as CAT.

Finding his calling in teaching, he quit his job and started pursuing the career full time.

Soon, he was giving lectures in cities across India.

Raveendran consolidated all his learning and started Byju's in 2011, initially with members of his own learning group.

It's not like other companies did not build education businesses using new-age technology -- EduComp, the firm that installed tablets and interactive screens in schools, had a good run before going bust few years ago -- but Byju's success, standalone in its scale, was on the back of its product.

""Raveendran is very focused on deep conceptual learning and has therefore built a path breaking approach to teaching complex concepts.

""Their product pushes for deep conceptual clarity, helping students perform better and achieve better learning outcomes,"" said Ruchira Shukla, regional lead, Venture Capital, International Finance Corporation, an investor in Byju's since 2016.

""Since we invested, Byju's has expanded its reach 4x to almost 2,000 towns and cities.""

Byju's sells online learning modules for a fee.

The content can be consumed on smartphones, tablets and desktops.

It has built its own repository of content by bringing in thousands of teachers and experts, making the firm a dominant player in the school education market (K12) and the go-to place for entrance examination preparation as well.

As of today, Byju's completes monthly sales to the tune of Rs 1 billion from its approximately 1.3 million paid subscribers.

""After initially creating the material (pre-recorded video lessons) himself, Raveendran continued to work intimately on the content side.

""That got the firm good word-of-mouth publicity in the early days before it installed crazy country-wide sales teams,"" said an education tech entrepreneur who closely tracks the company.

As the company grew, Byju's doubled down on sales, creating a country-wide network of 'feet-on-the-street'.

The quality of school education in India is still not the best and parents, in any place big or small, typically spend on learning outside the school.

Byju, who hails from a coastal town of Azhikode in Kerala, realised that learning is universal and, since the initial days, has led a parallel sales effort in small non-metro town and cities.

Investors swear by Raveendran's insights into the education market, his clarity as far as his business plan is concerned and his vision for the future.

He wants to create a global platform for learning that can be used in all markets.

For now, the company is working on launching in English-speaking markets, mainly the US and the UK.

'We are in the process of building products for the international markets. Our core focus is on getting the K-3 (for grades 1, 2 and 3) product ready for launch in the next 6-8 months.

'For our global product, we looked for acquisitions (abroad) but did not find a perfect fit. Hence, we decided to build the product for the global audience in-house.

'We are working with some of the most popular YouTube teachers who are experts in their own domains,' Raveendran said in an emailed statement.

Byju's scale has also helped the company attract global investors such as the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the philanthropic fund of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan, which led a $50-million investment in the company in September 2016.

Since then, the company has gone on to raise almost $725 million, from a clutch of investors including Chinese Internet giant Tencent.

Even as Byju's looks at opportunities overseas, the company says its key focus will remain in India.

There are over 260 million students enrolled in schools in India, more than even China, making it the largest opportunity of its kind in the world, Raveendran explains.

He has said that unlike his e-commerce peers, who are out to create a market from scratch, the market for education already exists and it's up for grabs."

A fire broke out in a premier state-run Calcutta Medical College and Hospital in West Bengal capital Kolkata early on Monday, in the fourth such incident in three months in a health care facility.

The incident took place around 4am on Monday as smoke was seen from the second floor of MCH building. There were no reports of any injury in the fire, the second in more than three months in the nearly 200-year-old hospital.

The fire, suspected to have been triggered by an electrical short circuit in a refrigerator in the haematology department of the hospital in xxx area, was put out quickly by three fire engines that were rushed to the spot.

""It was a minor fire and firemen doused the flames promptly. There was no need for patients to be evacuated. We are looking into the cause of the fire,"" said director general of fire services Jag Mohan.

Officials said blood tests in the haematology department will not be conducted on Monday.

Before Monday's fire, three hospitals in the city have reported such incidents.

A fire broke out in Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI), that functions under the Union ministry of health, on November 20. The origin of that fire was an air conditioning machine in the genetic research wing.

On November 12, a fire triggered panic at Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine. More than 200 patients were evacuated and medicines worth Rs 5 crore were damaged after a fire broke out in the pharmacy of Calcutta Medical College and Hospital on October 3."
"48","1029706505","2018-12-31","https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/oKVkSjVqbehChCGSMzeLpM/Just-how-many-suits-should-a-man-invest-in.html","Just how many suits should a man invest in?","http://www.livemint.com/",FALSE,"It's a question that's been asked often. How many suits does a man really need? Especially, if he needs to wear one at work almost every other day. The sartorialist will say a man can never have enough well-fitting suits. The no-fuss banker will say as few as possible so that he takes little time to choose while dressing up each morning.

Answers can range from two to 20. But after speaking to designers, stylists, heads of brands and the men who wear these suits every day, we've arrived at the magic number: four. Any additions to this magic number depends on the budget and the style inclination of the individual. A man building his suit wardrobe can cruise through with a minimum of four, ensuring he doesn't repeat one too often and is mixing and matching the jacket and pants with other separates on more casual days.

Men often make the mistake of buying just the jacket. Avoid making this mistake because there will always be a mismatch in colour, material and finish of the trousers vis a viz the jacket. To look sharp instead of sloppy, you should own four suits comprising a matching set of jacket and trousers.

Since suits are an expensive investment, the general rule on adding a new suit to your wardrobe or retiring an old one depends on how often and gently you wear it. On an average, if you wear a suit to work regularly, then consider updating your wardrobe every three years. If your physical appearance has changed (you've lost or gained weight), ensure that you either get the suit altered to fit or replace it. To keep it spiffy and in good condition, get it dry cleaned at least once every four months or sooner if it gets stained.

Below, we break down the suits you should own, the material that works best for Indian weather and the accessories that can add just the right amount of polish. Of course, the fit of a suit plays a definitive role and as far as possible one must get suits tailored or altered according to one's body type.

The Classics

This is the foundation of your suit collection. Start with two classic two-button jackets with matching pants. Choose one in navy and another in either charcoal or black. ""Ideally, a pure wool suit is recommended as they are relatively wrinkle resistant and contour beautifully to your body shape,"" says Aswathi Krishnan, marketing manager at Tailorman, an online menswear label that recently opened its first store in New Delhi.

For Indian weather conditions, a high quality super fine poly-wool suit is the best option. Pair this classic with a spread collar shirt and complete the look with tan brogues when wearing navy and black for the other two. The great thing about owning suits in two of these colours is that you can pair one with the other to create two completely new outfits. Pair the navy jacket with charcoal pants and vice versa and you've got four days of the week sorted.

This is a tricky purchase but is an excellent investment to break the clutter of solids and add some interest to your wardrobe. ""I started with a navy and charcoal suit. But after a few years in finance, I wondered if people thought I had just two suits. That's when I bought one in a traditional pinstripe pattern in a classic single-breasted style,"" says Ankit Saxena who works with a venture capital firm and wears a suit at least five days a week and all week when he's travelling on work. If you'd like to push the envelope further, subtle checks, herringbones or houndstooth are also excellent options.

The Frequent Traveller

Some might argue that your day suit can moonlight as your travelling companion but it's a far better idea to invest in one especially for days that you have to head from flight to boardroom and back. The colour can be classic or a lighter shade of blue or grey. This is a suit that will go through much more wear and tear and will have to come up trumps. ""Business travel suits should have added functionality when it comes to material specifications. For instance, it should definitely be stretch and wrinkle free. Additionally, features like water and oil repellency with breathability will add immense value to your suit,"" says Partha Sinha, assistant vice president, design, Louis Philippe & Luxure, a part of Aditya Birla Fashion and Retail. This suit should also be more lightweight than others so it allows easy movement and leaves you feeling more relaxed. Pair this suit with loafers or monk straps instead of lace-up Oxfords so it's easy to slip in and out, especially at airport security.

With the three pillars above, you can safely step into those conference rooms without fear of looking under-dressed or out of place. As you work your way up the ranks though, supplement and replace -- because no one should be seen in a suit that they last got fitted for when they graduated out of B-school.

The right accessories

Other than a set of shirts that you can mix and match with the suits, your accessories are crucial to making you look sharp.

■ A well-designed high quality brown and black belt acts as a breaking point between the upper and the lower garment and always draws attention.

■ A good quality wallet or cardholder helps to avoid unsightly bulges.

■ A tie can play many roles. It adds sharpness to the look and also gives you an opportunity to showcase your personality. Millennials tend to opt for pocket squares instead of ties which is a good bet."

Here's what to expect in key areas that touch your life. Learning beyond the four walls

Out of class learning is expected to be a key part of the Delhi government's education push in the coming year.

In Delhi government schools, which largely cater to children from economically disadvantaged families, ensuring attendance and establishing a classroom connect with students has been a struggle.

The coming year will see the flagship 'Happiness Curriculum' project completing one year, and implementation of the new 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' for students in classes IX to XII.

Through storytelling, 'mindfulness' classes and interactive activities, 'happiness classes' for students of nursery to Class VIII have tried to help students ""get in touch with their emotions"". The objective of the 'entrepreneurship classes', an official said, will be to develop an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in older children to help them re-orient their goals -- from simply seeking jobs towards innovation.

Shailendra Sharma, principal advisor to the Delhi government, said these curricular interventions are laying the ground for changing the education discourse in classrooms. ""The whole point of happiness classes is to reorient relationships between teachers, students and parents. Students are getting the opportunity to reflect on their thoughts and express themselves without fear of judgement, while teachers can experience their relationship with students beyond just teaching. This is setting the ground for the larger goal of education beyond knowledge transmission.""

On the 'entrepreneurship curriculum', he said, ""Hopefully, this will also help take the discourse to the next level, in terms of what students feel like they're ready for after stepping out of school and what roles they see for themselves in the public arena.""

Education, many believe, is also tied closely to AAP's political fortunes. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has often spoken about education reforms in Delhi during his rallies outside the state; AAP leader Atishi, best known for her work in the field of education, has been made a Lok Sabha candidate; and AAP has frequently harnessed the 'happiness curriculum' for international recognition -- most recently during an education conference in Austria in December.

Even though heads of schools have given positive feedback on happiness classes in review meetings -- such as a greater sense of belonging and an increase in attendance -- some have expressed concern that the flurry of new interventions take away time, effort and focus from the core need to deliver examination results.

This year, several schools delivered zero pass percentages in the internal examinations. The ability to match these interventions with results will be tested in 2019, particularly with children in board examination classes being brought under their ambit.

Move to check overpricing by hospitals

The Delhi government is set to roll out guidelines to regulate private hospitals and nursing homes. Once implemented, the policy is expected to be a landmark decision for Delhi residents who have often complained of overpricing by various private hospitals.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain told The Indian Express that the government will implement the guidelines by early 2019. The advisory was framed after the AAP government formed a nine-member committee, headed by the then Director-General of Health Services Kirti Bhushan, to monitor functioning of private hospitals.

The aim is to ensure rates of surgery packages are ""transparent, without hidden charges"", and hospitals disclose whether they cover any complications during the procedure.

The draft advisory states that private hospitals can charge patients for medicines at the MRP mentioned in the National List of Essential Medicines, 2015, as their prices have already been capped. The policy also prohibits private hospitals and nursing homes from refusing to hand over bodies over pending bills.

""The department is finalising work on the committee report and will release it soon. The guidelines will change the entire scenario of the medical profession,"" said a senior health department official.

In 2019, Delhi will also witness implementation of the Centre's ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme, which has run into some turbulence in the capital over the name of the scheme. At the moment, both sides are in a deadlock.

It has so far been implemented in four government hospitals -- All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Ram Manohar Lohia, Safdarjung Hospital and Lady Hardinge Medical College -- as well as a few private hospitals. The National Health Agency has asked private hospitals in the capital to join the insurance scheme, and 2019 will tell how many follow through.

AAP and Cong: Will they, won't they?

Wild swings in vote shares of the three big political players, AAP, BJP and Congress, which have come to characterise the city's politics since 2014, will largely determine the churning that lies ahead.

For the ruling AAP, doing well in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls is imperative for its ambition to go national. It has received jolts in the recent past owing to successive drubbings in state assembly polls, as seen recently in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

The AAP's political fortunes appear to be tied closely with that of the Congress, with the two parties competing for acceptance among the same sections -- from residents of unauthorised colonies to Purvanchalis -- while the BJP continues to draw support from traders and the upper-middle class.

This is where coalition talks come in: Despite their apparent mutual dislike, there has been no outright rejection from the AAP and the Congress that they are in talks to arrive at an ""understanding"" so that the BJP does not romp home once again by taking advantage of the possible vote cutting.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has so far shied away from giving a straight answer -- whenever asked by reporters, he has maintained: ""We will let you know."" He also insists that the AAP will do ""all that is necessary"" to keep the BJP out of power.

Behind the ambiguous statements are hard facts: In 2015, the AAP won with a 54.3% vote share due to the massive dip in the Congress's vote share, which was down to 9.8%. However, in last year's municipal polls, Congress showed signs of revival as it increased its share to 21.09%, while AAP's came down to 26.23%.

On the other hand, the BJP's vote share has remained more or less constant -- 33.07% in the 2015 Assembly polls and 36.23% in the 2017 MCD polls. Only in 2014 had the BJP notched up an impressive share of 44.81%, on the back of a country-wide Modi wave that swept the party to power.

While back-channel talks may or may not yield results, the AAP has been critical of the Congress in public. At rally after rally, Kejriwal tried to drive home the point that voting for the Congress will end up strengthening the BJP. Addressing one such rally in August, he had said that the Delhi Congress has been reduced to a ""vote cutter for the AAP"".

Leaders in the AAP also point to the fact that Delhi will go to Assembly polls in less than a year after the Lok Sabha elections, and any coalition with the Congress in 2019 may end up harming AAP's prospects in 2020.

""What happens in the Lok Sabha elections will also have a bearing on the Assembly polls. Some leaders in AAP are looking at an alliance because arithmetic says both parties together will be able to keep the BJP out of power. But the implications have to be seen in context of the Assembly polls. Will AAP want to align with the very party whose vote bank shifted to it en masse in 2015?"" said a former party leader.

The Delhi Congress, still smarting from the 2015 drubbing, currently under the leadership of Ajay Maken, disapproves of all coalition talks. It has maintained that the AAP is a ""B-team"" of the BJP and that the Kejriwal-led party is ""desperate to stitch an alliance for its own survival"".

Eight years on, 1,500 buses may roll out

For a city that has been waiting for new buses to join its fleet since 2011, the coming year is going to be a crucial one. At least 500 standard-floor buses, with hydraulic lifts to make them accessible to the differently abled, have already got a go-ahead from courts.

Delhi Transport Minister Kailash Gahlot said 1,000 electric buses will also join the close to 6,000 buses on Delhi roads by June. ""The Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System is preparing a feasibility report, after which tenders will be floated,"" he said.

If all goes according to plan, Delhi will become the first Indian city to have such a large electric bus fleet. This will also be key to Delhi's fight against pollution -- according to recent studies by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and TERI, vehicular pollution contributes to over 35% of particulate matter in the city.

With construction of Metro Phase IV getting the green signal, the other gap that remains is providing last-mile connectivity.

Recently, the Delhi Metro tied up with private app-based cab aggregators to fill this gap. However, in an ever-expanding city, buses and a regulated e-rickshaw service are being seen as the only way to make sure people are incentivised to leave their personal vehicles at home and switch to greener modes of travel.

1.4 lakh cameras on streets, 1 lakh in schools

Education and health will be the focus of the Public Works Department (PWD) in 2019. According to a senior PWD official, ""by the end of 2019, the aim is to construct 12,000 additional classrooms in Delhi government schools"".

The department will also begin work on the hotly debated plan to install CCTV cameras inside schools. ""Over 1 lakh cameras will be put inside 726 schools. The project cost has been estimated at Rs 600 crore so far,"" said Sanjeev Rastogi, PWD PRO.

Cameras are also supposed to be installed in public places, such as markets, across the capital. ""The plan is to install 1.4 lakh cameras across the city; the allocated budget is Rs 350 crore,"" Rastogi said.

Also on the agenda is remodelling seven of the 17 government hospitals, and converting 94 dispensaries into polyclinics.

On the traffic front, PWD aims to clear congestion at Shastri Park and Seelampur by building a flyover. ""It's a two-year project to help manage traffic from Shahdara to Kashmere Gate,"" said Rastogi.

Staring at a financial crisis of Rs 3,000 crore, the North and East civic bodies have not undertaken any big projects for 2019, and will instead focus on completing pending projects.

The North Corporation wants to finish multi-level parking projects at Rani Bagh, Shiva Market, Shastri Park, Idgah and Gandhi Maidan to create parking space for 5,000 vehicles.

The East MCD is focusing on Krishna Nagar, Preet Vihar, Geeta Colony, Babarpur and Anand Nagri; and the South MCD on New Friends Colony, Rajouri Garden, Defence Colony and Hauz Khas.

Blame it on the lethargic attitude of the Motor Vehicle Department (MVD), which sat on the project for two years, after coughing up a whopping Rs 60 lakh for the project: Rs 40 lakh for the driving simulator and Rs 20 lakh for the construction of the building at Kakkanad civil station for installing the machine.

Now, it has been decided to shift the simulator to its Driving Training and Research (IDTR) in Edappal, where the department plans to provide an international standard of driving.

It seems the move to scrap the project came after the department failed to utilise it for the benefit of the public.

""At present, we have three driving simulators. If one simulator could be launched, it would automatically bring a qualitative difference among driving aspirants. Even the department has to deploy a MVD officer for taking care of the machine. We are planning to provide international standard of training to the driving school staff and this will automatically improve the quality of drivers. The three simulators we procured will be used at the IDTR,"" said a top officer with the department.

The driving simulator set up at the Civil Station is aimed at helping the licence-seekers to enjoy a virtual driving experience without having to worry about negotiating the maddening and hostile city roads. As the original body of the vehicle is used here, the learner will get a real-time experience of driving.

Set up in a hall of 800-sq ft area and 15 ft height, it is equipped with a digital screen, air-conditioned atmosphere and a meeting hall. Besides Kochi, the MVD has already set up two simulators in Thiruvananthapuram and Kozhikode. Both, likewise, remain nonfunctional!

""If the department has no action plan to run the project, who allowed them to spend such a huge amount? A massive corruption is involved in this as the project never benefited the public so far.

Transport Commissioner K Padmakumar confirmed the scrapping of the project.

The unusual move is seen as a jolt to the predominance Kunhalikutty enjoys in the party.

According to League sources, party state president Thangal sought clarification from Kunhalikutty in his capacity as president of the IUML national political affairs committee. It is learnt Thangal conveyed to Kunhalikutty that his absence from Parliament was a serious lapse. Sources said Thangal's move was on basis of majority opinion within the party's top leadership.

A certificate of excellence and Rs 75,000 were given to the winners.

It took the team one month to complete the process.

Her parents had gone out for some work while her siblings were at school when the incident happened. The unidentified accused entered the house and stabbed her after strangulating her to death. Police suspect someone close to the family/victim might be involved in the murder.

Additional Superintendent of Police, Shailendra Singh Chouhan said the deceased Sakshi Pathak, a resident of Bhicholi Mardana area was stabbed and strangled to death at her residence. She along with her family resided on the top floor of a four-storied building.

Her father Narmada Prasad and mother left for some chores around 9.30 am and her four siblings were at school. The victim's father returned home around 1.15 pm when he found Sakshi murdered. He was shocked and raised an alarm when neighbours reached there after which police were informed. A piece of cloth was found tied to her neck and three to four stab injuries were also found on her body.

It is believed that the killer who knew about the family members' whereabouts, took advantage of th situation and entered the house after her parents left home and stabbed her after strangulating her to death. However, the exact situation would be known only after autopsy report. Sakshi had cleared her Class XI exams and had given up education after that.

Preliminary investigation revealed that a uncle reached home and he took a mobile phone SIM from Sakshi around 11.45 am. By then, everything was normal. Police said that the killer entered house between 12 pm to 1.15 pm. The CCTVs installed around the spot are also being examined by the police to trace the accused. Some suspects were detained by the police and the investigation is underway. A police official claimed that we will solve the case soon.

The two-day meet was inaugurated in a private school on Saturday.

More than 500 educators from all over the country joined the meet with the agenda of building 'Happy and Safe Schools'. In his address, Balasubramanian gave an example of a cobbler explaining that anyone can be an educator. ""We have limited the idea of an educator to a strict instructor. People give examples of Finland for education, but their education policy leads to happiness because it works on it as its prime vision and mission,"" he remarked.

Balasubramanian said happiness element cannot be built in class ninth, it must start from nursery. ""We work on curriculum, which is like a horse race, which refers to doing better than one is capable of,"" he said and added that such a system promotes jealousy and competition, which is against the idea of happy schools. ""A good school is where children laugh. But today teachers are busy yelling, making children unhappy because they are unhappy,"" he said.

Balasubramanian laid stress on yoga, appreciation for goodness, being truthful and giving unconditional love for becoming happy humans and better teachers.

The rumbling controversies and divisive trends of 2018 erupted in a perfect storm of chaos at the year's end with parts of the US government paralysed by a showdown between President Donald Trump and the Democrats, while senior officials quit, foreign and strategic policies fell into disarray, and the stock markets tumbled.

Chief of Staff John Kelly and his Defence Secretary, Jim Mattis havr quit, and so has Nikki Haley, his United Nations ambassador and the first Indian American to serve on the US cabinet, along with several other officials.

Adding to his sense of isolation, Trump lost control of the House of Representatives, the lower house, to the Democrats in the November mid-term elections (even though his Republican Party strengthened its hold on the Senate).

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" Trump tweeted on Christmas Eve, a picture of isolation.

He lacked the votes that are required beyond a simple majority to pass budget legislation in the Senate to include funding his $5.6 billion demand for building a wall along the Mexican border to prevent illegal immigration, which was one of his election pledges.

He stood firm on not accepting a budget without the funding for the wall and the Democrats were equally defiant about not providing for it, leading to the government running out of funds and causing the shutdown.

Illegal immigration was one of the flashpoints this year as Trump moved to curb the inflow of migrants - many of them economic migrants or those upset by gang-violence and seeking to claim refugee status.

To discourage parents and others who bring children with them to claim sympathy and lenient treatment, he ordered the separation of children from parents citing a President Barack Obama-era court order against keeping children in custody for more than 20 days.

It became a public relations nightmare for Trump and under a new court order, he had to reunite them.

Meanwhile, more than 10,000 Central Americans came in a convoy in November to the Mexican border hoping to enter the US by the sheer force of their numbers.

Trump mobilised the military to back up the border patrol to stop them. After some unsuccessfully tried to attack border patrol personnel and rush through the border, they are now camped out in Mexico awaiting their turn to appeal for asylum and posing a problem for both countries.

This opens the way for Israel's and the Saudi's nemeses Turkey, Iran and Syria (and, by extension, Russia) to increase their influence in different areas of the region - upending the core of US policy that relies on Riyadh and Jerusalem.

The withdrawals from Afghanistan will likely have an impact on South Asia and affect India.

The troops pullback led to the resignation of Mattis, who opposed the pullout from Syria, and to criticism from many Republicans and conservatives.

A positive development in 2018 - though still clouded by uncertainties - is Trump's North Korean diplomacy that led to a summit between him and Kim Jong-un, the Pyongyang strongman, after Trump's characteristic blasts of insults and threats.

They agreed in principle to denulearisation of the Korean Peninsula and North Korea has begun dismantling its missile production and test facilities while there has been no progress on nuclear disarmament.

On the economic front, Trump, who had promised to tackle the trade deficits and bring back manufacturing jobs, took on Mexico and Canada and reworked the trade agreements to reflect what he considered a fair deal for the US.

While India and other countries were in his sights as tried to lower trade deficits, he launched an almost full-fledged trade war of tariffs against China, which retaliated. It has added to the uncertainty from the budget battle and the US central bank policies and wiped out all the gains the stock markets made this year. Wall Street indices ended in the red for 2018, even though by most measures, especially the low unemployment, the economy was strong.

With their control of the House, Democrats, who are smarting from the 2016 election defeat that they blame on Russian interference, will be pushing harder for investigations into Moscow's role and into whether Trump collaborated with the Russians, as well as into various allegations against him and his family.

So far the 18-month investigation by a special counsel has only trapped people connected with Trump campaign, including his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, on charges like lying to investigators and bank fraud.

A significant reflection of the nation's political divide is gun control, which the Democrats overwhelmingly support and Republicans oppose, and that will be a key issue as the nation gears up for the 2020 elections.

This year saw at least four incidents of mass shootings, including one at a Florida school that killed 17 and at a Jewish temple that took 11 lives in Pennsylvania.

Trump is crossing the half-way mark of his four-year term and will be in full campaign mode in 2019 as all parties start preparing for another polarising election in 2020.

Short of an impeachment or evidence of direct collusion with Russians or a major criminal case, Trump will be his party's candidate.

For the Democrats, the test will be to come up with a charismatic and unifying leader and a coherent policy alternative, which they did not manage in 2018.

He said scholarships have been provided to more than 3.11 crore students belonging to minority communities, including about 60 per cent girl students, in the last three-four years.

""This year, a 'National Scholarship Portal Mobile App' (NSP Mobile App) was launched which will ensure a smooth, accessible and hassle-free scholarship system for students from the poor and weaker sections"", the minorities affairs minister said. He said amount of scholarships is now deposited directly into bank accounts of students though the DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) mode in a transparent manner that has eliminated middlemen.

Naqvi further said Modi government's efforts for educational empowerment of all weaker sections, including minorities, have yielded results at the ground level. He said the school dropout rate among Muslim girls fell to 35-40 per cent from previous high of over 70 per cent, due to awareness and launching of the educational empowerment programmes.

""Our government is working with a mission to bring it (the school dropout rate) down to zero per cent in the coming years. Education is an effective step towards empowerment. The government is successfully moving forward towards educational and social empowerment of all weaker and backward sections of the society, which will stop their political exploitation,"" Naqvi said."

A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

Vasudev Patkar, sculptor and plasterer; Tehmi Ghadialy, porcelain and glass restorer; Mohammed Damani (in pic), an antique clock repairer; and Swati Chandgadkar, a stained glass restorer, help the architects and conservationists conserve the city's past.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

Samir Bharadwaj conducts paper workshops across Mumbai where he teaches how to neatly slice paper, and fold it just right, so that you can create your own automatons and pop-up books. Even if you don't become skilled at it, hand-eye coordination in adulthood is good for you.

Kahaani Designworks has culled 26 letters of the English alphabet of the original Art Deco typeface by looking at the buildings. Ruchita Madhok, principal designer, says, ""They are all geometric, not cursive, resembling the style of the building.""

The NCPA opened its 'secret garden' for open-air concerts in October. The garden is designed to provide an outdoor experience whether it be a jazz night with wine and cheese or a chamber orchestra. More such concerts will be held in 2019.

Suyash Rawat, a 32-year-old emergency medical practitioner, has set up Mumbai's first surf school, along with Krishna Lamani, who previously worked as an instructor at the Kovalam Surf Club. Rajori beach enjoys a kilometre-long stretch of grey sand and is a perfect place if you are still at an introductory stage. Call a day prior for weather conditions.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla.

A senior school administration official said the footage of the CCTV cameras was checked. (HT FIle)

A 13-year-old boy, a student of class 6 of a private school in east Delhi, suffered multiple injuries after he fell down from the third floor of the school building Friday morning. He is battling for life in a city hospital.

The incident took place around 8.30am, soon after the morning assembly prayers. The boy is currently in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital and is unfit for recording a statement. No case was registered in connection with the incident, the police said.

The boy's family blamed the authorities of the school for the incident. They alleged that no safety measures were in place at the school premises to avoid such an incident. The family also suspected foul play and demanded a probe to ascertain the circumstances under which the student fell off the building.

The school authorities, on the other hand, ruled out foul play and said they were extending their cooperation in the police enquiry. A senior school administration official said the footage of the CCTV cameras was checked.

""The footage shows the boy having an argument with some fellow students after which he ran to the third floor and jumped. A staffer was present on the third floor but by the time she could stop him, the student had jumped. We rushed the student to the hospital,"" the school official said.

Police said they have initiated an enquiry to ascertain whether the boy attempted suicide or accidentally fell off the building. The footage of the CCTV cameras is also being analysed. The statement of some students was also recorded, they added.

""The boy is still under medical observation. Once he is declared fit, we will record his statement to ascertain the exact sequence of events which led to his fall from the building,"" Ved Prakash Surya, additional deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara), said.

The boy lives with his family in northeast Delhi. His family members said they dropped him off at the school around 7am as he had to appear in an internal science exam.

""I got a call from the school and they told me that my son was injured and admitted to a hospital. I rushed to the hospital and learnt that my son had fallen from the school building. He has suffered multiple fractures and head injuries,"" a family member of the boy said."

And the episodes within these shows are like mini-featurettes themselves, many of them serving as perfect storytelling devices or just brilliant standalone features. Take for example, Chapter One: Make Your Mark and Chapter Seven: Loud, Fast, and Keep Going of the HBO show Barry or the brilliantly trippy Teddy Perkins (from Atlanta, which won Emmys for single camera cinematography and sound editing, and was nominated for outstanding writing) -- so much has been said and/or written about the writing, direction, and cinematography of these episodes that even if you don't watch these shows, you've probably heard of or seen Donald Glover as the character Teddy Perkins, in all his ""white face"" surrealism.

My list doesn't include episodes from either Barry or Atlanta. Neither does it include any from certain well-received shows like GLOW or Pose, neither of which I unfortunately watched. Which is why, this is an entirely subjective list of the best episodes of 2018 -- picked from the shows that I watched and most enjoyed. You may not agree with them all, but here goes!

Maniac was a strange, delightful show -- it had all the oddball weirdness of Fargo (the movie or TV series, or any other Coen brothers movie, for that matter) along with the slightly off-centre, difficult-to-place hippy trippy vibe of Legion. But then it also had two bonafide movie stars in Emma Stone and Jonah Hill, which I'm tempted to believe, made the show runners want to experiment even more with the show's cinematography, visuals, and narration.

While Maniac had quite a few enjoyable moments and episodes (both Exactly Like You and The Lake of the Clouds had interesting and quirky dream sequences, and Option C was a verifiably smooth finale), my favourite episode of the entire series was episode 4: Furs by Sebastian. In what is Annie and Owen's first shared fantasy, Stone and Hill play Lin and Bruce -- a working class Long Island married couple trying to track down Wendy the lemur, as a whole lot of crazy goes down around them. It's difficult to pinpoint what's the best thing about this episode (the hair, the outfits, the accents, the way everything ties back together in the end), so I'll just say it was the lemur.

You'll be forgiven for not loving The Alienist. For those not immersed in behavioural/criminal psychology and true crime, the show may have seemed a bit meandering and muddled. Set in a time long before criminal profiling was a thing, The Alienist sputters, albeit eloquently, its way through what was then a very inefficient investigative process, before episode 5 -- Hildebrandt's Starling -- amps up the suspense and mystery in the investigation. Daniel Bruhl's psychologist/alienist character Dr Laszlo Kreizler learns that the man they suspected to be the killer, isn't actually the killer after all, leading the investigation (and investigators) to turn inward and revisit their assumptions. It's the turning point that makes a mystery even more delicious!

If you aren't watching the 2017 DuckTales reboot, you're probably doing a few things wrong in life. The David Tennant starrer (he voices Scrooge) is such a ridiculously good reboot that you might just forget that DuckTales is associated with your childhood Sundays, watching the cartoons in your pajamas. No, I'm kidding, DuckTales will always be about our childhoods, but this version brings a slightly (just very slightly) darker twist to the overall story arc, making it a bit more appropriate for 30-somethings to binge-watch, without making it seem like we're malfunctioning adults clinging to the rose-tinted nostalgia for the '90s.

In what was a stellar first season (followed by an equally promising quarter of the second season), episode 11, Beware the B.U.D.D.Y. System!, does something very few shows/movies can do effortlessly -- it packs an interesting episodic story into a superhero origin tale, making it pretty much the perfect episode. A sweet storyline about Launchpad finally getting his driver's license and wanting to show it to Scrooge meets the action-packed antagonism in the form of tech CEO Mark Beaks and his self driving car meets bumbling intern Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera's debut as the cybernetic suit-wearing robotic superhero 'Gizmoduck' (voiced by little known genius Lin-Manuel Miranda!) -- if I can just bottle the essence and charm of this episode, and spray it on every day, maybe I'll be eternally happy?

All six episodes of the first season of Derry Girls had the typically irreverent humour and madness of a British sitcom, but episode three stands out as the perfect mix of teenage silliness, familial nonsense, and the frailty of religion even for those who are apparently deeply committed to it. In this episode, our ragtag group of friends in late-90s Ireland see a dog that looks a lot like one of the girls' pet, who's supposed to be dead and buried in her back garden, according to her mother. The group follows this dog into a church and what ensues is a hilariously concocted tale of smirking and weeping statues, possibly resurrected dogs, a hot young local priest who everyone is attracted to, and a desperate attempt by the teenagers to sit out their exams. Add to the mix the awesomely anarchistic Sister Michael (who looks like an eye-roll emoji in human form) and you have an episode that has you LOLing throughout.

Westworld's second season was, erm, interesting. As the show started expanding on months-old fan theories, many viewers were disappointed that the show felt less like a vivid narrative storytelling attempt and more like confused exposition. Episodes like Riddle of the Sphinx (with flashbacks about the attempts to create human consciousness in a host body to achieve immortality) and Akane no Mai (set in the Shogun-themed park) were great, but a lasting image of Akecheta of the Ghost Nation narrating the story of his life is what really stood out through the season. Episode 8 -- Kiksuya, meaning ""Remember"" -- was a terrific episode about Akecheta's love that never was, and his attempt to find The Door.

Brilliantly acted by Zahn McClarnon as Akecheta (he'd also played Hanzee Dent on the second season of Fargo), Kiksuya was so much more than just the customary philosophical detour on Westworld -- it was a heart-wrenching episode about love, longing, and the truth, and it elevated the show unlike any other episode before it had.

Sharp Objects was, quite possibly, 2018's most unpleasant and uncomfortable series to watch. And I'm not even referring to the creepy ending (spoiler alert ahead, for those who, for some reason, haven't watched the series yet, or read the book) where we find out the teenage Amma was the cold-blooded killer, who'd built a dollhouse floor with the teeth of her victims, to mimic her mother's ivory floors (cringe!). Unlike most viewers, I didn't think Amma was very angelic or sweet, so the idea of her as the killer wasn't as shocking to me. But the slow reveal of the damage done to her by living in that god-forsaken house with her mother Adora -- that was creepy and unsettling. And Falling, the penultimate episode of the series -- does a great job of really digging into the claustrophobia and heaviness of a life lived under the exacting eye of a mother suffering from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and who's trying to slowly kill you with rat poison!

Falling is also where Amy Adams' character Camille Preaker fully realises the depth and true nature of her mother's glossed-over-by-everyone-in-the-town homicidal tendencies. Eeks!

Big Mouth is a deliriously bold show about puberty and sexuality in all its icky crazy glory, and the teen angst that accompanies it. The second season of the show was solid, as it built on the storylines of season one and also expanded the narrative around some of the interesting recurring characters. Having dealt with issues of consent and drug-use, the show's big bold move this season was the standout episode 5 -- The Planned Parenthood Show.

Part sketch comedy, part instructional comedy, part effective after-school special, The Planned Parenthood Show was a clever look into all the services that Planned Parenthood provides, besides the commonly-assumed abortions. It begins with Coach Steve's (who's recently lost his virginity) sex-ed class, and the discussion among the students ranges from a Star Trek-like space adventure sketch in the year 2126, to help women in need of pap smears to a Bachelor-like show where one of the student's older sister Leah must choose the type of contraception that's right for her. In 2018, with all the debate surrounding women's bodies and their rights, this episode was a brilliant way to inform. And it starred Nathan Fillion, so there's that too!

A classic example of a self-contained episode that also furthers the story, Chapter VIII was essentially a two-person feature that involved Gabe ""interviewing"" Sam for his documentary Am I Racist? (a documentary which he has to do for his 'Documentary in the Age of Youtube' class, which is the most 2018 thing ever!). It cleverly dissects both white privilege and the white saviour complex, as well as Gabe and Sam's relationship, which is on the rocks by now, and not in the way a glass of well-preserved Scotch should be.

In a deftly written and constructed episode, Sam accuses Gabe of exploiting and friends and her, and also calls BS on her message being more palatable when coming from someone who looks like Gabe (i.e. a white man). ""You're Elvis, and I'm Chuck Berry. One deserved to be the biggest star in the world, and the other one got to be"", she tells him. Ouch!

12. The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story

Episode 4: House by the Lake

As a series based on real life events, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story feels like a docudrama with brilliant casting, excellent acting, and a gripping, gritty narrative. The series has a lot at stake -- from staying true to the way the events surrounding Versace's death unfolded to tackling issues such as homophobia and HIV, among others.

On the heels of the sombre episode 3 -- A Random Killing (which portrayed serial killer Andrew Cunanan, played with uncanny perfection in a career-defining role by Darren Criss, torturing and killing Lee Miglin, a big-shot Chicago real estate developer who'd invited gay escort Cunanan over to his house in his wife's absence) -- comes the episode House by the Lake. This genuinely terrifying and sad episode delves into Cunanan's first murder -- his cold blooded, premeditated murder of his acquaintance Jeff Trail, a former US Navy lieutenant, in the loft apartment of his former lover David Madson. House by the Lake focuses on Trail's murder, Cunanan's decision to flee to Mexico with a forcibly complicit Madson, and his subsequent murder of Madson when he confronts Cunanan about his many spiralling lies. Because the series switches back and forth, we later learn in a subsequent episode that Cunanan might have really loved Madson in some way, which makes his killing of Madson unbearably sad. Also gut-wrenching is the fact that both Trail and Madson (played beautifully by the ridiculously good looking Finn Wittrock and the young-Andrew-McCarthy-lookalike Cody Fern, respectively) were nice, young men -- who were dealing with their own insecurities at that time, about their professional abilities and their identities as young gay men. It's one of those sad, beautiful episodes -- made worse in its sadness and beauty because it's all true.

Sam Esmail revels in his auteurship, especially in this episode of Homecoming. Optics, the third episode in the series, comes at the perfect time for the viewing audience -- young military vet Walter's been at the Homecoming facility, attending his sessions with caseworker Heidi Bergman, acting all nice and trusting for way too long. There has to be something more sinister going on at the facility...we feel it, how is it that he doesn't? And right on time, his fellow vet and friend Shrier convinces him to steal a van and break out of the facility to explore what's around -- how do they even know they're in Florida? Because of the palm trees? They drive around (in circles?) and when they reach an eerily deserted part of downtown, they're spooked. We're spooked too. For some reason though, Walter and his friend buy the explanation that it's a retirement community. We the discerning audience, don't. But then again, our memories aren't being altered/erased, and isn't that what's happening with everyone at the facility? Including Julia Roberts' character Heidi the caseworker.

Optics did a great job of showing us just how clueless we often are in life -- Walter's faith in the facility and the government, his trust in Heidi, her own confused willingness to move forward with her life -- and how important our instincts usually are. Even Thomas Carrasco, the DoD bureaucrat who's investigating the facility, is clueless about the broader jigsaw surrounding the Homecoming Transitional Support Centre, and that makes it even more exciting when he persists in his investigation and is rewarded with a big fat sitting duck of a clue!

As a huge fan of Amy Sherman-Palladino's writing and of the deliciously witty first season of The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, I must say I was quite disappointed with season two. What started out as the Weissman-Maisel clan's fun and stylish sojourn to Paris and continued through the middle of the season in the form of an extremely quirky summer trip to the Catskills, soon turned a bit sour and ended with a whimper as Sherman-Palladino returned to one of her favourite tropes -- where the female lead returns to her ex, because, women. Eyeroll. It's a trope that was used very often on the Gilmore Girls -- it wasn't believable when Lorelai showed up at Christopher's house when things went south between her and Luke at the end of season 6, it wasn't believable or flattering when Rory slept with a married Dean as if she had first dibs on him at the end of season 4, it certainly wasn't flattering (or even necessary) when Rory kept up her affair with an engaged Logan in the Gilmore Girls Netflix revival, and ugh it wasn't remotely believable, flattering or necessary when Midge went to her weasel of a husband Joel seeking comfort in what was meant to be a cliffhanger of the second season, while she's almost engaged to a tall Jewish chunk-of-hunk doctor who loves her, and who looks like Zachary Levi btw.

Anyway, rant over. Despite the evident flaws in the narrative, Sherman-Palladino certainly knows how to write a compellingly witty episode, and episode 5 -- Midnight at the Concord -- is a great example of that. There's a lot going on -- the families have all gathered at a resort in the Catskills, bringing a whole lot of Jewish weirdness to the fore. Susie is pretending to work at the resort (she just shows up there and walks around with a plunger in her hands, so everyone naturally assumes she's part of the plumbing crew!). Midge rushes to NY to work a shift at the department store, and she begins dating Benjamin; she even tells him about her stand-up gig, which he's totally impressed and on board with. Things seem to be going well for her until she goes back to the Catskills to perform at a club...where her father shows up in the audience! Abe Weissman is a quirk of the highest order (I mean, he's played by Tony Shalhoub) but he's also a proud man, and seeing his flustered daughter on stage spouting really dirty (and apparently funny, but not to him) things in front of strangers, bewilders him. Some of that pride is also hurt because he realises there's a huge part of his kids' lives that he knows nothing about. This episode finally brings this long-withheld confrontation before us, and does so in classic Sherman-Palladino style -- with wit and grace.

Castle Rock was a thrilling watch for fans of Stephen King, but for those unacquainted with the master of horror and suspense and his world building, this 10-episode anthology series served as a perfect introduction to the dark grey morally questionable world that King creates.

Episode 7 -- The Queen -- worked as a standalone episode that also furthered the narrative arc of the season. Ruth (Sissy Spacek in a pitch perfect role as a mother suffering from Alzheimer's) navigates through shifting timelines to try and stop the killer (The Kid) who has entered her home. As a viewer, you can sense her confusion about what's really happening in the present, but it's fascinating to watch her survival instincts (the use of the chess pieces to re-orient herself, sending her grandson Wendell away to protect him etc.) work so sharply despite her dementia, only to result in a heartbreaking accident in the end. The Queen was a beautifully shot, acted, and written episode...and it set the stage for the breakthrough episode of the series in Henry Deaver.

The Good Place is a show that keeps pleasantly surprising us in the ways it presents some of life's most complicated philosophical and moral dilemmas, and after the brilliant Trolley Problem episode of season 2, I'm never quite sure what wonderful thing Michael Schur will come up with next.

The answer is episode 10 of the third season -- Janet(s). After sucking herself, Michael, and the earthlings into a void, resulting in all the humans taking on Janet's appearance, we have multiple Janets, each with the personality of the human it has taken on the appearance of. And boy, does actress D'Arcy Carden (who has played Janet with such flair, it's uncanny really) step up to the task at hand! There's also a visit to Accounting (where we learn that nobody has been admitted to the Good Place in 521 years!), an existential crisis barely avoided, and a tender moment in the ongoing love story of Eleanor and Chidi. This episode was as irreverent as you'd expect The Good Place to be, but it's all the more striking with how utterly creative and hopeful it is.

If there was a list of the most cinnamon-roll-y sweet, sunshine-y bright, and genuinely nice episodes of 2018, all 16 episodes of Queer Eye and the special would be on that list. The show is so completely entertaining and feel-good that we sometimes forget how useful and informative some of the conversations are. Tan, Jonathan, Antoni, Karamo, and Bobby are the dream cast, and their interactions with their subjects and their extended families/friend circles have been thoroughly insightful. Remember Karamo's conversation with former Marine and NASCAR fan Cory, about police brutality, good cops, and civilians (especially black folks)? Or Bobby's interactions with anyone religious?

Episode 5 of the second season -- Sky's the Limit -- about Skylar, a trans man recovering from his top surgery, was reflective of how truly open to learning and understanding the core cast members are. Tan asked genuine, honest questions to Skylar, about what it's like to be trans, and it provided great commentary on how truly different every queer experience is, and how we shouldn't make the foolish mistake of clubbing them all together.

A lot has been said about Killing Eve: how it's unlike any show we've seen before, with characters unlike any that have been written before etc. The many nominations for Sandra Oh (who plays Eve Polastri, an MI5 officer obsessed with an assassin) and the accolades for both her and Jodie Comer (who plays said psychopathic assassin Villanelle) have certainly been justified. The first two episodes present to us the quirky and stylish world of Killing Eve -- where people are killed, sure, but they're all probably deserving of it anyway. Besides, Villanelle kills her victims with a bespoke bottle of poisoned perfume or a beautiful bejewelled hair accessory; the setting is some or the other beautiful part of (mostly) Europe; and the oddball tendencies of both the officer and the assassin are almost, well, charming.

Just as we're beginning to get comfortable with this set-up, Don't I Know You cuts through our complacency like a sushi chef cutting through a plump piece of fish. Our (slightly nervous) laughs stop by the end of the episode, as Villanelle repeatedly stabs Eve's partner and mentor Bill (David Haig) in a crowded nightclub, thereby immediately raising the stakes in this game, and letting us know that behind the quirky, stylish facade is the mind of a psychopathic killer.

""Isn't your leader the free sex guru?"" ""Free sex? We don't charge for it, if you mean that."" Such moments of levity are somewhat rare coming from Ma Anand Sheela -- the complex, can't-quite-place-her, is-she-a-victim-or-the-perpetrator second in command to Bhagwan ""Osho"" Rajneesh in Netflix's award-winning documentary series Wild Wild Country.

A provocative, no-nonsense spokeswoman and leader, Sheela's rise to the top and her eventual fall is well-documented in the six-part series, but it's Part 3 when we begin to realise the true extent of her power, and it's scary AF! Going fearlessly against the local people in Antelope, Oregon, Ma Sheela enlists thousands of homeless people to build their ranks in an upcoming local election. The politics within and outside the cult are fascinating to watch, and it's even more intriguing to watch this seemingly harmless woman come up with some rather diabolical plans to maintain her position -- within the cult and beside her beloved Rajneesh.

The fourth season of Star Wars Rebels was a terrific one -- facing off against the most menacing antagonist in the Star Wars universe, Grand Admiral Thrawn with his Imperial war machine, the Rebels (Ezra, Kanan, Hera, Sabine, Zeb, and Chopper) travel from Mandalore to Lothal, where it all began. The Sith is trying to exterminate the Jedi forever, and in their biggest casualty of the war against the Empire, in episode 10 Jedi Night, Kanan perishes while saving the lives of Hera and his friends.

Episode 13 -- A World Between Worlds -- in some way, brings closure to a lot of things. Caught in a void between time and space, Ezra (who hasn't quite mourned Kanan's death) is led to another portal which brings him to Ahsoka's season two finale battle against Darth Vader; this time, he manages to pull her into the void and saves her. He wants to do the same to Kanan, but in a heartbreaking moment, he realizes he can't/ought not to because otherwise, he and the others would perish. Kanan losing his eyesight in that season two finale was shocking for a kid-friendly animated series, but his subsequent death, Ezra and Hera's mourning of it, the way this episode brings back Ahsoka, and the arc forward from here on, makes A World Between Worlds one of the absolute best episodes of television not just of 2018, but possibly all time!

We finally see the Ring, and what a stunning sight it is! Holden and Naomi reconcile, Amos and Prax keep their bromance going, Bobbie and Alex bond -- all this while deadly protomolecule hybrids are gearing towards Mars and survival is the only thing on everyone's minds! Well, that, and some making out!

In a great season overall, Immolation was the episode that triggered a turning point for a lot of core loyalties and friendships. I'm so glad Amazon scooped up The Expanse for another season because it would've been a shame to miss out on more of this kickass group doing more kickass things in outer space.

I'm so so glad that START is how The Americans ended -- too many incredible shows have said goodbye with utter disappointments (looking at you, Dexter!). In what was arguably the best series finale ever, START capped off six seasons of slow-burn brilliance into an episode that had it all -- anxiety and nervousness about the spy game, Cold War era politics, the fast-beating heart of a family thrust into motion in anticipated-yet-unexpected ways, the cold gut-wrenching and ultimately futile reward of the FBI neighbour and friend confronting the illegals, the heart-stopping escape...and, well, unflattering 1980s wigs.

A lot happens in START -- from Elizabeth and Philip Jennings (as always, a top-notch Keri Russell and Matthew Rhys) preparing to leave for the USSR with their daughter Paige, but leaving their son Henry (who doesn't know the truth about them being spies) behind, to Stan's worst fears about his friends coming true, to the ultimate rush of escape (in disguise, of course!)...only for the older Jennings to realise that Paige had gotten off the train in order to stay behind. For a show that wasn't about cliffhangers at the end of each episode, the twists in START are very edge-of-the-seat and thrilling. The episode was also a masterclass in restrained storytelling, direction, and acting, which is something that can also be said about The Americans on the whole. Bring on the awards please!

It's almost as if someone said to BoJack Horseman series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg that it would be impossible to improve upon the brilliance of the season 3 episode Fish out of Water, to which he said ""hold my drink"", went to his office and came back with the genre-defying genius of season 5's Free Churro.

BoJack's mother is dead, and abusive or not, he's still tasked with rendering a eulogy for his dead parent. In a 20-minute continuous scene, BoJack (and the audience) grapples with the dark reality of life with an abusive parent and how shockingly inconsequential it feels in the face of death. ""She was really good at dispensing life lessons that always seemed to come back around to everything being my fault"" -- through his words, we experience his pain, anger, disbelief, despair, and the realisation that what he thought of as a loving moment between him and his mom was actually just like their relationship -- empty and meaningless. Except for the free churro he gets because the girl at the counter at Jack in the Box felt sad for him when he told her he was feeling shitty because of his mother's death. So yes, ""No one ever tells you when your mom dies, you get a free churro."" Of course, in true BoJack fashion, it turns out that he's at the wrong funeral the entire time, speaking at a lizard's funeral instead of Beatrice's. Curtain!"

In a teaser to her online masterclass on creative writing, author Margaret Atwood reminds us plainly: ""People are always coming up with new theories of the novel. But the main rule is: Hold my attention."" All other matters of literary discourse become secondary when you realise that all a book needs to do is to hook and to hold, till the last page does you part.

I thought of this constantly when I read Bridge of Clay by novelist Markus Zusak of the bestseller The Book Thief fame. His new book is an ambitious, affecting family saga, but one that took frustratingly long to pull this reader into its folds.

This is a little heartbreaking because Bridge of Clay, with a fable-like quality, is all heart, infused with a variety of wonderfully moving themes about loyalty, family, love and grief and about building bridges - to take us to people we love, to move from the past and to the present, and to pave a way forward. The book was nearly two decades in the making, Zusak has said and that he struggled with it, especially with chronology and consistency and finding the right voice for the narrator.

Some of this struggle shows. Bridge of Clay has a plot weighed down by tragedy upon tragedy, but is dressed in poetic prose, which stays afloat with the help of an army of affectionately written characters.

It is essentially a coming of age tale about five Dunbar boys who live in a chaotic house without grownups, with rules of their own and a gang of animals for company (some of them are very important to the plot) because their father, Michael, abandoned them after being consumed by grief following the slow and painful death of their mother, Penelope.

""Early on, our father was called to the schools, and he was the perfect postwar charlatan: well-dressed, clean-shaven. In control. We're coping, he'd said, and principals nodded, teachers were fooled; they could never quite see the abyss in him. It was hidden beneath his clothes.

He wasn't like so many men, who set themselves free with drink, or outbursts and abuse. No, for him it was easier to withdraw, he was there but never there. He sat in the empty garage, with a glass he never drank from. We called him in for dinner, and even Houdini would have been impressed. It was a slow and steady vanishing act.

He left us like that, in increments.""

Bridge of Clay kicks off when Michael, referred to as the ""Murderer"" for a reason we learn later, walks back in and asks his sons for help to build a bridge. The story presumably plays out somewhere in Australia. Why he left them to fend for themselves and why he wants to build a bridge now are questions that are dutifully answered, memory by memory, by the end of the nearly 600-page book that brims with symbolism and metaphors and existential questions that do not all have answers.

To get there, we must first dip into the story of the dark-haired, determinedly complex Clay, the fourth Dunbar boy of exceptional emotional strength, he who guards a brave secret deep within him as he volunteers to build the bridge. This is his story, about his devastating loyalty to his mother, Penny, and about the girl he fell in love with, Carey.

""The girl was good and green lit:

The clear-eyed Carey Novac,

The boy was the boy with the fire in his eyes.

They loved each other almost like brothers.""

The other captivating character is Matthew, the oldest Dunbar boy, the narrator of the novel. It is his perspective that ties it all together as we criss cross through the messy, violent lives of the young boys and the people around them. If Clay is the emotional core of the story, Matthew is the backbone, the most responsible among the unruly lot of boys, the one who fathers his brothers, studiously trying to keep them out of trouble at school while working jobs to pay the bills after they are left to fend for themselves.

The book's chief flaw - its slow, loose and disorienting flow in the first half - meant that even a good hundred pages in, I felt impossibly lost in its many strands that begin and end and jump places and timelines before you can register what happened moments ago. You don't feel rooted to a physical space that grounds the story and would likely question its premise but the book teases you time and again to allude to a big reveal that could explain the motivations of both Clay and his father.

Bridge of Clay spans several decades with many scattered but compelling subplots. This gives the novel a certain scale and heft but the pacing and stylised prose often feels painfully uneven. But once the fog over the narrative clears up a bit, it's easy to be charmed by the fact that there is, no doubt, a fair bit to admire in this novel.

Zusak's universal story of love, death, redemption, broken relationships and what it takes to mend them has a quiet beauty that shines through particularly in the moving backstories. The episodes that pull us closer to the boys' mother, the piano loving Penelope, and her and Michael's love story (""..he was almost the perfect other half of Penelope; they were identical and opposite, like designed or destined symmetry"", and later, her losing battle with illness, are deeply stirring and wonderfully written.

""Penny was playing the piano.

She played through the sunrise, she played through our fights. She played through breakfast, and then long past it, and none of us knew the music. Maybe it was a misspent rationale; that when she was playing she wasn't dying - for we knew it would soon be back again, having swung wire to wire.

There was no point closing the curtains, or locking any of the doors.

It was in there, out there, waiting.

It lived on our front porch.""

Zusak's prose, reminiscent of The Book Thief, jumps between staccato, choppy, provocative sentences and longer, sparklingly sensitive and vivid portions, a distinctive style which while inspired feels jarring on many occasions here. It is in the latter half, when his voice is coherent and assured, with a comforting layer of cracking humour, that you begin to feel invested in the journey of its characters to the bridge that could make them whole again, to pull off what they believe will be a ""miracle, and nothing less"".

I nearly gave up reading the book several times. But I persevered. It would be fair to say that by the end of it I felt somewhat rewarded. The aftertaste certainly feels more satisfying than the hours spent poring over it."

Prologue

Srinagar 29 March 2022

Shabir Ahmad Kaloo, the editor of The Kashmir Front, stroked his trim Kashmiri beard as he punched furiously on his laptop. Then with a flourish, he finished his piece: ""The PM of India, Are You Listening?""

As he slouched back in his swivelling office chair, Shabir gave his editorial a final once over.

Looks all right ... enough to give the Indian agencies another sleepless night, he smirked as he scratched his sharp aquiline nose.

A whiff of air from the open window suddenly blew away some paper from Shabir's desk, which was, in any case, cluttered with all kinds of reports, newspaper clippings, and files. Instinctively, Shabir bent down to pick those up from the floor. And winced in pain.

""Bloody hell!"" he whimpered, as his fingers also picked up some dirt from the unswept floor.

Looks like the sweeper has not been coming for quite some time, thanks to the frequent hartals in the city.

Surrounded as it was by all kinds of buildings, Shabir's office in downtown Srinagar had no natural light. And the musty smell was now all-pervading. That's why the windows had to be kept open.

Just then, he heard a knock on his door.

""Come in,"" he said.

A tall lanky clean-shaven Kashmiri man entered his room.

Shabir looked up. ""Ah Khurshid! There you are.""

Khurshid entered the room with a laptop bag. He took a seat facing the editor.

""Did you manage to get what I'd asked for?""

""Yes, Sir,"" Khurshid said hesitantly. He opened his laptop and showed the pictures to Shabir.

""I think this one would be appropriate.""

Shabir adjusted his round spectacles that gave him, as he was told, a decidedly intellectual look, and stared intently at the picture of a dead young girl. Her head covered in a scarf, scars all over her face and her eyes closed. Her face-so peaceful.

""Perfect. Is it from the paar folder?"" Shabir asked referring to the stock images sent by the Pakistani agencies from across the border.

""Yes Sir. So, if we use this image, we will get paid extra. But Sir... just to clarify, this girl is not Kashmiri. She's probably a Syrian who was killed in an US air strike conducted against the ISIS.""

""Doesn't matter,"" Shabir replied, ""The girl looks Kashmiri, and the image fits the editorial I've just finished ... So just email the picture to production and you can leave.""

Shabir proof read his editorial once again giving it some final touches. The production then uploaded the article along with the photo of the girl as a front-page editorial.

The editorial's last few paras read:

For how long, will you keep on killing us? For how long? Just yesterday, your Indian Army gang raped and mercilessly killed a 16-year-old innocent Kashmiri girl. Her only fault-she was good looking. And, of course, that-she was a Kashmiri.

Mr. Indian PM, do you know why young men are pelting stones at your army? Want to know the real reason? The reason is, that we're sick and tired of your farce democrazy, your manipulated elections, your governments imposed from Delhi, a democracy that has no place in the world we are trying to build in Kashmir.

You've exploited us since 1947. You have bartered our water and exploited mercilessly our power and mineral resources. And when we raise our voice, you kill our boys and rape our women. Someday, Insha'Allah, you'll have to pay for this all.

It's no longer the fringe, Mr. Indian PM. Every boy and girl on the street is throwing stones at you, and at all your instruments of coercion, loot, and plunder. It's a revolution. A mass movement. How many will you kill, Mr. Indian PM?

You have no option but to leave and give us our cherished azaadi.

As Shabir swivelled back in satisfaction, he experienced another sharp pain on the left side of his abdomen. He winced as he massaged that side of his belly. The pain now radiated to his back. His breathing became laboured.

The pain had been bothering him for quite some time. And so Shabir had consulted his school friend, Dr. Anil Koul, a nephrologist with Apollo Hospitals, who advised him to rush immediately to Delhi for some advanced tests for his kidneys. Shabir could have scheduled an appointment in Srinagar in SKIMS (Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences), but he had no faith in the local doctors. Most were so busy minting money that they had little time to keep up with the latest developments in their respective medical disciplines.

Funny Anil Koul, Shabir mused, thinking about his friend who was the declared joker of their class because he was always joking! His family too had ""migrated"" out of the Valley in those turbulent 1990s because of the threats from those Islamist zealots, as they claimed. But Shabir's belief was that it was that evil Governor Jagmohan who had asked the Kashmiri Pandits to ""run away"" so that he could have a freer hand crushing the Muslims. Shabir and Anil could never agree on what was the real cause but had remained friends regardless.

His mobile buzzed. It was Air India.

""Mr. Kaloo, Shabir Ahmad Kaloo?""

As Shabir confirmed, the chirpy female voice on the other end continued, ""Sir, we apologise, but your flight for April 1, 2022 on Air India AI 0825 for the Srinagar-Delhi sector has been cancelled for technical reasons.""

Bloody hell! Bloody Air India?!

""Okay, but would you be then making any substitute arrangements?"" Shabir asked sharply.

There was silence for a few seconds.

""I'm sorry Sir,"" announced the female voice on the other end, ""but all our flights are running full. Your payment is being refunded and will be credited within 24 hours to the credit card you used for the booking.""

There was a sudden rude click at the other end disconnecting the call.

That was no help. But what the hell? What else did you expect from this perpetually bankrupt national carrier?

So Shabir logged on to his favourite MakeMyTrip site and looked for flights for 1 April. Usually, there were some twenty non-stop flights from Srinagar to Delhi every day. So, he was confident he would be able to find another flight. But funnily, all flights looked fully booked.

Desperate, he tried yatra.com, goibibo.com, cleartrip.com, and then the websites of Jet, Indigo, Go Air, Vistara, SpiceJet, Air Asia-every airline site he could recall. No seats still. He tried via Jammu, via Chandigarh, even via Leh, and then looked for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th April, but the result was infuriatingly the same.

This was crazy. The tourist season was a month away, and still the flights were all packed.

Unbelievable!

One option was to go to the Srinagar Airport that day and try finding a seat on any airline that was flying out. But in the security-crazy airport area that wasn't so easy. You had to have a valid ticket before you could enter the area. But how can you have a valid ticket if the airlines were not offering any?

The only way to short-circuit the security, Shabir knew, was to declare you were going to receive someone. But for that too, you needed an official vehicle. Or an authorised travel agent who could give you a lift.

Anyway. These were the only two options Shabir could think of, and so, after a few calls, the influential editor of the Kashmir Front managed to locate the driver of an IAS officer who was going to the airport on that day to pick up his boss.

*****

Came the D-day, and surprisingly Shabir could make it to the arrival area of the Srinagar Airport with no hiccups. The glass building with its sharply sloping roofs was designed to look like snow covered Himalayas. But to Shabir, the airport looked more like a bunker. A reminder of India's colonisation of Kashmir.

He thanked the driver profusely and rang up his contact in the security who escorted him to the airline ticket counters OUTSIDE the terminal building.

""This is the maximum I can do Shabir Saheb,"" the police man told him. ""You have to have a ticket now for entering the departure area.""

Fortunately, there were no queues at the counters. But that was a no brainer.

There were no queues because there were still no vacant seats on any airline.

Meanwhile, flights circled overhead and kept on landing. Passengers kept on arriving in droves on all kinds of vehicles and kept on getting inside the building.

It was almost after half-an-hour of waiting that Shabir could observe an interesting phenomenon. The passengers flying out all appeared to be non-Kashmiris. Most were in uniform, from the army or BSF, CRPF, or any of the other tens of para-military outfits posted in the Valley.

But strangely, all the flights that were landing in were only disgorging Kashmiris-men, women, children, all looking quite flustered. There were no Indian or foreign tourists at all.

After observing for an hour, Shabir couldn't control himself and approached an arriving family-seemed like husband, wife, son, and daughter.

""Bhai Saheb, is everything all right,"" he asked.

The man and his wife and children exchanged glances.

""How the hell do we know?"" the man exploded.

Shabir slunk back, shocked, and speechless.

Fifteen minutes later, he approached a departing man in uniform, ""Sirji, are you flying out today?""

""Obviously I am. But why are you asking? Aren't you a Kashmiri?""

""Yes, why?""

""Then you should be happy you've got what you've been asking for,"" he said. And then looking at Shabir's quizzical face added, ""your blasted Azaadi, what else? So, enjoy your freedom now. And don't bother to come to India. Ever.""

Then a group of women decided to take a chance.

In 2017, an unlikely group of entrepreneurs -- refugee women armed with an idea, some cooking skills and a lot of hope -- built and opened Timangolo's first and only restaurant. Within two months, the women were turning a profit. How they found the confidence, basic business skills and capital needed to bring their dream to reality highlights the success of an International Medical Corps program known as Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS), and how it can empower even society's most vulnerable people.

The idea of women's safe spaces in unstable environments is not new and has grown widely over the past decade, especially in areas where strongly patriarchal cultures exist and the disruption of armed conflict or natural disaster can make women and girls even more vulnerable. Even so, opportunities can be found here: though women and girls are disproportionally exposed to traditional cultural barriers and safety risks, they are often the agents of positive change in their communities. Spaces created by programs such as WGSS function as safe havens that in crisis fulfill a critical need -- where survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) can discreetly muster the confidence to report such incidents without fear of reprisal and receive immediate support.

In more routine times, the safe spaces are locations where women and girls can gather in a protective environment, receive information, build support networks to improve their safety and well-being, and gain skills that can empower them.

In the case of the Timangolo restaurant, a safe space provided a place where the aspiring women investors first received encouragement to proceed with their project, then got the tools needed to launch it: advice from an International Medical Corps partner with expertise on running a business, plus a start-up grant of less than $100.

International Medical Corps is an acknowledged leader globally in the development of WGSS programs and has helped establish them in some 20 countries affected by humanitarian emergencies, including Cameroon. The programs have become an important part of our work to prevent GBV and to support survivors of such violence when it does occur.

In Cameroon, groups of vulnerable women and girls include refugees from Nigeria's far north and western areas, as well as from CAR's East Region and local host communities. In neighboring Nigeria, groups include residents of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in and around the cities of Maiduguri and Damboa in the troubled northeastern areas, where the infamous Boko Haram militant group first began its attacks more than a decade ago and continues to be a malign presence, strengthened by an alliance with the Islamic State.

International Medical Corps' technical coordinator for GBV programs in Cameroon, Jacqueline Uwimana, explains that there are three key components to our strategy for preventing violence against vulnerable women and girls:

Raising awareness within communities on women's civil and human rights, and underscoring that culturally accepted traditions of inflicting violence upon women and girls are illegal, morally wrong and must be reported to authorities;

Adding capacity to raise awareness and provide essential assistance to survivors of GBV, including individual case management and the option for referral to complementary services; and

Empowering women to raise their voices, by creating women-led organizations within communities, and strengthening support networks for women and girls to provide them with skills that can generate income, such as embroidery, sewing, catering, trading, textiles and farming.

""The culture prevents women from speaking up at meetings or discussing issues in public like rape and other violence toward women,"" says Hassana Pindar, who manages International Medical Corps' WGSS program in Nigeria. ""We urge them to speak out because it's their right to do so.""

Yet Pindar admits it has not been an easy task. ""When we started, the cultural barriers were too high,"" she recalls. ""Women had to ask their husband's permission just to leave the house and come to the women's shelter. Once here, they would nervously check the time to make sure they wouldn't be late home. Very, very, very slowly they gained confidence, so that now it's no longer an issue.""

The key to this change of behavior? A simple three-letter word: men. Long treated mainly as the central cause of GBV, men were instinctively viewed as the barrier to progress -- the adversary of women seeking empowerment to do more with their lives. Though men certainly play this role, they are not destined to forever do so. They also have the power to transform community resistance toward women's empowerment into wholehearted support, because in highly conservative, traditional societies, community leaders and elders -- invariably men -- are the custodians of these traditions.

""How could we change this without being helped by the keepers of traditions?"" Uwimana asks rhetorically. ""Impossible.""

Pindar agrees. ""To gain acceptance of these new ideas in the community, we have to engage the men,"" she says.

Faced with this reality, program managers like Pindar and Uwimana began reaching out to community leaders and others in positions of influence to convince them that oppression and violence against women and girls weaken the community as a whole. They also began to push back against community efforts to stifle the reporting of GBV-related incidents while promoting efforts to empower women by teaching them income-generating skills.

Uwimana says her team actively searched for potential partners among men in the in the community: those who sent their children to school, for example, or were known to help their wives, and who could understand the benefits of preventing GBV and of empowering their spouse by providing them with the option to learn skills that could add both to household income and to the community's economy. They offered these men sensitivity training -- within what Uwimana calls ""Husband's Schools"" -- where they could learn how to communicate women's empowerment as a social benefit for both individual families and the community.

""We've learned we have to engage men in this, especially for violence prevention,"" she says. ""Once they get it, that's when we begin to see progress.""

Progress has come in many forms -- such as the organized pushback against plans by a local Muslim imam in the Cameroon town of Mblie to marry an 11-year-old girl. After eventually giving in to the pressure from other men involved in Husband's School, he renounced the planned marriage and joined a village committee campaigning against gender-based violence. Today, when child marriages do occur, they usually are conducted in the community's shadows.

In the Nigerian town of Auno, a 48-year-old husband and father named Mallam Dauda says that an International Medical Corps sensitivity session for men about the social and economic consequences of GBV changed his life. ""I now often talk with other men about its dangers,"" he explains proudly.

The lesson here is that when residents of both sexes work together to protect women and girls, and encourage active community engagement, the outcomes can be impressive.

""We've seen some wonderful results,"" notes Pindar. ""I've seen women who were hardly surviving who are now able to provide for their families and plan for their futures. The programs have changed, the design has changed. That's why we've achieved success.""

Though Women and Girls' Safe Spaces have existed for many years, there were few guidelines available for which strategies worked and which didn't. To rectify this, in 2014 International Medical Corps began a two-year research project -- with support from the US State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM) -- to study the effectiveness of the safe spaces created for refugees who had fled war in South Sudan for camps in Gambella, Ethiopia. Findings from this study reinforced our commitment to the safe spaces as an important approach for supporting women and girls.

In 2017, International Medical Corps partnered with the International Rescue Committee to develop guidance that could be used globally to implement safe spaces for women and girls: The Women's Safe Space Toolkit (WSSTK), which is being developed through coordination with multiple agencies and piloted in four countries, with BPRM support. Work on the project began in early 2018 and is expected to take two years to complete.

Meanwhile, back in the village of Timangolo, the initial success of the refugee women restauranteurs led them to reinvest their initial profits in upgrading restaurant's building. The upgrades generated profits of 300,000 Cameroon francs (about $520) over a period of five months -- and started the women thinking about other possible ventures to empower themselves and the community."

The event was organized in association with the Government of Telangana's India Joy that happens to be India's biggest gaming and entertainment expo. The second edition of Unite India had a key focus on Industry 4.0, trends in automation with advancements in data exchange and a lot more. The automotive sector also witnessed a healthy interest and was a key area of discussion. A lot of sessions were hosted around the automotive space and Express Drives was invited to be a part of this event.

In order to understand the company's plans in a better way and how its technologies and innovations will help in multiple areas in the automotive sector, we got a chance to interact with three key spokespersons from Unity Technologies - Hubert Larenaudie, President APAC & Global Head Distribution Platform, Andrew Bowell, Vice President Product and Tim McDonough, General Manager, Automotive.

Q1 - How the concept of virtual showrooms will help the customers in car buying and how Unity Technologies is contributing to it?

Ans - One of the things that we want to do is to build a more direct customer relationship so a virtual showroom, instead of a customer searching for a car online and then go to a dealer, is a great way to do that. The virtual showrooms that you see today are just for much better user experience and the question that may come to the mind is that why you need to look at a car that is not much bigger than a particular size while making such an expensive purchase. The reason being, a true virtual showroom will let you, in real time, take a walk around the car, zoom in zoom out, see the interiors, put on a VR headset or build a VR experience so that you can take a look at the car in front of your house or inside a parking place. So, it's a better user experience, its direct customer relationship with the OEM for something which the people are looking at.

Customers can also give feedback for manufacturing and if OEMs have a better configurator, it is also a good way to mint money and hence, can drive revenues. There are also new OEMs that are building electric cars and these don't want to necessarily build a dealer network. In that case, they can sell much more digitally compared to first buy a real estate. So we think its changing in multiple ways.

Q2 - Unity Technologies has tied up with multiple OEMs. So exactly with what OEMs, the company is working at the moment and does it have plans to add more manufacturers in near future?

Ans - So we are working with eight of the top ten. In this regard, we have made top progress since we made this business to make an exponential growth a year ago. And not all of them are public, you see the Volkswagen Group, Audi and BMW that are a part of the Volkswagen Group and there is Volvo, so there are eight of the top ten pretty much. And the same thing goes for the aerospace companies. They are using us as well.

Q3 - Coming to the vehicle servicing, how much time saving and beneficial you think real-time 3D and AR VR are to train the staff at the workshops? Because looking at the current infrastructure, the resources are very limited for this.

Ans - We think it is beneficial in two ways. One is the cost. The cost of building an application at Unity is relatively inexpensive and this is one of the prime benefits. We see OEMs doing two kinds of training. The first kind of training is training manufacturing workers and Volkswagen just recently put out their press release about it and we think they were very impressed with the results. They are getting new manufacturing line up in running. They are training 10,000 workers in 120 locations. So how do you do that? So they build a simulation of the factory in VR and they were able to train all those workers simultaneously with a very tight time window on all its locations and they were getting better training results.

In order to keep the training competitive, they said if you want to win, you have to make the best possible score, not just pass but you have to win. Such kind of scenarios lead to higher productivity and faster work on a factory line and that is worth the time and money. An inefficient factory, a factory not running at full capacity is painfully expensive.

The second kind of training we see happening along is the service. In the old school set up, the employee needs to look at the door, then go to the PDF, then look at the PDF and to and forth ten times. With AR assisted training, I will be looking through a Google glass like a Hololens or a magic Leap One, we put all of them and you see an overlay of instructions so the employee does not need to go back and forth and you can undo your tasks easily. Hence, you are saving time and you do not have to cognitively jump back and forth. So this is basically about being faster and delivering higher quality because you are really not making mistakes. So we think the benefits are very very strong.

Q4 - Speaking of driving schools in India, many of them are employing driving simulators nowadays. So is Unity Technologies working in that direction as well to train people in a much better way?

Ans - Interestingly, a Maruti Suzuki showroom in Gurgaon went ahead and told that they want a driving safety simulator. Basically, a driving simulator comes at a much later stage of the evolution. The first stage what we have seen is creating a full haptic base. A VR fire simulator as an example, one of the solutions based on Unity is Decon Labs in Melbourne and there is a professor who built a full HTC Vive firefighting simulator that gave an idea of how much of factory you can save. Coming back to the topic, the Maruti Suzuki guys reached out to Vive guys and the Vive guys eventually got us involved and asked if we could open doors with the University guys to show and they created a VR safety center and that was the output of that conversation.

So if you are saying a driving simulator, we don't have a used case in the Indian context. But in terms of firefighting, first, it came to the University and now it's our product. The equation is the training value and one of the matrices is realism where it is proving that the more realistic the simulator, the more training values are raised and the outcome is better training in terms of a driving school, a fireman and more. If you have seen our videos, you must have noticed that realism is the key to us technically.

AR-VR for the driving simulators will mostly be done in the west first before it is coming to India. There is a medical device company just to mention, at IIT Madras and through it, they have demonstrated the haptic feedback based precision surgery. They had a session called Merkel labs on the industrial track.

Q5 - Here at the Unite India 2018, we are talking about the internet of things, connected technologies, the latest trends in technologies, Industry 4.0, is Unity Technologies also contributing to the logistics and supply chains in India to ensure that there is not any delay in the delivery of a product in any way, directly or indirectly?

Ans - Not in India but we have some case studies witnessing in Singapore but it is quite not in the public domain. This is abroad technology platform and we have to do machine learning with Unity that is used in, for example, simulation, visualization training for automated vehicles. So generally it is a platform to solve the problems in that space. We probably can't mention that the customers were engaged with that or not publicly. In terms of Industry 4.0 what you just mentioned, we think Unity Technologies is currently in a very good position and where we want to be. On a broad level, the plan is being discussed in Malaysia and Singapore as those places are the hubs for logistics.

Q6 - Any plans to implement this in India as well in the coming years?

Ans - We think it depends on what customers are choosing to do. As a development platform, we will try to make it possible if customers can adopt it. Like there are production lines or power plants and for example, digital twins of a gas turbine and if someone wants the digital twin running in Unity to see what exactly is happening in that physical thing in the power plant. We do have customers doing that. So it is not a specific supply chain example but it is more of a power creation example.

Q7 - Now coming to vehicle design, how real-time 3D, AR-VR are changing the way how cars are being designed. What are the exact benefits?

Ans - 8 of the top 10 OEMs are using us and design is the first place where they all started. If you are an automotive designer, you are designing something as big as this table that's 3D and in case of a 19 or 21-inch monitor, that's 2D. It's very hard so they started using our technology because if you want to visualize your design in real size and human scale, you will have to prepare a model that will take months and a lot of money or you can use this technology called Powerwalls. Most OEMs have 1,2 or 3 so you have to sign up the Powerwall like reserving a really good restaurant so you need to wait a month, get on the Powerwall and if your boss suggests for a particular change which will take another month to do it.

After that, the designers might say that the boss forgot what he told them to do and now he wants to undo it and bring it back. So the repetitive cycles in designs were super slow. What we now have is CAT program with the help of which one can translate the data, bring it to Unity and put on a headset. With this, we do it and in like 30 minutes, we come back and make a decision. And it is much more collaborative. So the biggest benefit is better product design and we can see OEMs building designs faster with lesser mechanical models. Volkswagen gave us these statistics publicly that we can share. They saved up to 5 million Euros per model design by making their designs faster and reducing the number of mechanical models. So basically, it is better quality and lower cost.

Q8 - Would you like to talk about any future developments from Unity Technologies in terms of the automotive sector?

Ans - It is really interesting how much is being done. We have already talked about design and we have touched upon training as well. Another one would be sales and marketing which is really powerful.

We think the way cars are bought and sold is going to change. With more people buying online, they will finally get to the decision before they head to the showrooms. There are two more. One is autonomous driving so we have a number of customers today who are rather than trying to drive their cars are doing it at Unity with the simulative city.

So that business is going really fast. In addition to being cheaper and faster, the solution is also safer. If you can train a car what to do if a child is taking a ball across the street in the simulator, you can't really do it in real life. There are scenarios that are built with really good algorithms after training and simulation. We think we are helping make cars safer. In addition, many OEMs are trying to find out what all people are going to do in that car when they don't have to drive so you are seeing a lot of prototypes and a lot of screens in those cars and that will open a revenue stream. They are offering entertainment services, commerce services via those screens in the car that will be beneficial for all of them. So that's all being prototyped and developed at Unity.

Q9 - Any completely new area where the company would be venturing into when it comes to the automobile sector?

Ans - The last two are pretty new. Also, we think simulation is really just taking off because there is an ecosystem of roads and objects and Unity to generate scenarios and we can see that happening on a massive scale. For us, it is a big move. Simulation is going to happen on the cloud may be its a private cloud or hybrid private cloud and probably not in public cloud so there are going to be millions of scenarios running at Unity every single day. A lot of OEMs have been relying on us for R&D due to our efficiency and we have been focussing on the performance of the engines, beautiful graphics and it will really help us to create something really interesting and futuristic.

Q10 - Are there any challenges you see in the Indian market?

Ans - Well, India is moving really quickly but that only gives us more opportunities and challenges. The market is changing and even in one year, there has been a significant increase in the usage of AR-VR. The OEMs have been relying on us for better solution, graphics and at the same time, we also are growing with the market and it is a very positive surprise. Take an example of Tata and Mahindra, they are global and are currently among the top companies in the world. I don't exactly see any challenge except for the fact that the country is very big and this, in fact, is an opportunity. The number of submissions this year at Unite India compared to last year are quite high and the quality is also higher this time. With the coming of 5G, it is only going to be bigger and better and we a part of this big movement. And India is a very interesting market and is very big in terms of industries and servicing that is going faster as well."

Gone are the days when Indian students opted for either engineering or medical courses after high school. Today's generation is not shying away from taking the road less travelled. Unlike before, they now have a pool of options to choose from depending on their personal interests and skill sets. This trend has also caught on with individuals studying overseas.

The 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange revealed that Indian and other international students in the U.S. are turning to off-beat courses. While traditional STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) courses continue to be their top preferences, some specialised courses such as robotics, automation, and mechatronics are also witnessing an increasing demand.

Here's a look at some courses that are set to gain popularity in the forthcoming year.

Robotics

Thanks to the rapid progress of AI (artificial intelligence), robots are no longer considered dumb-machines that are only capable of doing simple, repetitive tasks. With the arrival of humanoids like Sophia and SoftBank's Pepper, robots have made huge leaps in recent years. Simultaneously, the career options for students who specialise in robotics has expanded. From doing research to designing industrial robots, they have the opportunity to work in a variety of industries. Therefore, the number of students opting for courses related to robotics is likely to go up in 2019.

Automation

With the Fourth Industry Revolution upon us, automation has already started making profound impacts on the business world. Be it manufacturing, automotive, or retail, nearly every sector is now investing heavily on automating tasks that are tedious, repetitive, and dangerous. As traditional job roles are evolving, the demand for automation experts is growing by the day. This explains why a large number of international students are now leaning towards automation courses. Other than automation engineering, certification courses in industrial automation are also expected to take off next year.

Mechatronics

Mechatronics is a fairly new branch of engineering that has recently caught the attention of students. As described on Stanford University's online portal, it is at the intersection of mechanical engineering, electronic engineering, and software engineering. Broadly speaking, mechatronic engineering focuses on technologies involved in building intelligent electro-mechanical systems. After completion of their course, graduates can look for work opportunities in various areas including automation and robotics, AI and expert systems, sensing and control systems, computer integrated manufacturing systems, and transportation and vehicular systems. Since it is a specialised field, only a few universities currently offer this course in undergraduate and postgraduate levels.

Disability programmes

According to a World Bank report, one billion people across the world have some form of disability. At a time when people with disabilities make up 15% of the global population, the demand for disability support workers is on a rapid rise in many countries. In Australia, for example, the Healthcare and Social Assistance sector is speculated to grow by 16.1% by 2025, creating as many as 2,50,500 new jobs. Students with a degree in disability programmes can find a wide range of jobs. Be it a speech therapist or a full-time caregiver, the options are plenty. Students can also decide to work for government bodies after graduation. Most medical schools in popular study destinations offer specialised courses in disability care.

Infection control

Another course that is tipped to gain popularity in 2019 is infection control. This specialised field of study prepares students to work in an array of settings such as hospitals, healthcare facilities, government departments, and private labs among others. While only a handful of universities offer regular courses in infection control, students can opt for certificate courses or part-time programmes. In most countries, however, they need to get a license before they start their professional career.

Besides these courses, students are also getting lured by other interdisciplinary programmes like geophysics, marine engineering, and game design and development, says the 2018 Open Doors Report on International Educational Exchange.

When it comes to Indians, the scenario is not much different. Although the majority of them still prefer to choose a safe career path, popularity for unconventional courses are slowly growing. And in the new year, it is expected that this shift in their demeanour will become more prominent."

Indeed, the ruling party, in its marathon run since 2014, has drawn much of its fuel from the accumulated anger the larger Sangh Parivar has against Nehru and his political progeny. A manifest symbol of the hatred the reigning right in India harbours for Nehru, the Congress argues -- with ample support from a school of intellectuals and historians -- is the ""destruction"" of institutions that India's first prime minister built. The other manifest symbol, is the revival of icons posited as ""victims"" of the Nehru ""raj"". Ambedkar, who the BJP now accuses the Congress of conspiring against but who was no darling of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) when he was alive, is being appropriated by way of a sprawling 12-acre memorial in Mumbai, including a 351ft statue. Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, who, ironically, as India's first home minister, had banned the RSS in 1948 following Mahatma Gandhi's assassination, is getting his day in the sun in Gujarat. ""The Patel statue is a concerted attempt to obliterate Nehru and Gandhi both from our national memory,"" says Suhas Palshikar, a Pune-based political scientist and the chief editor of the journal Studies In Indian Politics.

This grand narrative, an ideological and political construct to obliterate an earlier one, explains itself in the birth and death of statues this year. The irony in this clash of narratives is a shared fascination with monumental grandeur -- Nehru had it and Modi has taken it, literally, to newer heights. In Nehruvian times , 50ft was considered too tall a luxury for a socialist government to fund. But the logic of the Modi age propels monuments into orbits of machismo meant to dwarf everything else that has come before.

Ram Sutar, 93, has personally traversed this epochal distance between Nehru and Modi, having designed at the request of both these prime ministers. And like the two very distinct eras, the statues that Sutar has sculpted too differ vastly in their scale and statement of intent. In the 1960s, Sutar's marquee assignments were measured in feet. His tallest work was 45ft high -- the Chambal devi monument was a tribute in bronze to the Chambal river and the brotherhood between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Forty-eight years later, Modi got Padma Bhushan recipient Sutar to design a monument astounding in its size. The 182m-tall Statue of Unity consecrates Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. ""Nehru ji had an artistic appreciation for sculptures. The statues he commissioned were more of a tribute whereas the monuments Modi ji has got built are tributes as well as sources of inspiration. To each his own,"" says Sutar, who refuses to comment on the choice of statues but underlines their significance for a people. ""Well, statues do inspire. And they are a way to say thank you,"" he says.

Between the two prime ministers, quintessential symbols of the times that produced and shaped them, Sutar's sculptures have metamorphosed. From modest odes to the spirit of collectivism, enterprise and humanity, to humongous ballads in bronze, they signify the distance between the monuments and the masses they are meant to mesmerize. In 1963, when Nehru wanted Sutar to sculpt a 50ft statue that would commemorate the human capital involved in the making of the Bhakra Nangal dam -- ""the temples of modern India"", according to Nehru -- an estimated budget of ₹15 lakh was thought to be prohibitively high and the project was shelved. ""It was a high amount those days,"" recalls Sutar. But in 2018, the statue saga went epic in scale. The Patel statue -- world's tallest -- cost nearly ₹3,000 crore.

Once height became the measure of greatness, a statue-erecting frenzy ensued among the BJP-ruled states. The proposed Shiv Smarak (Shivaji Memorial) is a statue standing 121.2m tall on a pedestal measuring 87.4m in the Arabian Sea. Larsen & Toubro won the bid in March for the construction estimated to cost ₹3,650 crore. A tall order in itself but it is still a good 60m shorter than the Gujarat giant.

The Shiv Sena, ever more uncomfortable with Modi, perceived a slight in Patel's statue -- construction of which started in October 2014 -- being taller than the one being built of Shivaji. Not content with the apotheosis of national icons, the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh has decided to reach for the divine itself. On the banks of the Sarayu river in Ayodhya, a 151m-tall statue of Ram will be built. In Maharashtra, the proposed Ram statue has put pressure on the state government to see if the Shivaji Memorial can go even higher. In this fight for height, Ram Sutar is the only common factor. It is his designs that Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh have accepted. ""These are all grand plans and we are excited to be working on them,"" says Sutar's son Anil, who assists his father.

""There is an unprecedented gargantuanism which is on show now. You can't see these monuments, their faces. This gargantuanism has become the symptom of the new idea of history,"" says Shiv Visvanathan, professor at Jindal Global Law School, and director, centre for the study of knowledge systems, O.P. Jindal Global University. He distinguishes these ""authoritative spectacles"" from what he terms as the ""humane memorials"" of Mahatma Gandhi or Ambedkar found in abundance in public spaces. ""There is something endearingly human about those memorials. They aren't statues, they are memorials. A Mahatma Gandhi memorial in a public park is a place for sparrows to sit,"" Visvanathan says, adding, ""This obsession with statistics and statues drives what I call the Guinness Book mentality,"" he says.

Palshikar, however, says statue politics is not exclusive to the right wing in India and offers a more nuanced explanation for the BJP-RSS' newfound fascination for big monuments. ""Memorializing of icons is the hobby of ruling classes generally. In India, the right wing was marginal in its societal impact and hence the statues belonging to their iconography were limited or non-existent. They are probably compensating for that backlog now with a vengeance,"" says the political scientist.

But rarely before has a single calendar year in India been so monumental in terms of statues razed, erected, imagined and re-imagined. For instance, few people outside Tripura knew that the state had a couple of Vladimir Lenin statues. Mobs of vandals, allegedly from the BJP, toppled the Russian revolutionary from the two pedestals he stood on in March, soon after the 25-year-old Communist Party of India (Marxist) rule in Tripura fell to the BJP. ""When you build a statue, you resurrect an era. When you destroy one, you end an era,"" says Visvanathan of that moment of destruction in Tripura. (This writer made several calls to BJP's Sunil Deodhar, who was the party in-charge of Tripura, and sent text messages to him as well as to three of his personal assistants but did not get any response.)

There is more to this cult of statues. It is unabashedly masculine. This gender incongruity hasn't passed unnoticed.

On 12 December, Congress veteran Karan Singh, who is also a scholar on Hinduism, wrote to Yogi Adityanath urging him to cut down the height of the proposed Ram statue by half and build a statue to the couple, Sita and Ram.

""I was travelling in and around Simaria in Bihar which is part of the Mithila kingdom and it is the land of Sita mata. It struck me that she had a tragic life. Soon after her marriage, she joins prabhu Ramchandra on his 14-year-long exile. She gets abducted by Ravana in the 14th year and the great war ensues. She returns to Ayodhya as the Maharani but is again condemned to live in the woods when she is pregnant. I felt we need to bring Sita mata home and give what is due to her in Ayodhya. So I wrote to Yogi ji and marked a copy to Modi ji too. I am awaiting their response,"" the Congress veteran told Mint.

Singh finds no fault with the torrent of grand statues. ""Hinduism has had this tradition of building magnificent temples. I don't condemn this idea even though there could be a political side to building these statues. But since Uttar Pradesh has decided to build a mega statue to Prabhu Ramchandra, why not pay Sita mata her due and why not resurrect this beautiful imagery of Sita-Ram,"" he says.

Statues quo ante

In the 2019 general election tussle between things Modi and un-Modi, the statues are likely to grow taller. Uttar Pradesh -- the state that will majorly determine whether Modi will rule India in 2019 -- and Maharashtra, which sends the next largest contingent of MPs to the Lok Sabha, will be the main theatres of this interplay between statues, temples and politics. The statues have already started serving as sites where alliances are made and unmade. In November, when the Patel statue was unveiled, it was practically a BJP event, or rather, a Modi event. But on 16 December, the unveiling of a statue of M. Karunanidhi, the late DMK supremo, in Tamil Nadu offered a stage from which the DMK chief M. K. Stalin proposed Congress president Rahul Gandhi, who was in attendance, as the opposition's prime ministerial candidate to take on Modi. Also, the politics around the statues has been as engrossing and polarizing, as have been most things since 2014. Says Palshikar, ""Statues are about politics, power, assertion and underlining the presence of specific ideas/social segments.""

Yet, Palshikar locates statue politics in the larger landscape of identity politics and the politics of memory. ""There have always been statues spread across the country and the purpose was not always only to memorialize, and even memorializing certain personalities does involve politics in the larger sense. As a country and society, we are rather over-fond of statues while the world over, statues would always demarcate both a national consensus at a given point and the elite's thinking at that time,"" he says.

A very instructive example are the statues that Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati built as a tribute to Ambedkar, to BSP founder Kanshiram, and to herself in Uttar Pradesh when she ruled the state between 2007 and 2012. The elephant is the election symbol of the BSP, a party Kanshiram founded to end the Brahminical hegemony over power. At the time, the BSP and Mayawati received much flak for this splurge of public money. In fact, the Samajwadi Party (SP), which came to power next, accused its predecessor of a ₹40,000 crore scam. But the BSP and the marginal intellectual support it had then justified the monuments as the ""re-assertion of the downtrodden and Dalits"" finding a concrete expression in their own iconography.

""Statues and memorials are a way of remembering history and understanding it in a symbolic manner. They also serve contemporary political purposes. In the case of Ambedkar, the reason why the BSP and the Amebdkarites would want his statues and memorials is because of the overall neglect of his role till recently,"" concurs Palshikar. But even this justification has its limits, he points out. ""For the downtrodden and for Ambedkar's followers, one way of fighting back the upper caste cultural assertions is to find counter to that. Having said this, it is at the same time a limited assertion because it reduces great figures like Phule or Ambedkar or Periyar to symbols and facilitates either amnesia about their ideas, or distortion and simplification,"" avers Palshikar."

""When people see the sculptures created out of trash they have thrown, they are not only wowed but think about how they can reduce the amount of waste they generate,"" says sculptor Jacob Jebaraj, who was part of several trash-to-art projects in the city.

At the beginning of the year, Goethe Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan organised DAMnedArt, an awareness project, which saw 13 installations themed on river restorations. Displayed at the Lalit Kala Akademi, city-based artist Parvathi Nayar created a huge kolam for the exhibit, made out of trash collected from the banks of the Adyar river -- empty bottles, discarded toothbrushes, bottle caps, and more. The installation, 'Invite/Refuse', was meant to be a stark reminder of the extent of damage caused to rivers.

That was just the start for Nayar, who spent the better part of the year getting trash together to create statement pieces. After her Cooum kolam, she called out to people across the city, inviting them to send in all their blue and white trash to create a wave of art. She placed bins on the Alliance Francaise premises where people brought in bags of monochrome trash, which she then turned into a 135sqft installation, displayed at Veda Art Gallery.

""The project brought together contemporary aesthetics, trash collection and people across all walks of life to make art,"" said Nayar, who was assisted by the voluntary beach clean-up crew Angels of Marina as well as eco-conscious apartment building association heads. The result was a giant wave based on 19th century Japanese artist Hokusai's woodblock but made of milk packets, cleaning liquid bottles, and restaurant food containers. ""The waves are a powerful image in this city, which was devastated by a tsunami in 2004. The city is now drowning in a tsunami of trash,"" says Nayar.

In November, artist S Potrasan went on an ECR beach cleaning drive to pick up booze bottles, which he then turned into art. The in-house artist at DakshinaChitra now plans to conduct workshops in schools on decorating ceramic pieces with recycled glass.

At the Integral Coach Factory (ICF) in Perambur, wheels, drill bits and nuts and bolts were turned into gods, goddesses and butterflies as more than a dozen artists came together to create magic with metal scrap, which was then displayed at the Rail Museum and on Konnur High Road. Chennai sculptors like B O Shailesh, Jebaraj, Benita Perciyal, A V Ilango, Shalini Biswajit, Ravindran, and Asma Menon were part of this project. Jebaraj says displaying scrap art in public spaces has created a greater awareness of the genre. ""Schools and other institutes have approached me to create junk art installations at their premises,"" says Jebaraj, adding that word is spreading to tier 2 cities as well. He has already conducted talks at engineering colleges on scrap sculpture, and is working on another for a school and a mall.

""It is amazing the things we can do with twisted, scrap metal. If I see scrap anywhere now, I see art,"" says artist Thejomaye Menon, who worked on the ICF exhibits."

The parent of the 17-year-old alleged on Friday that the school staff had insulted her in the classs due to which she ended her life. ""The parents have alleged that the girl was laughing with one her friends in the class when one of the teachers scolded her. She went upstairs to the fourth floor and jumped off,"" said an official.

Sikar city CO, Girdhari Lal Sharma told TOI that parents late afternoon had agreed for the post-mortem and efforts are being made to speak to them about the girl's last rites. ""We have registered a case against the principal and the school staff based on her father's FIR, a case of murder has been registered and we are investigating the case,"" Sharma said.

The father in her report to the police alleged foul play and said that the school staff had kept the family in dark about their daughter's death. ""The family alleged that at 10 am they had received a call from the school that their daughter is laughing and talking in the class. The mother said to have even apologized, but a few hour later they were informed that their daughter has sustained some injuries and was rushed to the hospital,"" an official told TOI, adding that her father has also complained that the school's conduct during the entire tragic incident was highly suspicious.

Sources in Sikar police said that there was winter vacation in the school but extra classes were in progress due to board examination. The police have also recorded statements of the school's staff and student while a CCTV footage from first floor of the school has been retrieved. Initial probe has revealed that two members of the cleaning staff from the ground had spotted the girl standing on the edge of school terrace. They had also clicked her photo and quickly alerted the school staff but the student had already jumped off the building.

""We have learnt that she had scored very good marks in class X, but the family has alleged that she was asked to leave the class room which humiliated her. We are investigating the case,"" the official said."

The year 2018 is significant for Indian IT services companies on many counts as it is the period when the sector witnessed its growth bouncing back after initial hiccups. This was mainly on account of a huge push towards enhancing digital offerings.

It is also the period when most Indian IT majors, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, Wipro and HCL Technologies, made huge inroads into the US, by far the largest market, for establishing a strong local employee base. This was to largely deal with immigration-related uncertainties under the Trump administration.

Indian IT services players not only improved their pace of local hirings in the US this year but also announced local innovations centres to attract and train talent while rebadging client employees to bolster their presence in the country.

Many of them also took the nearshoring route by establishing delivery centres in countries like Mexico and Canada to service US clients in the same time zone.

The country's largest IT services firm, TCS, for example, said 20 per cent of its total hiring this year was done in the US alone.

Between 2011 and 2017, the company created 17,000 jobs in the US. Similarly, Infosys has already hired 7,000 in the US during the last 18 months with plans to add another 3,000 by early next year. The Bengaluru-headquartered firm also opened three innovation hubs in that country,including a massive training centre in Indianapolis. Its cross town peer, Wipro, which already has around 8,500 local employees in the US, is also giving an aggressive push to local hiring.

HCL Technologies has improved the ratio of locals in its US workforce to around 65 per cent, said to be the highest in the industry. The company has more than 17,000 staff members in US.

""A vast majority of the new recruitment has taken place outside India for client-facing works.

If you see, hiring percentage for onsite (this year) is higher than that in India,"" said Sanjoy Sen, doctoral research scholar at Aston Business School, the UK. ""Also, there is a lot of more emphasis on robotics and automation initiatives that eliminate human intervention for doing repetitive jobs on client geographies.""

Driven by the 'hire American' policy under the new political regime, the US government this year proposed sweeping changes to the H-1B visa regulations. Popular among Indian IT companies and professionals, the H1B visa allows US companies to employ foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise, for a shorter term. According to US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), there are as many as 419,637 foreign nationals working in the US on H-1B visas as on October this year. Out of this, 309,986 are Indians with majority of them being software engineers.

""Indian IT firms are diverting actual investments in building delivery centres in smaller cities in the US which provides foundations for increasing US headcount,"" said Hansa Iyengar, senior analyst at London-based Ovum Research.

ALSO READ: Trump's plan: H-1B visa only for most-skilled, highest-paid foreign workers

With increased hiring in the US, Indian IT firms have also started reducing their dependency on H-1B visas. According to a Kotak Institutional Equities report, H-1B applications by tier-I IT companies have reduced dramatically with Wipro's being the lowest at 400 this year. ""None of the companies are reliant on fresh H-1Bs for staffing projects in the US,"" the report said.

Apart from hiring locals, these companies are also opting for nearshoring route to serve clients in this country. Nearshoring is an outsourcing model wherein IT firms establish delivery presence in countries and locations closer to the client geography and depute employees working in those centres to service clients whenever there is a need.

This year, many mid-sized IT firms have gone on record saying that they would opt for the nearshoring route to service clients in the US.

For instance, Hexaware had said it would use its Mexico centre to service its US clients. Similarly, Tech Mahindra is setting up a centre of excellence in Canada with an investment of $(Canadian) 100 million to build technology solutions for clients in this region. This trend has been reflected in the numbers with India surpassing Philippines to send the highest number of immigrants to Canada in 2017."

But security moved in almost immediately and started pulling students away, forcing some to the ground while others were pushed towards a waiting black car.

Children have an inherent capacity for innovation and that should be encouraged, says Robinson. Talking about the present education system, he adds, ""Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects...""

There have been countless debates on the impact of the education system on children. While most parents rely on schools, some parents are adopting innovative methods of teaching children, from virtual learning to homeschooling. But how do we ensure a particular method of teaching is ideal for a child? Here are three Ted Talks that will answer your questions on how to effectively teach a child.

Kids can teach themselves

In this Ted Talk, educational researcher Sugata Mitra shares how kids figured out how to use a computer on their own and taught other children, as part of one of his projects. ""He (a school drop-out) started to fiddle around with the touchpad...Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen, and he was browsing: he was going back and forth. When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children, like, children would come and see what's happening over here. And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing,"" he reveals.

Mitra repeated the experiment with other children and found ""that six- to 13-year-olds can self-instruct in a connected environment, irrespective of anything that we could measure. So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.""

Do schools kill creativity?

Creativity expert Sir Ken Robinson, in his Ted Talk, makes a case for developing an education system that nurtures creativity. Children have an inherent capacity for innovation and that should be encouraged, says Robinson. Talking about the present education system, he adds, ""Every education system on Earth has the same hierarchy of subjects. There isn't an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics. Why? Why not? I think this is rather important. I think math is very important, but so is dance. Children dance all the time if they're allowed to, we all do...""

Let's teach for mastery-not test scores

Education has become more about securing good marks in an examination rather than focusing on learning the subject well. In this Ted Talk, educator Sal Khan, shares how students can be turned into scholars by helping them master concepts at their own pace. And how will that help them? ""One, the students can actually master the concepts, but they're also building their growth mindset, they're building grit, perseverance, they're taking agency over their learning. And all sorts of beautiful things can start to happen in the actual classroom. Instead of it being focused on the lecture, students can interact with each other. They can get deeper mastery over the material,"" adds Khan."

This series will focus on new-age militancy and the changing political landscape in the Valley, as well as the ever-increasing gap between the three regions of Jammu and Kashmir.

Arif Ali walks through a small market in his native Redwani village of south Kashmir with a toy pistol is tucked into his socks. He looks over his shoulder, and sees an army vehicle parked at the edge of a road. This is not a comforting sign, so he looks down till he reaches the edge where a small lane takes him to his school. The school is a small, two-storey building. His friends are waiting outside. All of them laugh. With the army vehicle out of sight, Arif breathes a sigh of relief. ""So our mujahid is alive today,"" Zameer, his friend, a Class 6 student said, raising his fist. ""I made it, like I always do, without getting checked,"" Arif responded.

A popular game among schoolchildren in south Kashmir is bringing a wooden gun or toy pistol without getting caught by teachers or security forces. Which is what Arif was doing one morning even as the sounds of schoolchildren rented the air in Kulgam's Qaimoh area.

As Jammu and Kashmir went through record levels of violence this year, its impact on children of the Valley is perhaps its least discussed phenomenon. It is the children that have bore the brunt of the violence and their daily lives are also shaped by it. The children born at the end of the century, many years after the conflict seemed to be ebbing, are also the most politically radicalised. The conflict -- with its lexicon -- has taken over their lives.

One recent morning, I followed Arif from his home to see how everyday conflict shapes the lives of Kashmir's children. Every conversation for next six hours involved mujahid, military, mukbeer (informer), guns, graveyard, hide (hideout), janaza (funeral) and such words. ""Our heroes are Burhan, Majid, Sadaam,"" Arif said. Walking back from his school, he counts the militants killed this year and last year. ""They fought for us and stood up for us. They are living with us. They are not dead.""

In the past few years, as the conflict raged in Kashmir, particularly in southern part of the Valley, I visited four districts of southern Kashmir almost every week. My first sources of information and guides have always been children. I speak to them because their version of events is unadulterated. They tell you exactly what happened, the names of those killed, how, why and when, and who was killed where. Just few kilometres away, in the village of Kapran, Insha Nissar Dobi plays with her younger brother Taban Nissar. She was orphaned when militants kidnapped her father, a police constable, and then killed him in September. Insha has become the anchor of her family, fulfilling his role and taking up his duties.

""I can't bring my father back, but I can help fill the void he left behind,"" Insha, a Class 12 student said. That means looking after her brother, mother, and her aged grandparents. It has also brought, on her tender shoulders, the responsibility of going to the market to buy everyday items and maintaining the orchards which help pay the bills. ""Everyone is fighting to survive,"" Insha said, sitting on the verandah of her home in Kapran village. ""My father became a casualty of a war that unfortunately swallowed many lives. Regardless of who dies, it is the people of Kashmir who continue to suffer.""

Kashmiri children who have been brought up under the shadow of gun are perishing under it. Their lives, even in their games, are heavily militarised. In thick apple orchards, they play a game called ""mujahid vs army"" where playing the part of the soldier is a curse. Look at any encounter site, post gun battle: children are the first to enter the razed homes. They collect empty cartridges, and keep them in their pockets to tell the stories later. Many wear rings made of bullets on their left fingers: part fashion, part mini-rebellion.

In these parts of Kashmir, India is the paramilitary soldier with a rifle slung over his shoulder, the army soldier who arrives in dead of night hunting for militants. Or the policeman -- a Kashmiri -- who represents India. Tragically, for decades India has allowed itself to be represented in Kashmir by the barrel of gun: of which children are recurring victims. These children are the ones who have borne the brunt of the ongoing crises. But never before have so many children been thus affected. Many hate India and everything that India represents. Their mobile phones are filled with picture militants: dead and alive. Those who died find a place in their memories. Those that survive are role models (for want of any better choices). No young, mainstream Kashmiri politician or Hurriyat leader can even come close to the popularity of militants.

Till 23 December, at least 247 militants were killed across India: most of them from Kashmir. About 25 commanders of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammad and Ansarul Ghazwatul Hind (AGH) of Zakir Musa were killed in encounters with security forces. And of the 87 security men killed this year, 45 were Kashmiri policemen. Children can be seen at every militant funeral: from performing last rites to helping dig graves. At a graveyard in Karimabad, after seven civilians were killed by forces in the adjoining Sirnoo village of Pulwama, Sadiq Rasheed sat silently near the grave of his neighbour. A shy, lean boy, Sadiq looked at -- for hours -- the poster of dead militants hanging from a tree.

""We knew them all,"" Sadiq said. ""Our lives are filled with graveyards. They died one after another, but we will remember their sacrifices forever. We will not forget that they gave their lives for a better tomorrow.""

The genre has come into focus this year in the city with a host of comic art festivals, collectives and platforms giving it the much-needed impetus. Bengaluru hosted its first-ever independent comic festival - Indie Comix Fest earlier this year, following it up with The Comix Courtyard, another festival serving the cause of independent comic artists.

Interestingly, Bengaluru hosted two design festivals this year in quick succession. Bangalore Design Week in September and Bengaluru by Design in November tried to create a discourse around design through panel discussions, showcase, installations, workshops and screenings etc.

Important retrospectives

Artistic careers of a few seminal artists unfolded at National Gallery of Modern Art Bengaluru this year. This line-up included Balan Nambiar, SG Vasudev, Jitender Arya and the ongoing one by JS Khanderao.

* Exhibiting his work of six decades which included stainless-steel sculptures, watercolours, enamels and oil paintings, Balan showed his photographs depicting 27 different ritual arts of Kerala and Tulu Nadu and enamels for the first time.

* ""Inner Resonance: A Return to Sama"" was SG Vasudev's retrospective exhibiting his crucial works - paintings, drawings, tapestries and copper reliefs from different stages of his career. works, forging connections.

* ""Through the Window"" by JS Khanderao shows realistic portraits, paintings and landscapes that Khanderao is known for. A remarkable teacher, Khanderao established 'The Ideal Fine Art Society' in 1963 in Gulbarga.

* Jitender Arya's ""Light Works"" traced the evolution of glamour photography in India through the late photographer's images of musicians, models and film actors.

* JMS Mani's retrospective at Gallery Time and Space also drew attention to the artist's eclectic oeuvre which showcased the realistic representation of rustic life of Badami, prints, watercolours and drawings.

New initiatives

Nazariya, a Delhi-based platform to promote folk traditions launched the Forgotten Cultures Workshop Series in Bengaluru, with a Cheriyal workshop by Nagilla Ganesh at the Courtyard on KH Road. The cultural outfit plans to hold workshops of different art forms in the city, regularly.

* AWN - Artists for Wildlife and Nature, an online platform was formed this year by Bengaluru-based Prasad Natarajan, to bring such practitioners together. The outfit has had two shows in the city so far.

Found!

* Though several artists pass out of art colleges and take to art every year, Puia's makes s a rather intriguing case. A former watchman at the construction site of Chickpet Metro Station, Puia's potential as an artist was discovered by artists working on the murals at the metro station. After training under the artists, Puia from Mizoram helped them with the Bangalore Karaga Project commissioned by BMRCL.

* AWN - Artists for Wildlife and Nature, an online platform was formed this year by Bengaluru-based Prasad Natarajan, to bring such practitioners together. The outfit has had two shows in the city so far.

Accolades

Bengaluru-based artist Sangeeta Abhay featured in the third episode of a significant BBC documentary called Civilisation, which was telecast in the US earlier this year. The BBC was looking for a contemporary Indian artist inspired by ancient art and Sangeeta fit the bill. The film shows her at the World heritage site of Ajanta and Ellora talking about Buddha and his influence on her art.

Venkatappa Art Gallery in the dock, once again

The iconic art institution has once again become a bone of contention between the artists and the government. With the State Tourism department planning to demolish VAG on Kasturba Gandhi Road as the structure was found to be weakened upon inspection, the artists are once again up in arms, asking the government to revamp the building instead of razing it. The building was saved by the group of artists just a couple of years back when the Siddaramaiah Government had signed an MOU with Tasveer Foundation to set up Museum of Art and Photography (MAP). After non-stop protests by the community of artists, the government had to relent. Now the said MAP is coming up right opposite VAG.

Rumale Art Gallery being revamped

Rumale Channabasavaiah, known as the Vincent Van Gogh of India, has a quaint space dedicated to his art in Rajajinagar. The gallery has been revamped with professional lighting and a proper display system for the 120 paintings of different sizes, by Sanjay Kabe, Rumale's close friend's son. The site was alloted to Rumale by the government where he later build a house for himself and lived with his friend and friend's family.

Other important shows

* RMZ Foundation is walking a unique path since its inception in 2016. This year it has engaged with two unique mediums of prints and sculptures. It has held printmaking workshops and sculpture symposiums with artists from all across the country. During the course of the workshops, school students and public are encouraged to come and interact with the artists.

* The exhibition ""Only A Mind Cannot be Sent Into Exile"" by artist Veer Munshi dealt with Kashmir. Through paintings, photographs-based video work and sound pieces, Veer, who draws his roots from the Valley, he brought out various expressions on conflict.

* Another show that struck a chord was a photography exhibition ""Land and Lens"" by first-time photographers from the villages of Chamarajnagar and Sirsi. Organised by two NGOs Vanastree and Punarchith, the photographs were taken by people, who held a professional camera for the first time in their life like school headmasters, farmers, daily wage labourers, homemakers and auto-rickshaw drivers.

* The fact that Ganjifa, the ancient card game is now being reclaimed as an art form was attested by a mammoth event organised by Karnataka Chitrakala Parishath (CKP). Around 150 ganjifa exhibits, live demonstrations, seminars, a Ramsons stall selling traditional board games were part of the exercise.

* This year started with a stunning show of ceramics by Gallery Manora ""Bowl'd Over"". You don't come across this medium often and what added to it was how 10 artists took a bowl and unleashed their imagination."

This includes collecting books and refurbishing lost libraries. ""Each book you donate can help in bringing back life to a damaged library or towards the renovation of the same,"" said Evan Cyril, project coordinator.

The organisers are also working hand in hand with students to find out their academic needs. ""Sahridhaya, as the name suggests, inspires to feel humane and to humanise others. We not only motivate others to donate books but also encourage people to develop the habit of reading. Along with providing children with books, we also supply stationery including pen, pencil, geometry box and bags,"" said Abhijith Renjith, event coordinator.

Collection points have been set up in different parts of the city including the Mall of Travancore, Technopark, Vazuthacaud and Statue. The book drop-off points are located in prime regions of the city, making it easy for the public to donate.

""During the floods, piles of books were soiled and soaked in water. In Thiruvananthapuram, we have identified few schools including Carmel Girls Higher Secondary School, Thycaud and Holy Angels School. In the initial phase, the plan is to build two libraries for any two schools,"" added Evan.

'Sahridhaya' have also introduced an online library challenge aimed at collecting 5,000 books by January 2019. ""Social media platforms have been used to spread awareness regarding the same. We have introduced a hashtag campaign, #giftasmile2.0 for Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. After donating a book, you are requested to forward the same message along with the hashtag to 10 of your friends by January,"" added Abhijith.

The NGO also plans to build science labs in the second phase of the campaign and set up a parking slot in the third phase for flood-affected schools. According to the coordinators, the 'Gift A Smile', the campaign will be completed in 10 months time.

What did the flood give you? A new perspective; An open mind; It taught me what people are and how meaningless our fights in the name of religion are; A new hope; A broken home.

What did the flood take away from you? My dream; It took away my flower and vegetable garden. We lost all of our hens and also our loving dog.

Printed in both English and Malayalam, these are samplings of the questions and the responses to them that hang from clotheslines in Mexican artist Monica Mayer's installation at the ongoing fourth edition of the Kochi-Muziris Biennale. Mayer is a feminist whose art, activism, blogs, newspaper column, books and performances, often in collaboration with other artists, are centred around the hazards, oppressions, tribulations and crises that women and the marginalised people in her country and elsewhere face daily.

After the catastrophic earthquake in Mexico in 2017, Mayer had posed similar questions to those who suffered, and that elicited replies very much like those voiced by the recent Kerala flood survivors. The direct reference to the deluge in Mayer's biennale project, The Clothesline, was echoed in the address of V Venu, former principal secretary of Kerala and CEO of ""Rebuild Kerala"" Committee, at the talk Art in Difficult Times, organised by BMW : ""It is a celebration of the resilience of the state and its people and also of art.""

This is also in keeping with the belief of Anita Dube, the biennale's first woman curator, that ""through the potential of social action, coming together, we ask and search for questions, critical questions, in the hope of dialogue.""

Mayer could not make it to Kochi for health reasons. In an interview over the phone and by email, she spoke about her art and her activism. Quite at variance with the image of the po-faced activist, Mayer can make light of the most serious issues, as demonstrated by her in Madres, a prime-time TV programme she produced in collaboration with colleague Maris Bustamante in the 1980s, in which a male celebrity TV anchor is made ""pregnant"". It was an effort to make public what is considered a private experience. ""In my work there is an overlapping of art, activism and pedagogy. The Clothesline, for example, has been used as all three,"" she reflects.

Mayer was born in 1954 in Mexico City. When she was training as an artist there, women artists were invisible. Even Frida Kahlo was known then only as the wife of muralist Diego Rivera. In art school, the ""progressive"" male peers told the women they were less creative because ""they lost their creativity with motherhood."" These ""unscientific and dumb"" comments pushed her to join Woman's Building, a feminist art school in Los Angeles.

In 1978, Mayer was invited to participate in an exhibition at Mexico City's Museum of Modern Art that featured performance and installation art. The theme was 'The City', and that's when she decided to do El Tendedero (The Clothesline). She asked women what they disliked about the city. ""I moved around in public transport all the time and sexual harassment is very bad. At the time not even the feminist groups were talking about this issue because there were very, very few of us and we were dealing with issues such as abortion, forced sterilisation and rape. The shape of the clothesline, apart from aesthetic issues, represented a traditionally female activity, but also reflected a basic activity in the feminist movement... allowing us to learn to speak up and also listen to each other,"" she says.

Mayer has worked individually, collectively and collaboratively. Her two longest collaborations were with Bustamante, with whom she founded the first feminist art group in Mexico, the Polvo de Gallina Negra, which means 'black hen powder' -- a means of protection against ""evil"" eye, according to local belief. ""We felt it was difficult to be an artist in Mexico, harder to be a woman artist but almost impossible to be a feminist artist, so we decided to give our group a name to protect us.""

In Pinto mi Raya, Mayer and Víctor Lerma, a Mexico City-based contemporary artist, put together a performance titled Abrazos (Hugs). ""We asked our friends in Mexico to share stories of the most important hugs for them and we take them to these other contexts. One of us 'narrates' the hug, and the other one gives it. It is a simple gesture of recognition and sharing as human beings,"" says Mayer. They have performed in other countries too, on invitation, but say it is ""strange"" for them to do the piece in another context and country on short notice, because they work specifically with the art community in Mexico.

When Mayer was invited to the Kochi Biennale, she was perplexed because she did not know either the context or the local language (Malayalam). ""But sharing experiences can build a bridge between our cultures even if we are at the other side of the world. I asked my friends through Facebook to share their experience about the earthquake... and I asked the team at Kochi to get in touch with flood victims,"" she says."

The construction of the building was started on 32.15 acres of land on May 21, 2015. Although the building was supposed to be completed by October 20, 2016, the construction agency finished the work a year later. As a result, classes could not be started in 2017 academic session.

The best thing about mistakes is that one learns something from them. However, that lesson can be costly and unrepairable if that is learnt from your wrong investment decisions. A prudent man can't avoid the taxes, but he can surely reduce them by learning from the mistakes of others.

Tax planning is a legitimate process to reduce one's tax liability by availing all the permissible allowances, deductions, exemptions and rebates. Some of these benefits accrue after the fulfilment of certain conditions. In this article, we shall discuss about the investment-linked tax deductions and the common mistakes a taxpayer generally makes.

One should align one's tax planning with long-term financial goals. Tax-saving is an important part of overall financial planning and should ideally be planned throughout the year. Three-fourth of the current fiscal year is over and taxpayers are now left with just 3 months to plan or re-arrange their tax affairs.

Taxpayers generally ignore the important factors, i.e., return on investment, liquidity, etc., while making the investment decisions and have an eye on the quantum of tax savings. One should always distinguish between the end goal and auxiliary benefits of an investment. The end goal should be return on investment and building corpus for the future, and auxiliary benefits should be tax savings. In a nut-shell, even if you have not made any tax-saving investment, don't go for it in great haste. Make an informed decision by avoiding the following common mistakes:

Section 80C is a common provision for pool of investments with an overall deduction limit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. We have witnessed that due to lack of awareness, taxpayers keep investing in all those options which are eligible only for deduction under Section 80C, i.e., insurance policies, FDs, ELSS, etc. Consequently, the limit prescribed under Section 80C is fully exhausted, while as other deductions remain unutilized. So, to get most of deductions, diversify your investment portfolio and spending. Any contribution to the NPS is eligible for Section 80CCD deductions and payment for health insurance premium and preventive health checkup expenses give you Section 80D deduction.

So, first make a list of all deductions that could be availed during the year and the investment that would be eligible for such deductions. Check your salary slips, bank statements and credit card statements to find out if there are any investments that are already eligible for deductions, i.e., housing loan EMI, contribution to PF, children's school fees, etc. If some deficit remains, then plan for making further investments.

Taxpayers generally have the sole intention of tax saving while making any investment. They ignore the factors of return and risk factors. Tax saving can't be an end result, it is an ancillary benefit we achieve when we choose an investment plan. Wisely choose the investment options by taking into account the options available, assured returns, previous years' return, etc., so as to minimize the tax liability and to increase the returns.

For example, you have an option to invest in bank FDs, PPF or NSC. All of these investments are eligible for Section 80C deductions. The factors to choose the right investment plan should be the lock-in period, rate of return and risk factors. All of them are completely secure. FDs and NSCs have a lock-in period of 5 years, whereas the PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years. In terms of interest, NSCs and PPFs provide the same rate of interest (8% w.e.f. October 1, 2018), whereas SBI offers 6.85% on 5-year FDs. If the term of investment is not a deciding factor for an investor, PPF would be a better investment opportunity for him as the interest earned on PPF is tax free whereas interest earned on NSC is chargeable to tax. Thus, while making tax planning one should consider the financial goals along with tax saving.

The government always pushes for digital payments as they can be traced back to check any false claim. Many sections allow deduction or exemption only when the investment is made by any mode other than cash. Before making payment for any investment, a taxpayer should always check if payment in cash would be eligible for deduction. Example, Section 80D allows deduction for medical insurance premium only if it is paid through banking channels. Similarly, Section 80G restricts deductions for any donation in excess of Rs 10,000 if it is made by way of cash payments.

The most common mistake a taxpayer commits is planning investments in the last quarter of the year. He ends up with investments in less-yielding schemes or schemes which are not eligible for deduction. Thus, to avoid bad investments, start your tax planning from the start of the year. Before making any investment, one should evaluate all the available avenues thoroughly. It is important for a taxpayer to invest in multiple schemes so as to diversify the investment portfolio. If you have not yet done tax planning for the year 2018-19, you should plan your investments according to your financial goals and reduce your tax liability instead of delaying it any more.

Most of the people don't even know that the expenses they incur in their day-to-day lives can also help them save taxes. They often ignore the regular expenses made during the year which are eligible for deductions. So, you should first learn about all the expenses which qualify for deductions. Example, tuition fees, medical expenditure, stamp duty and registration fees paid on purchase of immovable property, donations, interest on housing loans, etc. So, keep a track of all eligible expenses made during the year along with their receipts so as to claim deductions in such respect at the end of the year. Just because of such ignorance we end up paying higher taxes, even though we could have saved them.

As it is almost the end of third quarter of fiscal, buckle up and start planning wisely for your taxes and investments. Plan wisely, evaluate rationally and execute brilliantly to maximize returns and minimize the tax burden. Remember that your best teacher is your last mistake and don't repeat a mistake twice."
"102","1028057645","2018-12-28","https://www.gqindia.com/content/future-crime-fighting-family-tree-forensics/","The future of crime-fighting is family tree forensics","GQ India",FALSE,"In April, a citizen scientist named Barbara Rae-Venter used a little-known genealogy website called GEDMatch to help investigators find a man they'd been looking for for nearly 40 years: The Golden State Killer. In the months since, law enforcement agencies across the country have flocked to the technique, arresting a flurry of more than 20 people tied to some of the most notorious cold cases of the last five decades. Far from being a forensic anomaly, genetic genealogy is quickly on its way to becoming a routine police procedure. At least one company has begun offering a full-service genetic genealogy shop to law enforcement clients. And Rae-Venter's skills are in such high demand that she's started teaching her secrets to some of the biggest police forces in the US, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Identifying individuals from their distant genetic relatives, a technique called long-range familial searching, is a potent alternative to the types of DNA searches commonly available to cops. Those are typically limited to forensic databases, which can only identify close kin -- a sibling, parent, or child -- and are highly regulated. No court order is required to mine GEDMatch's open source trove of potential leads, which, unlike forensic databases, contains genetic bits of code that can be tied to health data and other personally identifiable information.

Currently, there aren't any laws that regulate how law enforcement employs long-range familial searching, which hobbyists and do-gooders have turned to for years to find the biological families of adoptees. But some legal experts argue its use in criminal cases raises grave privacy concerns. They expect to see a legal challenge at some point, though probably not in the next year. In the meantime, GEDMatch is becoming even more powerful, as it grows by nearly a thousand new uploads every day. And with hundreds more cases currently in the hands of full-time family-tree builders, one thing's for sure: In 2019, genealogy is going to send a lot more people to jail.

It was the last Saturday of June and CeCe Moore had been working on her couch, hunched over her laptop for 16 hours straight. The month before, the genetic genealogist had been hired by a forensic DNA company in Virginia called Parabon, to lead its new division devoted to long-range familial searching. She was immersed in a case out of Fort Wayne, Indiana; In the spring of 1998, eight-year-old April Tinsley went missing from her home. Three days later, a jogger discovered her body in a ditch on DeKalb County Road 68, about 20 miles outside of town. She had been raped and strangled to death.

For years, Tinsley's killer haunted that northeastern corner of Indiana, leaving messages scrawled on a barn bragging of his crime. In 2004, four threatening notes appeared on bicycles owned by young girls that had been left in their yards. The notes, which were claimed to be written by the same person that killed Tinsley, were placed inside baggies alongside used condoms. The semen matched DNA found in Tinsley's underwear.

This summer, Indiana investigators extracted DNA from the original crime scene and sent it to Parabon. There, the company reverse-engineered the information into a DNA data profile similar to what you would get back from consumer genetics companies like 23andMe or Ancestry. Then they uploaded it to GEDMatch and waited for a match. They got 12. Twelve relatives, ranging from fifth to third cousins.

So that's where Moore started, that weekend in June. The cousins represented four different family trees containing thousands of people, all of which somehow had to tie into the Fort Wayne killer. The first thing she did was work backward in time to locate ancestors from whom the suspect and the 12 matches were both descended. Eventually she found four couples, born between 1809 and 1849. Once she had them, she could move forward in history, building out family trees of every generation until the present. She did this by tracking names and faces through census records, newspaper archives, school yearbooks, and social media.

By the time night fell over her home in San Diego, she had begun to close in on a single branch, into which the four genetic tributaries all ran. From there things moved quickly. As the clock ticked past midnight, she found the relatives that had struck out for Indiana. It didn't take much longer to circle in on two brothers who lived in the area where Tinsley was murdered. Full siblings are as close as genetic genealogy can get. But Moore had a hunch. One brother struck her as a recluse; he had no wife or kids, he lived in a trailer, there were no pictures of him anywhere, and his family never mentioned him on Facebook.

Moore laid this all out for the Indiana investigators. A few days later they came back to her with a photo of one of the two brothers, with a hand-written note underneath. She gasped. ""I thought it was him, but I wasn't sure until I saw his writing,"" Moore says. ""It was the same as those notes and that barn.""

Indiana authorities staked out the trailer the first week of July and collected a piece of trash with the suspect's DNA on it. Lab tests confirmed that the DNA recovered from the condoms in 2004, and the crime scene in 1988, belonged to the same man: 59-year-old John Dale Miller. Police arrested him July 15th. According to local reports, when the police asked him why they were at his home, Miller replied, ""April Tinsley."" On Friday, December 7, Miller pled guilty in the Allen County Courthouse to murder and child molestation, as part of a plea agreement. On December 21, a judge sentenced him to 80 years in prison.

Miller is the first person genetic genealogy has put away for good. There could soon be others. Parabon has made public its involvement in 20 ""solved"" cases so far, with eight more undisclosed. Of those, at least four of the suspects were already deceased. The company was able to get up and running quickly after the Golden State Killer news broke the ice, because it had already created 100 or so genetic profiles through its phenotyping service, which creates a composite image from DNA for police to circulate in hopes of getting a lead. After hiring Moore, they quickly brought on three more genetic genealogists over the summer, and are in the process of hiring one more. The company says it's now uploaded 200 profiles to GEDMatch, which represent cold cases from nearly as many law enforcement agencies scattered around the US. Parabon is actively working on 40 such cases.

Some of those include active cases, not just crimes committed decades ago. For example, in April, exactly a week before the Golden State Killer announcement, a man broke into a residence in the red-rocked southern Utah town of St. George, and sexually assaulted the 79-year-old woman who lived there. Three months later, authorities arrested a suspect, Spencer Glen Monnett, based on Moore's genetic detective work. She says everyone clears their schedules to prioritize any active cases. At the moment, Parabon is working on at least one other active case involving a serial offender, but the company expects it to become a bigger part of what they do in 2019.

""In these active cases that come back with no match in CODIS [the federal offender database], law enforcement are realizing they don't have to wait until every last avenue has been exhausted before coming to us,"" says Ellen Greytak, who runs the company's advanced DNA services division. ""Genetic genealogy can be a tool to use right away.""

Rae-Venter, the genetic genealogist who cracked the Golden State Killer case, has also begun taking on active cases, with a small team of volunteers who mostly work pro bono. Right now she's spending 12 to 15 hours a day, six days a week trying to track down a serial rapist who is still out there committing crimes. In addition to that one, her consultancy group is working through a backlog of 25 to 30 more cold cases. And she's still collaborating closely with the Sacramento County detectives she joined forces with on the GSK case. Rae-Venter says a large part of their queue are referrals from the FBI.

Indeed, the feds can't seem to get enough of her. Earlier this year, The FBI flew Rae-Venter to Houston, Texas to give a seven hour presentation on genetic genealogy to a room of 100 people -- mostly federal agents, some local police officers, and even one Texas Ranger in a signature white rancher-style cowboy hat. ""It's really catching people's attention,"" she says. While family historians such as herself may be leading the way in this emerging field, she thinks it makes more sense to train, and perhaps even certify, law enforcement, rather than try to pull from the hobbyist community. Ultimately, she believes every major law enforcement agency will have its own specialists on staff. ""I think this belongs to detectives, not genealogists,"" says Rae-Venter.

As an example, she points to the arrest in September of the man believed to be the NorCal Rapist, another serial offender who terrorized victims in six California counties over a 15-year period beginning in 1991. Detectives from the Sacramento District Attorney's office, who Rae-Venter had trained, uploaded a genetic profile of the suspect and built out family trees on their own. According to the DA's office, they singled out the man arrested, Roy Charles Waller, in just 10 days.

Genetic geneology alone isn't enough to make an arrest. Investigators have to do confirmatory DNA testing, by retrieving bits of genetic material from the suspect, usually pulled from his or her trash, and comparing them to DNA found at the crime scene. But legal scholars worry that the widespread adoption of long-range familial searches will expose vast numbers of innocent people to genetic surveillance.

GEDMatch, which currently houses 1.2 million profiles from folks who've had their DNA analyzed at places like 23andMe and Ancestry, can now be used to identify at least 60 percent of all Americans with European Ancestry, regardless of whether they themselves have ever been tested. That's according to two recent analyses by genetics researchers, who expect databases like GEDMatch to grow so big in the next few years that it will be possible to find anyone from just their DNA, even if they haven't voluntarily put it in the public domain.

""You can't claw back the profile of your third cousin once removed who you don't even know exists,"" says Erin Murphy, a law professor at New York University Law School and an expert on familial DNA searches. If someone gets ensnared in a long-range familial search, she says, they're going to have very little legal recourse. ""These searches throw into sharp relief how current privacy protections under the 4th Amendment are insufficient to contend with what technologies are available to police in 2018.""

There's not a lot of data yet on whether the general public believes police should have access to non-criminal genetic databases. But initial surveys suggest that the majority of Americans are most supportive of such searches when they're used to go after violent offenders. Approval drops from 80 percent to less than 40 percent for pursuing people who've committed nonviolent crimes.

As long as genetic genealogy remains resource-intensive, it's unlikely to be used to catch thieves or drug-dealers. But even that appears to be changing. As more people send in their spit to DNA testing companies and upload their results to GEDMatch, matches will become more frequent. Curtis Rogers, the website's 80-year-old co-creator, says the site has grown by about 200,000 profiles since it changed its terms in May. And its search capabilities just got more powerful. Last week, Rogers' team of retired computer engineers rolled out an update that will let people see more matches with even more distant relatives. They also added a tool he calls ""revolutionary"" that will help sleuths decide if a small piece of DNA is a real match or just noise. Since the website's skeletal staff are mostly volunteers, the effort has taken about two years. But now that it's done, Rogers says they can start thinking about how to transform their hobby site, which resembles a Web 1.0 Wiki, into something more professional -- including adding backups and beefing up security. ""We want to make sure it's something that is around for the long term,"" he says."

This is what Dave McClure, the founder of business accelerator 500 Start-ups, has to say about start-ups. The launch journey of a start-ups sees maximum turmoil and therefore a helping hand is required to guide them through the fog. This is where incubators can make a huge difference in helping them navigate the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial world.

Prompt Investor connect, vibrant ecosystem, diverse and constant mentoring, world-class infrastructure, and free credit programmes, these are just a few of the advantages that a dedicated incubation programme like the AIC-NMIMS Incubation Centre offers. Housed in the heart of Mumbai, this state of the art incubation centre brings together the right mix of people, resources, and values, the programme seeks to build an innovative and collaborative ecosystem for young entrepreneurs to thrive.

This Incubation Centre has been set up with the support from 14 different schools under NMIMS University and Niti Aayog (Atal Innovation Mission) with the vision of promoting and creating an entrepreneurial community within the city of Mumbai. The AIC-NMIMS Incubation Centre launched its first cohort in the month of July with an overwhelming response of over 220 applications and started its centre with the first cohort of 10 start-ups.

The Incubation Centre is now calling for application for its second cohort of vibrant entrepreneurs hoping to build sustainable businesses. Click here to apply for the programme

According to CEO Harshal Shah, ""We are housed in the heart of a very vibrant multi-disciplinary ecosystem. This is largely because of the 14 colleges (business school, engineering, design, law) around us. All we needed to do, was connect the dots, to allow entrepreneurs, from across India, the benefits of this ecosystem. We want to build a centre, where we understand the pains and toil of starting a business and try to provide as much support as we can, to make this journey smooth and memorable.""

Yash Poojary, CEO of Capshun (building a platform, which uses Artificial Intelligence to enable millennials to give automated captions to a photo), an incubatee at the Centre, has this to say. ""During our beta testing phase, we came across AIC and were fortunate to get selected in their first cohort. NMIMS AIC not only has great mentor network through which various domain experts are called in, to guide and advise us on a weekly basis. They have also helped us in organizing various live feedback sessions for the app, which helped us immensely in improving our product and getting more insights. All in all, it was one of the best decisions for our start-up to join AIC!""

Dushyant, CEO of Gyanarth Technologies (uses Augmented Reality based 3D learning for education), another Incubatee, shared with us his experience. ""We needed to scale our operations and hence we applied to AIC. Currently AIC is helping us by providing Infrastructure to perform our development work and clients meetings, mentorship from Industry people across multiple domains, and network of related organization so that we can accomplish our mission of delivering Immersive learning experience to students across the nation.""

The good news for you young entrepreneurs, is that AIC NMIMS Incubation, is accepting applications again, for its second cohort. This Incubation Centre, is open for all and any entrepreneur, wishing to build a sustainable and innovative business.

Based on Booker Prize-winning author Aravind Adiga's 2016 fiction novel of the same name, the cricket drama follows the lives of two brothers -- Radha (debutant Yash Dholye) and Manju (played by Tumbbad's Mohammad Samad) and their struggles against their cricket-obsessed, overbearing father (Rajesh Tailang). Anand Tucker's Seven Stories and Anil Kapoor's Film and Communication Network have produced the series, which also stars Ratna Pathak Shah, Mahesh Manjrekar, Shiv Pandit and Karanvir Malhotra among others. This coming-of-age tale about two teen cricket prodigies has been adapted for screen by actor-writer Marston Bloom and it's directed by Indian-born British director Udayan Prasad and Karan Boolani.

Ahead of its worldwide release, Firstpost caught up with the team and finds Shiv Pandit (best known for his film Shaitan) most amused about his part as he calls himself, ""the latest god in town"". Shiv plays a quirky character of that of a God (Lord Subramanyam) who helps the teenage cricket aspirant (Manju) navigate through life. Ask Shiv if there was any reference point and he breaks into laughter saying, ""You can't use any reference when you have to play God because the idea of God is so subjective. To each of us, God has a very different visual representation. Also, the idea wasn't to present a different take on God. It's more of a visual representation of your innermost thoughts. He doesn't tell Manju 'do this' or 'do that'. He kind of bounces his thoughts off him and through that process, Manju figures it out himself.""

For Mohammad Samad (Manju), who has seen in Nawazuddin Siddiqui's Haraamkhor and most recently, Tumbbad, auditioning for the part was easy but playing cricket was tough. ""I'm into football and I have never played cricket. Even if I have tried my hands at the sport in the past, I have played real bad cricket, bad shots and I had got habituated to it. I had to train for two months and now I have started enjoying the sport,"" said Haridwar-bred Samad.

However, for debutant Yash Dholye, who plays Samad's elder brother, the sport was a cake-walk. ""The experience was great because personally too, I love cricket. In my first role I got to play the sport in a professional space, and then I also got to act, that combination is quite rare, not every aspiring actor gets this chance in the first job,"" said Dholye.

Samad and Dholye's on-screen rapport has come across pretty well and both attribute it to being just natural during the shoot. ""We didn't try hard at building rapport; we were natural. We would never plan or decide anything and just went with the flow with our training, workshops and reading with the director. Had we planned, it would have got boring,"" said the aspiring actors.

Making the distinction between big screen and web series, Samad said, ""One has to hold on to the character's arc for a longer time in a series. You can't plan what will be shot next and it gets decided suddenly, whereas in films there is a process. Then, in films you rehearse all alone but it is easier in series. Even while we were shooting, we would sit separately and rehearse so that the next scene gets better. We have had lot of fun and hope the audience also enjoys and stays connected with our characters just as we related to our characters very well.""

Actor-writer, Rajesh Tailang, who was recently seen in Netflix's gangster series Mirzapur and films like Aiyaary, Mukkabaaz and Omerta, couldn't relate to the character of that of an overbearing, cricket-obsessed father of Samad and Dholye. ""As an actor, I could identify my role but otherwise, I don't relate to the character and his feelings, his wants, his aspirations. It was a difficult task,"" said Tailang. When asked if he read the novel before the shoot and the seasoned actor said, ""No, I haven't because there's a difference between the novel and the screenplay and I didn't want to get confused between the two. I wanted to consult only the director.""

Further, talking about his role, Tailang said, ""The way it is seen in the script, he is a very strict, regimented father, very military like but he is justified because if in the world of cricket, in such a huge population, if only 11 candidates get selected then they have to work very hard from the time the child is born. It was a very meticulous plan, each and everything was planned with scientific and clinical approach. Emotions were kept aside like one is detached during an operation. Similarly, his children's emotions don't mean anything for the father. He is treating them like guinea pigs.""

Theatre actor Karanvir Malhotra, who is making his screen debut with Selection Day, plays a complex and grey character of a cricket team captain, named Javed Ansari. ""He (Javed) comes from an affluent background but he has faced a lot of tragedies in his childhood and because of that, he has shaped a certain defence mechanism where he bullies these two new kids (Manju and Radha) and makes fun of them. Because he doesn't want to get hurt himself and hence, before they try to hurt him, he wants to put them down. He is little arrogant, a bit of a spoilt brat but a sweetheart too,"" said Malhotra.

Perhaps, best known to the current generation for her role in the Indian sitcom Sarabhai vs Sarabhai and recent releases like Kapoor & Sons and Lipstick Under My Burkha, acting powerhouse Ratna Pathak Shah plays a supporting character named Nellie in the series, who is the principal at a prestigious fictitious Mumbai school. ""My part was very well written. It was an unusual one because an actress my age has fairly limited options as far as television and film is concerned. Either you are some strong neta (politician) type, or a rude bitch, or you are sobbing mother and weeping grandmother. Fortunately, I have been spared those kind of roles. This one was a very wonderful ride for me, because I know Nellie very well. I've seen many Nellies; I've interacted with many. I've lived with one as well, as my aunt Shanta Gandhi was a well-known educationist and hence I could relate to my character,"" said Ratna."

In Kerala, the Supreme Court judgement in the Sabarimala temple case on 28 September may have kindled a similar sense of deja vu among some. Three months on, the furore over granting women access to the centuries-old hilltop shrine refuses to die down.

Women of menstrual age had always been banned, at least in theory, from entering the Sabarimala shrine, perched on top of a hill surrounded by a lush green forest in South Kerala's Pathanamthitta district.

The ban was apparently in keeping with the wishes of the celibate deity of the temple. The Supreme Court, however, ruled that the ban was unconstitutional, violative of gender rights and equality, and ordered that women of all ages be allowed access.

The judgement almost immediately sparked protests -- so much so that the brotherhood and political coexistence that Kerala witnessed during the century's worst floods in August seems like an illusion now.

The pilgrim's burden

Sindujan, from Kerala's Palakkad district, went to Sabarimala at a particularly fraught time this year.

It was in October and, on the same day, Rehana Fathima, an activist claiming to be a devotee, was trying to visit the shrine. She was wearing riot gear and had police escort. This angered Sindujan. He joined a mob of protestors who physically blocked Fathima on her way up the hill, forcing her to abandon the trip and return home.

The day became a flashpoint in the post-judgement life of Sabarimala pilgrims, who subsequently blocked about two dozen women who have tried to enter the shrine.

""My eyes welled up, I have seen this woman as part of a 'Kiss of love' protest (a popular protest against moral policing held in Kerala in 2014),"" Sindujan said. ""Are these the kind of women who should visit Sabarimala? They are playing with the light of our life.""

Sindujan was, in fact, articulating a burden that has fallen upon every Sabarimala pilgrim. The annual pilgrimage to Sabarimala is already an arduous affair. Pilgrims renounce material comfort, abstain from sex and alcohol and trek miles through the forest carrying a bulky bag of offerings to the deity.

Given the political polarization, one more factor was now added to the mix: a visit to this pilgrim site now has also become a political statement of sorts for many. Sabarimala pilgrims are now part of a loyal group that loathe those that support women's access to the shrine. Sindujan, 30, sees them as sinners, and is worried about the sanctity of his beloved temple if women are allowed to enter.

He has been dogged in his persistence, having visited the shrine for the 23rd time this year, in the face of hardship. Sindujan lost his right hand in an industrial accident and ekes out a living by selling lottery tickets. Many relish the challenges of these penances, some see it as necessary to attain salvation, and others see it as an opportunity to be seen as a good person.

The pilgrim's guide

In Bunyan's book, the pilgrim is assisted by several colourful characters -- Evangelist, Faithful, Goodwill, Gatekeeper, Interpreter and so on -- who provide the moral boost and support for him to finish the spiritual journey and achieve salvation.

The Sabarimala pilgrim is also not alone in his fight.

Midway through the trek to the hilltop in October, two activists of Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party, stand as guides for pilgrims. They were ferried by the party, like thousands of others, to block women, they say. As soon as Fathima tried to enter, they said, they inspired the mob to chant ""Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa"", a devotional chant that now acts as a dog whistle for protesters, and brings on the righteous anger that animates them to break the law.

The first of the two, who requested not to be named, says his wife just gave birth to a baby boy, and is still in hospital. But he does not want to go home anytime soon. He is enamoured by the sort of hero's welcome his Facebook selfies from the hill are generating.

""My village folks have asked me to tell them in advance when I'm returning so that they can give me a proper reception,"" he said. ""If only we can drag this until the election.""

His zeal, mirroring that of an evangelist, highlights how the Bharatiya Janata Party has made Sabarimala the chosen battleground in the only state, apart from smaller north-eastern ones, in which it does not have an elected member of Parliament.

Beyond the hill, several others are also jostling to be seen as supporting the pilgrims; the most faithful would be the leaders of the Congress, Kerala's main opposition party, who have sworn to be faithful to the pilgrims, despite the party president Rahul Gandhi explicitly telling reporters he favours the entry of women.

The pilgrim's crusade is also supported by the Nair Service Society, the organization of upper caste Nairs in Kerala. But the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, the other major caste organization, belonging to the lower caste Ezhava community, has a blow-hot-blow-cold approach to the protests.

Incidentally, both organizations have their roots in ending caste-based oppression by higher castes in the name of religion.

Then there are the gatekeepers, the head priest Kandararu Mohanaru and the members of the Pandalam royal family who are associated with the temple's rituals and command respect from devotees, who have threatened to shut down the temple if women were allowed entry.

The interpreters, such as right-wing activist and motivational speaker Rahul Easwar and his wife Deepa Rahul Easwar (Easwar is also related to the head priest), are perhaps the most visible faces of the crusade

In debate after debate, from local TV channels to national news studios, they help explain how allowing women is against Lord Ayyappa's will. But their detractors charge them with sophistry and speaking without a deep understanding of the land or the religion. Appearing in a quiz show on Sunday, Deepa, for instance, was asked which taluka Sabarimala falls in. She didn't know.

Met by atheist

A leader from Idukki district of Kerala's ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) is busy making arrangements to ferry hundreds of women to a neighbouring district on 1 January.

They will be joining about one million other women to build a human wall in a show of strength ""against the ongoing attempts to reverse Kerala to the dark ages"", as chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan puts it.

As the Sabarimala pilgrim walked through the forest valley after the apex court judgement, he encountered his biggest nemesis in Vijayan.

The Communist -- who was, ironically, until recently criticized within the Left for alleged right-leaning tendencies -- has been trying to convince pilgrims to give up the crusade and return the hill to peace. The pilgrims, of course, refused. The pilgrim finds strength in quoting the scripture, even as Vijayan holds rallies across the state peppering his speeches with the history of Kerala's progressive religious and caste movements, which he terms ""renaissance history"".

He also persecuted the faces of the crusade, local BJP leaders, and arrested them one by one.

The pilgrims are also ridiculed in the town by Left historians, speakers, writers and even seers. For instance, Swami Sandeepananda Giri, a Left activist-turned-popular spiritual guru, questions some of the basic concepts on which the debate is founded, such as that the deity ""Ayyappa"" is a bachelor. In his speeches and television appearances, he cites Hindu scriptures to state that the bachelor deity Ayyappa is a later creation, who is believed to have merged with the ""Dharma Sastha"" deity form who is said to have two wives.

According to P.K. Sajeev, founder of the Aikya Mala Araya Maha Sabha, Ayyappan is a tribal god who had nothing against women visiting, but was a hapless victim of Brahminisation of the temple and its rituals, which subsequently ousted not only menstrual age women but also the tribal community from the shrine.

Despite this, the Sabarimala pilgrims continue their fight in the apex court, expecting the court to admit a plea for review of the judgement on 14 January.

The Sabarimala story is also a tale of the gradual unravelling of the Indian secular state, experts say.

The turbulent situation in Sabarimala can be viewed as an example of a conflict between religious freedom and the regulatory powers of the state, according to Sumantra Bose, a professor of international and comparative politics at the London School of Economics (LSE).

""India is a secular state with no state religion. Of course, the actual reality, the political reality has shifted over time... (but this secular state concept) is not based on a measured and deliberate separation between the church and state, sort of a bedrock of the Western version of the secularism,"" Bose said while giving a talk on his new book, Secular States, Religious Politics: India, Turkey, and the Future of Secularism at LSE on 23 October.

The Indian state, he said, is self-invested with vast powers over religion and religious matters. ""So the Indian Constitution assures religious liberty for all, freedom of faith profession, practise, propagation, but always subject to public order, morality and health. And of course the ultimate interpreter of what constitutes or does not constitute public order, morality and health is the state and those at the helm at the state.""

What follows from this is the state constantly and inevitably intervening in the religious domain, giving rise to allegations of interference.

In the process, the state should also not give preferential treatment or discriminate against various religious sects, which is much easier said than done, said Bose.

In 2019, such debates are bound to grow louder, as governments try to piggyback to power on the rise of majoritarian forces. With general elections due by May 2019, the central government is already facing pressure from within to commit to building a Ram temple in Ayodhya in place of the Babri mosque, despite the matter being before the apex court.

Both religion and constitution are made out of rules and customs, and come to life upon their faithful observance. Both are built on a ground of social mores. How does one resolve a conflict where the two battle for an upper hand over what constitutes right and wrong?"

New Delhi: There is no Indian conglomerate that can come within touching distance of Reliance today in terms of net worth, even though brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani have split the business into their own diversified groups. And for that wealth, they have to thank the vision and risk-taking ability of their father, the late Dhirubhai Ambani.

Rising from a clerk in a British company in Aden, to the 'prince of polyester', to the uncrowned king of India Inc. and a Padma Vibhushan awardee, the senior Ambani lived a fascinating life, which was even adapted into the Bollywood blockbuster Guru by legendary director Mani Ratnam.

On his 86 birth anniversary, ThePrint looks back at the story of how Ambani surpassed every established name in the business community in a matter of three decades.

Dhirajlal Hirachand Ambani was born on 28 December 1932 in Junagarh, modern-day Gujarat, to school teachers Jamnaben (known to be a thrifty homemaker) and Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani. A fierce independence activist in school, he was inspired by Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.

Ambani wanted to go to college, but owing to his father's ill-health, he was compelled to get a job in Aden, a former British colony on the Arabian peninsula, now the temporary capital of Yemen. He worked as a clerk at A. Besse & Co, and learnt the ropes of business.

He came back to India in 1954 after five years in Aden, as a promoter for A. Besse & Co.'s shell refinery. Having married Kokilaben, he then decided to try his hand at trading. Although Ambani was tempted to set up shop in London, he finally decided to establish a business in what was then Bombay.

With the little money he had, Ambani decided to venture into spice trading, and soon, the orders began flowing in from Yemen. He then expanded the trade to include other commodities, including manure-mixed topsoil for a sheikh's lawn.

""We made big money from that order, real big money,"" Ámbani was quoted as saying.

After Partition, the textile industry in India had come to a standstill, as the major cotton producing regions were in Pakistan while the cotton mills were in Bombay.

While Ambani was exporting spices to Yemen, he gained an export replenishment licence, which he then used to import polyester yarn into India due to the dearth of fabric in India. At first, he sold the imported polyester yarn in Bombay markets at premiums ranging up to 300 per cent. He then realised that there was more profit in selling value-added nylon textiles.

Ambani decided to set up a fabrics business with his second cousin, Champaklal Damani, who lived in Turkey and imported the polyester yarn to Yemen. This is how Reliance was born in 1966. However, they soon parted ways due to ideological differences.

Reliance started producing nylon fabrics under the 'Vimal' name, which soon became one of the highest-selling fabric brands in the country. Reliance also received the award of excellence from the World Bank.

By 1977, when Reliance went public, it had more than 58,000 investors. Ambani expanded the business by stepping into telecommunications, information technology, energy, power, retail, textiles, infrastructure services, capital markets and logistics.

But it wasn't just his knack for business that brought Ambani -- he had charm and people skills too. It was said that Ambani always knew whom to contact to get the deed done, and had even explained his business ideas to then-PM Indira Gandhi at a party once. He was also known to ""curry favours"" from influential politicians.

Ambani's rise to success was as controversial as it was fascinating. He received his fair share of criticism for building an empire based on favours from the higher-ups in government.

There was also a polyester turf war between Ambani and Nusli Wadia, the head of Bombay Dyeing Company in the 1980s. In an interview with Firstpost, Wadia stated that Ambani's ""manipulation of policies"" was the reason for his company's defeat.

Sometimes, the voices that have tried to accuse Ambani of extracting political favours have been hushed in India. An example of this was the biography titled The Polyester Prince by author Hamish McDonald, which did not show the Ambanis in a favourable light. It was banned in 1998 under Section 297A of the Indian Penal Code, calling it a threat to civil order.

Ambani suffered a stroke in 1986, after which he began handing over the day-to-day control of Reliance to sons Mukesh and Anil.

He had another major stroke in 2002, which led to his demise on 24 June. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government released a postage stamp in his honour on what would have been his 70 birthday, 28 December 2002.

In 2016, the Narendra Modi-led NDA government conferred the Padma Vibhushan on him posthumously.

However, as time goes on, Ambani's legacy continues to carry on in the way Reliance Industries continues to grow. Even the glitz of granddaughter Isha Ambani's recent wedding owes itself to the empire that the school teachers' son from Junagarh created."

On a typically cold summer evening in Liverpool, it's business as usual for Tatenda Taibu. He's at St Mary's college to pick his 13-year-old son, Tatenda Junior, from school. The usual daily elaborative review talk starts, and from Math, English, Arts, Music, it veers towards sports.

Tatenda Jr: Dad, the coaches showed us (Class 7 students) a video where players were hitting big sixes. There was this big guy, tall left-hander...

Taibu: Chris Gayle?

Tatenda Jr: Yes, yes, yes. How do you know?

Taibu: I thought it was him because he hits the ball a long way

Tatenda Jr: You know him?

Taibu: Yes, I do

Tatenda Jr: How?

Taibu: I played against him, and with him, and was communicating with him 3 weeks ago.

Tatenda Jr: No dad, you are lying

Taibu: Look here on my phone (shows videos of him playing cricket with Gayle).

Tatenda Jr (looks in disbelief)

Taibu: Let's get home and I will show you more.

A simple conversation between father and son would serve as the straw that would break the camel's back and bring Tatenda Taibu back to cricket after six years.

""You know with my family, even when I was playing and my boy was old enough (3-6 years) to understand a little bit between, I never took cricket back home,"" Taibu tells Firstpost. ""Cricket remained at the ground and when I went home, I wanted my boy to know me as a dad and not as a superstar.""

Unaware that his father played for the Zimbabwe national team and against some big stars, Tatenda Jr stared at the phone in disbelief as his father showed him more videos of his top innings after reaching home.

""Cricket remained at the ground and when I went home, I wanted my boy to know me as a dad and not as a superstar."" Image courtesy Tatenda Taibu

""He (Tatenda Jr) sort of knew that dad is famous but he didn't know what dad was famous for. I thought, let me tell him a bit more about what I achieved in cricket because I never really talked about my achievements at home. So then he said, 'I would really love to see you play, I would really love to see how you played'. So I said I will give my boy a chance to watch me.""

The decision was made on an impulse, in consultation with his wife, Loveness Taibu, who has always been a supportive force. The doting father decided to return to professional cricket so that his son could watch him play.

When Taibu decides to take up something, he gives it his 100 percent. Just three months after having that conversation with his son, Taibu was back on the field, playing professional cricket in the Sri Lankan domestic arena. Signed as an overseas player for Baduraliya CC, his first four innings scores read: 13, 57, 39 and 13.

Ahead of the first match, it felt like someone had hit the reboot button.

""I felt nerves. I felt like I was playing on debut again. But as soon as I stepped onto the field, I felt it as a familiar place and the nerves quickly went away.

And then he animatedly singles out the 57-run innings and says with a tinge of regret, ""I should have scored a hundred (in the second innings of the first match). When I got to 50, there was still enough time. I definitely should have got a hundred, I was feeling very good. I kept as well, took 2 catches and haven't conceded any byes so far, so it's been good.""

So why play domestic cricket in Sri Lanka and not Zimbabwe?

Having visited the country in the past, he knew that the Sri Lankan first-class cricket was ""quite competitive."" And secondly, he needed to speak to someone who understood him well. So he got in touch with his good friend Roshan Abeysinghe, a long time broadcaster and commentator, and after a heart-to-heart discussion where some tough questions were asked, Abheysinghe put Taibu's name forward in the Sri Lankan domestic arena.

""I knew that I will walk into the domestic arena of Zimbabwe and score runs. I wanted something challenging, I like a challenge and I like to overcome a challenge,"" Taibu explains. ""I never played first-class cricket in Sri Lanka, I don't know most of the bowlers. I have only faced one or two that I have played with before. So I am facing new bowlers, new conditions, new team, and new environment. Everything is new. So for me, it's a proper test of my ability. If I do well in that, I will have the satisfaction that I can still play the game.""

The preparations had accelerated ahead of the Sri Lankan domestic season. The family had joined in to help. His wife and son would feed the balls in the bowling machine provided by his club where he played some cricket and coached in Liverpool.

Bereft of a team environment and cricket set-up, Loveness would help her husband schedule practices and instill discipline along with keeping a constant vigil to avoid complacency.

At 35, it is a given that the first question Taibu would have faced was about his fitness. That, however, is the least of his concerns.

""Gladly, I have always kept fit and I knew that just hitting a few balls in the nets over the bowling machine will get me back into form,"" Taibu asserts.

""Look, when I stopped playing cricket, I never really stopped training, even physical training. When I made the decision (to come back to competitive cricket), my schedule included running 7 kms on the beach, twice a week and then the other days in between, I would be doing sprints on the beach. I did all my fitness on the sand. So in terms of fitness, it's probably the easiest thing for me. I would not be lying if I said I am probably one of the fittest cricketers in the world. Without a doubt,"" he adds.

Tatenda Taibu became the youngest captain in the history of Test cricket when he led Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka at Harare in 2004. Reuters

Taibu is no stranger to comebacks. And this was yet another twist in his life that has endured an Afridiesque curve. The diminutive 18-year-old Shona from Harare arrived on the cricketing scene as a promising wicket-keeper-batsman touted to be a potential successor of Andy Flower. He became Zimbabwe's first black captain, the youngest in the world, at 20. He then resigned from the captaincy, quit cricket, moved to South Africa, returned, and then again announced retirement at the age of 29 in 2012 finishing as the fourth-highest run-getter in ODIs for Zimbabwe, affecting the second-most dismissals in a decade-long international career. His decision to quit the second time came as a surprise as just hours ago, he had been named in Zimbabwe's provisional squad for 2012 World T20. However, at the time, his heart was somewhere else - towards the Lord.

""I had felt a calling in my heart to do some church work and I was on a spiritual journey at that time,"" Taibu explains. ""I needed to find some peace in my heart and that was the calling that I believe I had. And my character is such that, when I am looking at a certain direction, I can't look at other things around. I just look at where I want to go and hit and then I focus on that. So when I was focusing all my energy on my spiritual journey, even cricket became a distraction. I was not giving cricket my 100 percent attention which I was giving to my soul-searching. So, cricket had to go.""

Taibu set off to do work for churches. He was a trustee at a church where he would take care of the overall operations - look after the assets of the church, make sure the building is intact, benches, piano, and musical instruments are working. He took care of electricity and water bills and distributed money, food, and transport to the poor besides being part of the group that was praying for sick people.

Disconnected totally from cricket, it was a life changing experience. ""I found that to be fulfilling in my heart. It gives you constant satisfaction to the day. I cannot describe it. Even though I got no cent the satisfaction it brings even when I talk about it now, cannot be measured with money.""

All through this, he was living on the money generated from renting posh houses purchased during his playing days. He was doing some business with his Indian friends and was a shareholder in a gold mining company. But with the political and economic condition deteriorating in the country Taibu shifted base to the United Kingdom in 2015 where he enrolled his children in St Mary's college to give them the best education possible. Being on a tier 4 visa (the visa is issued to a parent in support of a child who is doing their education in UK), the 35-year-old is not allowed to work in the UK and he still lives mainly off the money from the rented houses.

""I wasn't foolish with money when I was earning a lot as a player,"" he says. ""I had bought several nice houses and rented them out. They cost about 1200-1400 USD monthly. That's a lot of money. That's quite comfortable and I have been living like that since I left cricket.

It was after four years, he returned to the field, playing for Liverpool and District team Hightown St Mary's where he coached the kids too and also opened an academy.

And then again, life took another turn. Taibu was back with Zimbabwe Cricket as convener of selectors and development officer. It was a year-long on-off conversation with Zimbabwe Cricket chairman Tavengwa Mukuhlani which started when he bumped into him at a bank in Bulawayo, that culminated into the former captain taking up the position after a lot of convincing.

He didn't take the proposal seriously at first given his tumultuous relationship with the board over the years. But after some intense one-to-one conversations with Mukhulani, he decided to take up the job.

After almost two years in charge, he was sacked earlier this year, along with coach Heath Streak and captain Graeme Cremer after Zimbabwe failed to qualify for the 2019 World Cup. The lack of (or no) communication and explanation from Mukhulani after sacking left Taibu unhappy.

At 35, Taibu has seen it all and still going strong. However, he doesn't want to go overboard. A national return is still far away from sight. He wants to take a realistic route rather than an idealistic one.

""I haven't thought that far. Because to start thinking about international, I have to be comfortable in first-class and I have to have the confidence that my body is still in shape, I have to have the confidence that I will score hundreds, I have to have the confidence that I will take not only good catches but great catches. So it's a little bit too early to be thinking about that.""

It will also mean moving back to Zimbabwe along with making sure that his other projects, which are under the supervision of his agent and wife in his absence, aren't affected. He might take a decision on the next step at the end of the Sri Lankan season, around March-April. Then spend the summer with family before getting back onto the field for club cricket.

All through the chat, the excitement in Taibu's voice is palpable. Just like his inexhaustible energy, the nostalgia factor too hasn't gone away. Every time he has a conversation with ones who know the game, memories come back.

""They remind me that I used to hold the record for the youngest captain in the history of Test cricket. I am reminded about that all the time. Every time I am in India, I am reminded about playing in Kolkata (for Kolkata Knight Riders). Only two days ago, someone sent me a message saying 'I didn't know you were the player of the tournament in the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand.' We played against SSC here whose coach is Thilina Kandambi, he asked me, do you remember you once bowled me out in a one-day game? So yes, when people send messages, I have to remember those things. It brings back memories.""

""I think, I have passed that stage where I think for myself now. All the decisions I make now it's either for my wife or kids, it's never me anymore.""

So, just like the Chanderpauls, is there a chance we could see the Taibus playing together? Well, Taibu senior has no plans of getting his son into professional cricket.

""He doesn't have the basic talent for a cricketer. He loves the sport but doesn't want to practice. I have only done practice with my boy twice. He doesn't want it. He would play for school or club, score two runs, not take a wicket and come back and say, I enjoyed the cricket today. From a young age, I was taught to enjoy cricket and I enjoyed my cricket when we won. But with him, they can lose, he won't have contributed but still, he will come back and say, 'Dad, I enjoyed my cricket today' (laughs). So I am happy with him like that.""

It might seem far-fetched but if it does happen, what would it feel like donning that Zimbabwe jersey again?

""The feeling will not be for me but my boy. I think I have passed that stage where I think for myself. All the decisions I make now it's either for my wife or kids, it's never me anymore.""

If it does happen, it will be a fairytale even Tatenda Jr has to believe.

'Employers on most occasions find it difficult to find a match between the two,' Adi Godrej tells Viveat Susan Pinto and Niraj Bhatt.

As we enter the sprawling Godrej facilities in the Mumbai suburb of Vikhroli to meet group Chairman Adi Godrej for our lunch meeting, the first thing we notice are the changes taking place.

A landscaped garden, the under-construction buildings and the new headquarters all suggest that it is no longer a conservative, 121-year-old group.

Tall structures have replaced the understated three-storeyed buildings, announcing the group's real estate ambitions.

<>Godrej One, the new 11-storeyed headquarters, is the first building under The Trees, a mixed-use development master plan, which will have commercial, retail, residential, a five-star hotel and cultural spaces.

The other change is Adi Godrej handing over the reins at key operating companies last year to his children, while he continues as chairman at the group level and at Godrej Industries.

Known for his disciplined lifestyle, Godrej, an early riser, walks to stay fit and makes it to office at quarter past eight every morning.

He's also on time for our lunch, slated at 1 pm at the directors' dining hall on the fifth floor of Godrej One.

The Godrej family, whose net worth, according to the Forbes 2018 ranking, is $14 billion, derives a significant portion of its wealth from owning land in Vikhroli.

Godrej Properties, the group's real estate arm, says Godrej, holds enormous promise as the demand for quality housing grows in Mumbai and other cities.

The Godrej group is the largest real estate owner of Mumbai with 4,000 acres, and The Trees project is part of the group's monetisation exercise.

Other listed group companies include Godrej Consumer, Godrej Industries and Godrej Agrovet.

The directors' dining hall overlooks the Eastern Express Highway and the verdant mangroves beyond, which the family trusts protects.

An imposing Anjolie Ela Menon adds colour to the otherwise white room.

As we are served Mexican bean soup and corn cheese toast, the 76-year-old Godrej is quick to point out that he is not an art connoisseur and the painting was bought by his wife Parmeshwar who passed away two years ago.

In a sense, she was the perfect foil to Godrej, say industry peers, outgoing to his largely reserved nature, a fashionista to his more formal dressing style, a woman who led her life to the fullest.

Unlike his billionaire peers, Godrej doesn't find it necessary to own a corporate jet, preferring to fly commercial or occasionally chartering aircraft.

He says about his wife: ""She added her own dimension. She had a lot of friends; was social. She also helped in the business, with advertising (for brands such as Cinthol) as well as in new product formulations.""

Parmeshwar's work on improving AIDS awareness in the country along with actor Richard Gere as part of the 'Heroes Project' a decade-and-a-half ago is well-known.

Godrej himself remains passionate about healthcare, education and environmental sustainability.

He recently stepped down as chairman of the board of Indian School of Business, but continues to be on the board.

He has championed the cause of effective skilling and training of people at various fora.

""I don't think there is a dearth of jobs in India. What exists instead is a clear gap between skilled people and the work at hand. Employers on most occasions find it difficult to find a match between the two, which is why it is important to focus on skill training,"" he says.

Joint ventures stitched up by the Godrej Group across categories from appliances to personal care, wheat flour to packaged food, following the 1991 liberalisation of the Indian economy, were rolled out quickly, but didn't last long.

Godrej has no regrets about them saying, ""They were not useful beyond a point.""

In the last 10 years, the group has opted to take the inorganic route to growth, buying companies across Asia, Africa and South America.

Godrej says the group's focus remains mainly on these markets and that it is open to divestment opportunities elsewhere, such as the one it undertook recently in the UK, where the group exited Keyline Brands, its first overseas acquisition, done in 2005.

Godrej does not have any diversification plans on the table, but will ""enter adjacencies"".

The macro headwinds that India is facing at present do not bother him.

India, he says, will be the fastest growing major economy in the world despite all the challenges.

His advice to the next generation is to ""look forward to Mondays"".

Godrej, who holds a bachelor's degree in engineering and an MBA both from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is passionate about management.

""My father was into technology while I was more into management,"" he says.

Godrej, say corporate governance experts, has always relied on a healthy board comprising qualified practitioners and was amongst the first to introduce independent directors on the boards of group companies in India.

""The way to avoid a conflict is to take a thought or idea to the board early on the decision-making process,"" he says over the main course of ratatouille lasagna.

The Godrej model of ownership has also been keenly tracked by observers that involves inducting qualified family members into the business, encouraging them to contribute meaningfully to the organisation in their chosen domain and working closely with professional managers in the group.

Godrej's three children -- Tanya, Nisaba and Pirojsha -- have all been through this process, he says, who are now heading group companies after working their way up.

While Tanya is the chairperson of Godrej Nature's Basket, Nisaba heads the Godrej Consumer board, while Pirojsha is chairman, Godrej Properties.

Though Godrej has given his children the freedom to run their companies, he still oversees operations as group chairman.

""They are qualified and capable of running their businesses well. While we keep ownership and management separate, if anybody from the family wants to join the business, our point is that you have to be well qualified to do so,"" he says as the table is cleared for dessert, which includes cut fruits.

The Godrej Group has also been at the forefront when hiring women, giving them flexi-hours and daycare facilities, and has been one of the early employers of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community in its offices across the globe.

""We were early believers in diversity and felt that we should have a strong representation of women in our organisation. Globally, 40 per cent of our employees are women. In certain geographies such as Africa, Indonesia and the north east of India, the percentage of women employees is even higher,"" Godrej says.

It had also set up a committee for sexual harassment complaints years ago.

""We gave women the option to complain if they faced a problem,"" he says.

His love for travel has taken Godrej to 95 countries across the seven continents.

A supporter of the World Wildlife Fund in India, Godrej prefers nature and likes to get away to the mountains.

He loves reading autobiographies and biographies and has been greatly influenced by leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela and Margaret Thatcher.

""Right now I am reading Ramchandra Guha's Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World. This is possibly the thickest book I've ever read,"" he says on his favourite pastime.

""I am fascinated by the fact that Socrates was Plato's tutor, Plato was Aristotle's tutor and Aristotle was Alexander's tutor. I have read about them all and the impact they've had,"" he says as we finish our coffee."

Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja's Facebook page 'I am for Alleppey' is helping rehabilitate those affected in the flood-battered state.

Bengaluru: In August, when severe floods ravaged Kerala, killing 433 people and causing damage worth Rs 40,000 crore, the relief and rescue efforts, particularly by the local fishermen, were hailed by everyone.

One of the earliest, and biggest, rescue missions -- ""Operation Kuttanad"" -- was led by state Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja Mylavarapu. The alertness and quick response shown by this officer and his team in evacuating and moving people to safer zones saved the lives of nearly 2 lakh people in the Kuttanad area of Alleppey, which was the worst affected by the flood.

After the rescue operations, the young, dynamic IAS officer shifted focus to rehabilitation and launched ""I am for Alleppey (IAFA)"" on Facebook, the first crowd funding-based social media initiative that has been successfully helping locals rebuild their lives.

The campaign team is close to building nearly 500 homes and provided for infrastructure for schools and hospitals, largely in the Kuttanad area. Businessmen and celebrities have come forward to help and donate, giving people cattle and ensuring safe potable water.

On 24 December, the initiative marked 100 days of its launch.

During the rescue operations, Teja realised how crucial social media could be when several images and messages were circulated on it. He decided to use Facebook to seek help.

""During a crisis, the focus of the people and government is usually concentrated on rescue. But after one tides over the crisis, the focus is lessened during rehabilitation (sic). That is when I realised that it is important to concentrate on rehabilitation,"" Teja told The Print, explaining the rationale behind the initiative.

""I thought we would bring some campaign which gives some momentum for the work we have done. That is why I launched 'I am for Alleppey'. This initiative works in tandem with government programmes and adds value to efforts put (in) by all of us,"" he said.

When the page was shared among Teja's friends the day it was launched -- on 14 September -- within six hours, a woman from Kerala, who was living in Andhra Pradesh, agreed to adopt a primary health centre in Kuttanad. ""This was our first success story,"" said Teja.

Teja's Facebook page has built up an impressive following since then, and has been liked by more than 96,000 people.

""I am for Alleppey"" has been conducting several rehabilitation programmes:

Officials found during a survey that despite extensive rescue operations, nearly 500 animals were lost. This was a severe setback for the 133 families in Kuttanad who were completely dependent on livestock for their livelihood. This initiative helped generate interest among those who wanted to donate a cow to the dairy farm owners.

The process is simple. IAFA volunteers identify healthy cows in the district or nearby areas. When a donor approaches them through the Facebook page, a price lower than the market rate is quoted. Once the price is fixed, the cow is handed over to a beneficiary identified by the IAFA team. This way the dairy farmer benefits directly.

""We ensure that it is a healthy and insured cow, preferably one that is pregnant so that it would not stress the farmer,"" says Teja. ""Every cow is screened and insured for a year. There are already 120 people who are ready to donate cows and we have already donated 66 cows.""

He emphasises that the IAFA ensures it sources the cattle from Kerala and not from neighbouring states such as Tamil Nadu, so that that revenue generated remains within the state.

Kuttanad faced two successive floods and schoolchildren lost out on three months of their academic year. Attendance fell and classrooms were empty. The IAFA provided notebooks, schoolbags and water bottles for children as incentives to go to school.

The move worked. By 14 November, three months after the floods, 40,000 students were back in government schools in Alleppey.

In Kuttanad, the anganwadis also grappled with another problem after the deluge -- that of drinking water contamination. The IAFA came to the rescue, fitting water filters free of cost to ensure clean drinking water.

The team from the blockbustre film Baahubali was the first to promise to build five houses in the area. Later, many others stepped in. By the end of January, the team expects 500 houses to be built.

Telugu cine star Allu Arjun adopted 10 anganwadis while organisations such as the Ramakrishna Mission, Save the Children and Andhra Pradesh Unaided Schools Management Association provided for schoolbooks and other basic facilities. Of 99 anganwadis, 50 have been adopted till date.

Stressing on dignity for widows, the IAFA refers to their families as women-headed ones. It believes these families require extra help as it is even more difficult for them to rebuild their lives. About 6,000 such families have befitted and received kitchen and other household articles, campaign workers say.

The IAFA has organised medical camps and provided two months' free medicine, food and protein supplements to benefit nearly 4,000 elderly people in the area.

Several specially-abled persons lost equipment such as hearing or visual aids during the floods. IAFA volunteers visited the houses of such people and gathered a list of their requirements. After registering with the local primary health centres, nearly 6,000 people were provided equipment free of cost.

The worst-hit roads in Alleppey were mapped and identified to assess the extent of damage to trees. After a detailed study, 400 saplings were planted to help rebuild the green cover.

The IAFA provided free nets to the local fishermen.

Rameshan, a cattle farmer from lower Kuttanad's Kainakari panchayat, lost most of his livestock. He is a beneficiary of the ""Donate a Cow"" campaign.

""I am happy that I can sell this milk and feed my family. I don't understand what this internet and Facebook is. But I know that through Krishna Teja sir, I have been given a cow sponsored by a Good Samaritan. We are very thankful,"" he said.

Shiny V, headmistress of the KK Kumarapilla Smaraka Government High school in Karumady, Alleppey district, recalls how badly affected her school was.

""We wanted to encourage children to come back to school and instill reading habit in them. There was no space to keep such books and (I) requested for almirahs. I met sub-collector Krishna Teja sir who at that time asked me the condition of our computer lab.... it was in bad shape..."" says Shiny V.

""In less than an hour, he (Teja) said he will provide us funds worth Rs 2 lakh. With that money we bought four laptops, 11 chairs, two printers and furnishings for the computer room. We are indebted to our sponsor AP Unaided Schools Association who provided us infrastructure for our school,"" she adds.

C.S. Balachandra, founder of Abhaya Foundation, is among the organisations helping with construction of houses.

""Instead of distributing only relief material, we wanted to involve ourselves in a more constructive way. After consulting with three sets of engineering experts from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala, we found a 'flood-resistant construction module' which costs close to Rs 6 lakh per unit. On an experimental basis, we are building five homes in the Thirumala and Nehru Trophy wards,"" he said.

The efforts by Teja and his team have received positive feedback on social media, and have been appreciated by both the state and the central governments.

""I am for Allepey is an endeavour in addition to the rehabilitation programmes by the Kerala government. We are only additionally facilitating to help maximum impact in our small way... I only hope that in times of need or calamity, people get together and help one another, during and after,"" says the IAS officer."

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

'Understanding the masks of humans, through the face of an actor', reads the subhead of the book. Curious, we decided to have a chat with her, and here is what she said...

A book out of the blue...

I was speaking at this youth congregation organised by the US Consulate and an NGO, and while I was prepping for the speech I was to give, I came across college students there, participants of workshops and other activities that dealt with issues like what challenges to expect when you are in your twenties and all that. There was a lot of talk about issues like bullying.

That gave you this idea of coming out with a handbook of sorts?

The event was held over two days, and Sriram of this foundation had also organised for five counsellors to be present at the event; the students could walk into the room of any one of them at any point and have a session, free of cost. There was also a lot of talk about mental health and how to remove the taboo around speaking up about it. I found a good idea when I saw all this. I started thinking how do I put forward my perspective, contribute as an actor? I wanted to help them.

But why a book?

Social media is all over the place, and everyone is on it. Everything looks good on Instagram. I wanted to tell them internet never posts anyone's failures, and here is mine, in black-and-white. And because it was a cause, I didn't charge, and designed the book like a handout.

The book talks about the challenges of a teenager. What were your growing-up struggles?

I think about them as challenges only in retrospect. Words like 'challenges' had no place back then, and I didn't even realise that I was struggling. And apart from the bullying, it was majorly the identity crisis, I guess. People from my generation, especially, are products of a inter-caste or cross-religion marriages -- the Two States kind of marriages. It wasn't popular back then, you know. But we lived through that. My mom is a Kannadiga, bought up in Chennai, my dad is Tamil, but neither born or brought up in Chennai. I was born in Bangalore, brought up here in Chennai... So, after school, till which time we were pretty unaware of many things, stepping out into the real world made questions like 'Who am I?' and 'What are my roots?' very real.

What do you mean by 'bullying'?

I guess everyone goes through it in different forms, but I was made fun of for not knowing English songs back then, for oiling my hair, things like that. At that age, these things matter a lot.

Do you think if you had grown up in some other place it'd have been better?

I don't think so. Even Priyanka Chopra recently spoke about being bullied and how she used to eat lunch in the bathroom. So, bullying is a global issue. The point I am trying to put forth in the book is that no matter who you are or where you are, these are the problems everyone faces and has to learn to deal with. You are not alone, you know.

In India, especially, it's always about the lack of support for the victims...

Yes, specifically when it comes to sexual harassment, we've seen this happen all the time. Everything relies on proof. You need to prove it happened to you. All over the internet are victims, who are asking things like, 'did you expect us to walk around with a CCTV all the time?' So sexual harassment is a completely different case as far as helping out the victims is concerned. When it comes to bullying, there's some good help out there. Of course, there's still this taboo around it. Adults my age and older to me, still think they should not go to a doctor or counsellor or psychiatrist for treating mental trauma or disorders. Why not treat it like any other physical wound? You need to go to a doctor to help you heal. In fact, that's the reason why I have made the book available for an online read on my website -- www.poojadevariya.com -- it may help someone seek out help.

So, did your becoming an actor have anything to do with what you went through?

Like I have said in the book, I had no idea that all that I was going through was building up to it. I was always inclined towards the arts. I'd be the first to sign up for dance, theatre, painting, etc, even in school. And I was always like, I'll figure something out for myself.

The recent days have seen a lot of talk about sexually predatory behaviour in the cinema industry...

Well, I am not going to say this is specific to my industry -- it's so easy to say it all happens only in the entertainment industry. Our private lives are also public all the time, and so such instances are more evident in our industry. But I believe it is prevalent in all industries. I've heard my friends talk about it. And yes, I've had those uncomfortable moments within the industry, too. But that said, I have had my challenges with many creepy men just about everywhere -- on the streets, in the bus, a new call driver, cabbie... It's difficult to trust anyone these days."

We learnt about the difference between a meteor, comet and asteroid.

By Ritika Jain

Recently, I had the privilege to attend a sort of 'beginner's guide to astronomy' workshop in Sariska. It also happened to be the weekend the Geminid meteor shower was visible to the naked eye and it peaked on December 14th. An annual event, it was first recorded roughly 200 years ago. What we witnessed was only possible because of the cooperation of the resort we stayed at.

Stargazing requires you to have a completely dark sky, with no light pollution that a city usually has. Kudos to the staff of Jungle Camp Sariska, who switched off all the lights so that the astro-tourists could adapt their eyes to the dark. A lot of attendees were families with children, and the programme was structured to be simple enough for kids to enjoy as well. It started with a basic introduction to common terms like constellations and asterisms, and went on to teach about mapping stars like the Polaris to find the correct direction in the night. We even got to touch part of a meteorite, probably the oldest thing any of us had ever touched.

Later, we all stayed up (albeit shivering) till 2 am in what was a practical science class -- only it was the most fun class ever! What we witnessed was like celestial fireworks -- almost two shooting stars per minute. They seem to diverge from a single spot in the sky, called the radiant, located in the constellation Gemini but can be seen all across the sky. We used torches covered with red paper because apparently that's how you scatter the least amount of light. We learnt about the difference between a meteor, comet and asteroid. And about the zenith and nadir, altitude and aziruth. We saw the surface of the moon and a nebula through a telescope. A bonus was the sighting of the bright green comet 46P in the constellation Orion, also a rare occurrence.

The organising team, Astrowanderers, are a bunch of astronomy enthusiasts with varied backgrounds who've come together to educate people about environment sensitivity, especially the importance of preserving the night sky. By organising these trips and showing people first-hand how amazing the night sky is, they also stimulate in them a sense of responsibility besides creating tourism opportunities in places that have naturally wide horizons and probably want to preserve the environment as it is. This is true for locals of nearby village Murlipura, whose inhabitants are simple farmers. Even television is a rarity here.

According to Abhinav P Dubey, the founding member of Astrowanderers, there is a celestial event every month that they have the opportunity to plan a trip around. They also introduce people to astrophotography and take some group pictures with the heavens as the backdrop. There is music around a bonfire, hiking opportunities and day excursions to the fabled 17th century Bhangarh fort and Mansarovar lake. The area has 93 recorded bird species and the national park is home to a variety of species including antelopes, wild boars, hyenas and even carnivorous leopards and other jungle cats. We saw a lot of peafowl nesting in the mustard fields lining Sariska along with other birds like kingfishers, jungle babblers and magpies. We also had the opportunity to see the antics of the langurs and macaques at the Hanuman temple at Bhangarh. Shiva devotees often visit the Naldeshwar shrine off the highway, and the Pandupol temple inside the reserve is said to date back to the Mahabharata. All in all, it's a perfect culture/nature trip that puts a lot of things in perspective.

Sariska also has other camps like Astroport where amateur astronomers have access to all the necessary equipment required for astronomical research, like telescopes, star charts and cameras as well as an observatory. They host school groups for educational programmes and have a number of interesting themes coming up, including life in a jungle, fossil finds, backyard bugs, etc. Offsite activities include visiting the Bat Point or Crocodile Point at Siliserh Lake, picnic at Mangalsar Dam, cycling in the Aravalis and visiting the Alwar Fort.

EdTerra is a Delhi-based education travel company that offers highly specialised summer camps in Chamba. One can pre-register for a six-day astronomy camp under two age groups -- 12 to 14 and 14 to 16. It also gives budding astronomers a chance to engage in team-building exercises as well as assembling their own telescopes to take home. Well-known in the community, head educator Rishabh Jain is also an ace astrophotographer. His work has been featured in popular magazines and websites like BBC Earth. The camps accommodate a group of 30 kids, with 4-6 kids per tent. There is separate accommodation for girls and boys, and the adult-child ratio while travelling is 1:10. Safety being of paramount importance, each staff member is qualified to administer First Aid.

SPACE is another organisation offering space explorer workshops and a space astronomy club membership in the NCR. These clubs have been running successfully since 2001 in over 250 schools of Delhi. They are also active in other cities of India including Chennai, Ludhiana, Meerut and Surat. They make science simple to understand and spark your imagination through innovative, fun projects that are taught by knowledgeable, friendly people to provide a memorable experience. As a member, students can also participate in national and international competitions and projects organised by SPACE, NASA, ESA and RSA, ISRO, etc."

Soon bill learned that his neighbors abandoned puppy, because he could not afford to pay for treatment at a veterinary clinic. The fire was not able to throw a wounded Jack in the lurch, and took him to his home. After several months of intensive treatment little Jack was strong enough that bill began to take him with him to work at the fire station.

And in December, the grown-up Jack became the official mascot of the fire station Hanahan. Together with his best friend and fellow dog goes to school lessons, which talk about fire safety.

Only a few animals, and people survive with so many burns 2nd and 3rd degree.

However, Jack proved to be strong small. Certainly not the last role was played by the fact that, while there was a process of recovery, the puppy know that he is loved and welcome.

The owners of the puppy are unable to pay for his treatment and threw the dog.

But the firefighter who saved Jack, immediately took him to himself.

Jack became the official mascot of the fire station where bill works.

At the moment the grown-up Jack is trained and will soon become a service dog that determines the fact of arson at the fire scene."

YALAMBOJOCH, Guatemala (Reuters) - Between heavy sobs, Catarina Alonzo explained that when her husband left Guatemala to try to reach the United States, they hoped taking their 8-year-old son would make it easier for the pair to get in. Instead, the boy fell ill and died.

Detained on the U.S. border, Felipe Gomez Alonzo died late on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital a few weeks after setting off with his father, becoming the second Guatemalan child to die this month while in U.S. custody.

The two deaths have led to increased criticism of the Trump administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration, as well as fresh scrutiny of why some migrants from Central America travel with children on the long, dangerous road north.

Speaking at her home in a mountainous region of western Guatemala, Catarina Alonzo said neighbours had told the family that taking a child would provide her husband with a way in.

""Lots of them have gone with children and managed to cross, even if they're held for a month or two. But they always manage to get across easily,"" she told Reuters in an interview.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has yet to give an official cause of death for the boy, prompting Democratic lawmakers to intensify calls for an investigation.

The Department of Homeland Security, which says that Felipe Gomez Alonzo and 7-year-old Jakelin Caal, who died on Dec. 8, were the first children to die in CBP custody in a decade, this week said it would step up medical checks of migrant children to try to prevent any more deaths.

Alonzo, an indigenous Maya and native speaker of Chuj, has little Spanish and communicated through a translator. Wearing a sweatshirt and a purple dress, she spoke outside her hut in Yalambojoch, a village of about 1,000 people near the Mexican border.

She related how her son and his father, Agustin, an agricultural worker, had left in early December to find work in the United States to pay off debts. The two also hoped the boy would get a better education in the United States, she said.

Still, Alonzo said her husband had doubts and at one point decided he did not want to take the boy. But that upset the boy, so they resolved he should go.

Alonzo's sobs could be heard for minutes outside the house before she came out to be interviewed. Afterwards she went back inside to a tiny altar she had adorned with three photos of the boy that a local school teacher had printed out for her.

The altar stood to one side of a room with cement walls that serves as a bedroom and living area for Alonzo and her three surviving children. Adjoining it was a kitchen with a dirt floor and wooden walls.

Her husband remains in U.S. custody.

""NOW OR NEVER""

Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's Foreign Ministry, said smugglers known as ""coyotes"" often encourage migrants to take children as a form of ""visa."" Many coyotes, she noted, are trusted by migrant families, so their word carries weight.

But Lucas Perez, the mayor of Yalambojoch, said some coyotes are only interested in ripping off people. Still, for many migrants trying to cross the U.S. border, taking a child along was the ""only option,"" he told Reuters.

Describing migration from the area as ""constant,"" Perez estimated about 200 people from the tiny village live in the United States.

Agustin Gomez, the boy's father, has two brothers in the United States he hoped to meet, his wife said.

Next to her hut, labourers worked on a two-story concrete house with a twin-gabled, tiled roof - evidence of the money coming back from the United States, the mayor said.

Under U.S. law, families from countries that do not border the United States cannot be immediately deported, and because of a longstanding legal settlement, there are restrictions on how long U.S. authorities can detain migrant children.

As a result, families with children are often released to await an immigration court hearing, which can be scheduled well into the future due to ballooning backlogs.

U.S. President Donald Trump has tried to reverse the policy, which he calls ""catch and release,"" but has been blocked by lawsuits in federal court.

His Democratic opponents have seized on the deaths of the two Guatemalan children to attack his policies. On Thursday, Senator Dianne Feinstein urged the Senate to hold a hearing in the new year on how children are treated in U.S. custody.

In the meantime, Trump's insistence on building a southern border wall has given coyotes a fresh argument to promote migration, Larra said.

""According to interviews (with migrants), the coyotes are saying 'it's now or never' because the wall is going to be built, and it won't be possible to cross,"" she said.

In another context, Winston Churchill said, ""I am a man of simple tastes easily satisfied with the best."" That is what ""excellence"" is - the best you know, the best you can. However, there is one difference: the best is the ultimate (what we learnt in school: good, better, best), whereas excellence is ever changing. No limit, because excellence is ""improving"" every day, every hour, every minute, every moment. Lincolns and Churchills are not an exception, anyone and everyone can do their best in whatever they do. Everyone wants success and happiness

There are innumerable written and spoken words by motivational speakers, management gurus, and spiritual leaders about how to achieve success and happiness in life. They revolve around a variety of attributes like courage, confidence, concentration, education, enthusiasm, self-esteem, attitude, time management, the list can go on. The real learning starts at birth, at home and then at school. Character building also starts here. Abraham Lincoln's letter to his son's teacher is a testimony of parental anxiety for inculcating courage, honesty, integrity, sublime faith, in their children. Careers generally grow on this foundation. Excellence is hammered in young age with emphasis on ""examination marks"" in competition with others. Anything above 90 percent is considered excellent. First, second, and third rank is the criteria of superior performance. The question to be asked ought to be: Have you done your ""best""? Not the rank. Not the number of marks. Think of an Olympian. He/she works hard for 4 years trying to improve in those 1460 days (365 x 4). That does not mean that everyone will get gold. What matters is one's individual effort, competition with one's own self, not competition with others. Ask yourself: have I done my best? Martin Luther King, Jr. explains excellence beautifully thus: ""If a man is called to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as a Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven composed music, or Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, 'Here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well'. Aristotle expressed excellence in a slightly different way: ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore is not an act, but a habit."" Start your journey of excellence

When, where, and how to start? Anytime, anywhere, the choice is yours. The society needs ""excellent physicists, excellent construction workers, excellent legislators, excellent first-grade teachers"". One may be brilliant, average, or mediocre in studies but everyone must strive for excellence in life skills. An often overlooked aspect of excellence is the right ""tools"" that we need to use to achieve excellence. Based on his own experiences in teaching , research, industry, management and, training, the present author has identified 5 core ""tools""/""skills"": positive attitude, communication skills (all the four, speaking, listening, reading, and writing), self-esteem, enthusiasm, and humility. If you have them, sharpen them, and if not, learn and practice them yourself or through coaching. This does not make other 'tools' less important. Remind yourself that learning is a life-long process. Develop passion for excellence

Excellence is a powerful word, it stirs mind. It cannot be thrust on anyone, like greatness can be. ""To achieve excellence, we must cultivate passion and trust"", say Tom Peters and Nancy Austin in their classic 'A Passion for Excellence' (1985). Passion for excellence is not free, it carries a price. The authors elaborate further: ""It is a personal commitment. Doing better than average takes tenacious preparation. You need courage and self-respect. It's believing that something can be done . The price of excellence is time, energy, attention, and focus. Excellence is a high cost item"".

YALAMBOJOCH, Guatemala (Reuters) - Between heavy sobs, Catarina Alonzo explained that when her husband left Guatemala to try to reach the United States, they hoped taking their 8-year-old son would make it easier for the pair to get in. Instead, the boy fell ill and died.

Detained on the U.S. border, Felipe Gomez Alonzo died late on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital a few weeks after setting off with his father, becoming the second Guatemalan child to die this month while in U.S. custody.

The two deaths have led to renewed criticism of the Trump administration's hardline stance on illegal immigration, as well as fresh scrutiny of why some migrants from Central America travel with children on the long, dangerous road north.

"120","p-1027744739","2018-12-27","http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/researchers-link-realism-blockchains-promise","Researchers link realism to blockchains promise","pressreleasepoint.com",FALSE,"Depending on who you ask, blockchain technology is poised to revolutionize the world -- from creating a universal currency to building a free and truly private internet. Or, the new technology, built with a combination of encryption and transparency, is a solution in search of a problem.

The reality likely falls somewhere in between. While a growing number of startups and researchers are devoting themselves to exploring blockchain's full potential, experts caution that a healthy dose of skepticism is needed to fully evaluate the technology and its eventual place in society.

For many individuals, though -- including some looking to invest -- blockchain technologies and their limitations remain poorly understood, leaving people vulnerable to being exploited by bad actors. Researchers at Princeton University's School of Engineering and Applied Science are striving to change that through education, outreach and research.

""Early on we realized this was a technology that was not well understood but that a lot of people were interested in,"" said Ed Felten, the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science and Public Affairs at Princeton. ""There wasn't a coherent, high-quality way of teaching about this technology or explaining it, so we've tried to systematize the knowledge and unsolved problems underlying it.""

Simply put, a blockchain is a ledger. But unlike an old-time hotel register gathering dust on a counter, a blockchain ledger is held electronically in multiple locations across the internet. It is visible to any member of the community participating in that particular blockchain. Each copy of the ledger is held on a computer called a node; when someone makes a transaction using the blockchain -- say using virtual currency to order a pizza -- the operators of the nodes run through calculations to create a new entry, or block, in the ledger. Each new block is encrypted using a private, numeric key from the person who bought the pizza; the new blocks are also linked to the previous blocks using additional encryption.

The combination of encryption and visibility makes entries extremely difficult to fake. Because the calculations are carried out on multiple nodes and the results are visible to participants -- varying results would be an immediate red flag. The distributed nature of the system means it is hard for a single entity to control. It also makes transactions extremely difficult to track back to a user.

The initial use of blockchain technology was in new forms of currency such as Bitcoin. More recently, the ability to track decentralized transactions reliably has attracted other sectors. Businesses are exploring its use for contracts, app development and international finance.

""I think this will be a story of gradual integration, rather than a story of a revolution,"" said Arvind Narayanan, an associate professor of computer science at Princeton. ""It's an interesting new technology, and a number of us here are working to make that technical footing even stronger.""

In 2014, Narayanan began teaching one of the first university courses on blockchain, which he and Felten soon expanded into an online Coursera series and a popular textbook. At the same time, with colleagues and former and current students, they began innovating ways to maximize the benefits of blockchain and minimize the risks. ""There's a lot at stake, and a lot not understood about this technology,"" Felten said. ""As independent academics, the role we try to play is to be explainers, interpreters and b.s. detectors.""

That said, Felten and Narayanan believe that blockchain does have a significant role to play -- although, most likely, we have yet to imagine what it will be. ""In some sense, we're still in search of its major application,"" Felten said.

Numerous Princeton alumni are attempting to fill that unknown by becoming early innovators in the field, including a co-founder of the cryptocurrency Ethereum and founders of several high-profile companies, such as Blockstack (see list below). Where they will take these and other ventures depends not only on technical finesse, but imagination.

Blockchain's most prominent use so far has been in creating cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, that are not controlled by a central bank. These currencies are not blockchains themselves -- they are abstract tokens -- but trades of their coins are recorded on blockchains. Because ownership and any transfer of ownership is recorded on the public ledger, participants in the Bitcoin system do not need to trust any one entity. Instead, they place their trust in the distributed ledger technology, which is maintained by a large number of participants around the world.

Each cryptocurrency offers a limited number of coins, although new ones are regularly created and doled out as payment to users, called miners, who are the first to solve the difficult computational problems -- the harsh puzzles -- added to the chain. Miners' computers run algorithms that perform the difficult task of building blockchain records and solving mathematical problems. In exchange, they receive coins.

While this sounds abstract, Felten points out that the system actually has much in common with conventional currencies. ""Most money we have exists in numbers on some computer somewhere,"" he said. ""If you go into a sandwich shop, they give you a sandwich in exchange for you telling a bank to move numbers from one account to another."" Like paper money, he continues, cryptocurrencies have value because their supply is limited, and because users can be confident that they can exchange them for goods and services. Cryptocurrencies now trade against the dollar, and their combined market cap is over $100 billion.

Among their biggest attractions, cryptocurrencies offer a way to transfer money over distances and borders without involving intermediaries that may charge high fees. In other cases, certain cryptocurrencies possess advanced features, including the ability to create smart contracts, or self-enforcing rules that govern escrow arrangements and other interactions.

Blockchain is still in its infancy, though, so the true scope of its usefulness is likely yet to be revealed.

""It's kind of an analogy to the early days of the internet, where some people were super excited and made a lot of claims about how it would change human existence forever, and some said it was just a fad,"" Felten said. ""While it didn't solve all of humanity's problems, it did turn out to be pretty important.""

But for all the interesting current and future uses for blockchain, he added, there is ""an extraordinary amount of snake oil and exaggeration in the public rhetoric."" Because some cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous, for example, they are particularly attractive for criminal groups, including those looking to exchange illegal goods. In other cases, less savvy users are exploited through ""pump and dump schemes"" in which unscrupulous investors artificially boost the price of a hot commodity and then quickly sell, causing a crash. ""There are a huge number of scams going on,"" Narayanan warned.

Blockchain is also extremely energy intensive, mostly due to mining, which requires specialized equipment with a high demand for electricity. Bitcoin mining alone accounts for about 0.1 percent of total world energy use -- more energy than certain countries, including Denmark and Ireland, consume. As Narayanan testified before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in August, this represents a serious problem for energy use and the environment.

From the early days, Princeton researchers have been striving to mitigate some of these issues and to better understand the technology and its potential.

""Bitcoin is portrayed in the media as jumping into existence from the mind of one mysterious person, but I co-authored a paper on the component technologies of cryptocurrencies that cited literature from the early 1980s,"" Narayanan said. ""Continuing to improve on cryptocurrency and blockchain will take a lot more computer science research.""

BlockSci, for example, is a database that Narayanan and his colleagues built to analyze hundreds of millions of Bitcoin transactions. BlockSci allows them to investigate trends and to answer questions such as how much money is actually being transferred and how much privacy users truly have.

""There are lots of interesting scientific and commercial questions we can ask with these data,"" Narayanan said. A recent investigation revealed, for example, that bitcoins are changing hands less often than what was previously assumed -- about 1.4 times per month -- suggesting that individuals are using coins less as currency and more as investments.

Princeton students and graduates are also pushing the field forward, by creating apps and writing software to improve cryptocurrencies; founding companies based on blockchain; and funding such ventures. Joseph Lubin, one of the founders of Ethereum, graduated from Princeton in 1987 with a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.

One recent venture, Basis, founded by Princeton computer science alumni Nader Al-Naji, Lawrence Diao and Josh Chen, recently raised $133 million for effort to build a cryptocurrency that maintains a more stable price than conventional blockchain-based ""coins."" The Basis system creates the virtual equivalent of a central bank, which automatically adjust the supply of currency, based on demand.

One recent Princeton alumni venture, Blockstack, aims to build a completely decentralized internet based on blockchain. According to co-founders Ryan Shea (2012 BSE in mechanical and aerospace engineering) and Muneeb Ali (2017 Ph.D. in computer science), Blockstack, which is registered as a public benefit corporation, was inspired by major issues they perceived in the way the internet works, including concerns about personal data and autonomy.

""We saw that a lack of competition and lack of control for the end user was really hampering freedom, security and privacy around the world,"" Shea said. ""We wanted to build a new system that empowers the individual and allows each of us to own our data.""

Rather than Facebook storing and controlling all of a person's data on its servers, for example, a Blockstack user could easily migrate his or her digital identity from app to app, if desired. Blockstack software for managing profiles and securing accounts is already available, as are decentralized messenger and document editor apps. Next year, the company plans to release its own blockchain in tandem with a Blockstack token, and discussions are underway for creating a decentralized Twitter.

""We're working with lots of teams to help them build whatever apps they desire on the platform,"" Shea says. ""The most exciting things are less around the exact details of the underlying infrastructure we provide and more around how we enable developers to create new experiences.""

Blockstack is already coming full circle by inspiring and enabling other Princeton scholars to create new technologies. At the Keller Center for Innovation in Engineering Education's eLab Summer Accelerator Program in August, a team of new Princeton graduates launched Afari, a Blockstack-based social media platform meant to give data privacy back to the people by returning data ownership and privacy to users, and by giving everyone an equal chance for their voice to be heard and rewarded.

""Social media is so broken in our opinion that you need to redesign it from the ground up,"" said Avthar Sewrathan, co-founder of Afari and a 2018 graduate in computer science. Blockchain, the team said, makes that possible. ""When you make a post on Afari,"" said co-founder Felix Madutsa, ""your data is not stored with us but rather is stored on a decentralized system that you, the user, controls and owns.""

A sampling of Princeton University alumni and alumni ventures playing prominent roles in blockchain-related work:

Afari was launched in 2018 as part of the Keller Center's eLab Summer Accelerator program by 2018 computer science alumni Richard Adjei, Felix Madutsa and Avthar Sewrathan along with junior May Jiang and sophomore Seyoon Ragavan.

Blockstack, a public benefit corporation, was founded by founded by alumni, Muneeb Ali, who earned his Ph.D. in computer science from Princeton in 2017, and Ryan Shea, who earned his BSE in mechanical and aerospace engineering in 2012. Princeton computer science professors Michael Freedman and JP Singh are technical advisers to the company.

Commonwealth Crypto was co-founded by Sharon Goldberg, who earned her Ph.D. in electrical engineering at Princeton in 2009 and is now the company's chief executive officer.

Ethereum, a blockchain-based computing platform that supports the Ether cryptocurrency, was co-founded by 1987 alumnus Joseph Lubin.

Michael Novogratz, who earned his undergraduate degree in economics at Princeton in 1987 and is a leading cryptocurrency investor, spoke on the subject at the 2018 Princeton Reunions.

Emin Gün Sirer earned his BSE in computer science from Princeton in 1993 and is an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University where he co-directs the Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts. He is the founder of the company bloXroute and author of the blog Hacking, Distributed."

Phil Murphy, center, visited Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs on July 25 to announce two statewide programs aimed at supporting new and established innovative businesses in New Jersey. Pictured from left to right are Tim Sullivan, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, Anne-Marie Maman, president of the New Jersey Business Incubation Network and executive director of the Princeton Entrepreneurship Council; Debbie Hart, president and chief executive officer of BioNJ; Princeton President Christopher L. Eisgruber; and State Treasurer Elizabeth Maher Muoio.

The year 2018 represented a pivotal point in the development of an innovation ecosystem in the heart of New Jersey as Princeton University established significant new collaborations with pioneering members of industry -- all with the aim of bolstering the resources available to researchers and scientists in their quest to make new discoveries in the service of society.

As President Christopher L. Eisgruber noted in July, standing alongside New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy at Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs, ""We believe that these cross-sector partnerships will foster a vibrant innovation ecosystem with the potential to generate transformative ideas, benefit the regional economy and attract top talent -- outcomes that will make central New Jersey an increasingly attractive place for all who live, learn and work here.""

The year kicked off with the opening of the Biolabs facility in Plainsboro at the Princeton Forrestal Center, and closed with Google and the University announcing that a new artificial intelligence laboratory would open in the town of Princeton in January. In between were other developments such as an agreement between the Princeton Catalysis Initiative (PCI) and Celgene Corp., and a Princeton-Microsoft agreement to research biofilms.

Murphy came to the Biolabs site to announce two initiatives to jumpstart the state's innovation ecosystem.

""It's right here in places like this across our state where the innovation economy will be reborn and once again dominate in New Jersey,"" Murphy said. ""These are the spaces where the next great leaps in technology and the life sciences will be made by new companies doing leading-edge research and development.""

These new relationships are described below, drawing from University announcements and related stories.

BioLabs opened in May, taking a major leap in connecting the talent and resources at Princeton to the larger New Jersey entrepreneurial network.

The 31,000-square-foot-facility includes wet labs, dry labs and co-working spaces for Princeton-related tech and life science startups and for companies throughout the region.

""Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs is one of several initiatives designed to strengthen the innovation ecosystem in central New Jersey and thereby expand the impact of Princeton's teaching and research,"" President Eisgruber said at the ceremonial ribbon-cutting.

The facility is designed to encourage collaboration, with shared work areas and many types of meeting spaces where scientists and entrepreneurs can share techniques and spark new ideas.

Eleven companies are tenants of the incubator space, spanning biotechnology, medical devices, battery technology and clean technology. Two of the companies have been spun out of the University by faculty, based on work in their labs: HIT Nano, which focuses on low-cost and high-performance lithium-ion batteries and led by Yiguang Ju, the Robert Porter Patterson Professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and director of the Program in Sustainable Energy; and Optimeos, which focuses on building nanoparticles for pharmaceutical use and co-founded by Robert Prud'homme, professor of chemical and biological engineering, and Shahram Hejazi, venture capitalist and professional specialist in electrical engineering and the Keller Center for Innovations in Engineering Education.

Princeton Innovation Center BioLabs won Innovator of the Year from the Regional Chamber of Commerce during their gala awards ceremony in late November.

At the start of 2018, the Princeton Catalysis Initiative launched with the goal of accelerating interdisciplinary collaboration on catalysis across the University and with industry. On Nov. 1, PCI established its first industrial collaboration, a 10-year, $6 million commitment from Celgene Corp.

Catalysis is a key technological driver for solutions to many outstanding problems of increasing social concern, including the development of alternative energy technologies, environmental remediation strategies, access to novel pharmaceuticals and antibiotics, sustainable agriculture, and renewable soft materials.

""PCI will be an academic incubator for new fields of research that will have significant benefit for society,"" said David MacMillan, the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor of Chemistry and director of PCI. ""Princeton is uniquely positioned to be the leader in this movement, and in collaboration with Celgene we expect to make discoveries that will significantly impact human health over the next 10 years and beyond. Celgene brings much more than funding -- collaborators, ideas, and new opportunities for innovation and cross-pollination.""

""We are incredibly excited to enter into this collaboration with the Princeton Catalysis Initiative, said Lawrence Hamann, vice president for chemistry at Celgene. ""The opportunity to engage with absolutely world-class investigators in such a diverse range of scientific fields aligned with Celgene's broad research interests represents a unique and powerful means to advance some cutting-edge basic science.""

Princeton chemistry professors Abigail Doyle and David MacMillan explain catalysis in this video.

As a global research university and leader in innovation, Princeton cultivates mutually beneficial relationships with companies to support the University's educational, scientific and scholarly mission. The University is guided by the principle that initiatives to fortify and connect with the innovation ecosystem will advance Princeton's role as an internationally renowned institution of higher education and accelerate its ability to have greater impact in the world.

The University's relationship with Microsoft is one of its most extensive with industry, spanning collaborations in computer science, cybersecurity and biomedical research.

On Nov. 29, Princeton and Microsoft announced they are teaming up on the leading edge of microbiology and computational research modeling research.

Microsoft is helping Princeton to better understand the mechanisms of biofilm formation by providing advanced technology that will greatly extend the type of research analysis capable today. Biofilms -- surface-associated communities of bacteria -- are the leading cause of microbial infection worldwide and kill as many people as cancer does. They are also a leading cause of antibiotic resistance, a problem highlighted by the World Health Organization as ""a global crisis that we cannot ignore."" Understanding how biofilms form could enable new strategies to disrupt them.

To support Princeton, a Microsoft team led by Dr. Andrew Phillips, head of the Biological Computation group at Microsoft Research, will be working closely with Bonnie Bassler, a global pioneer in microbiology who is the Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology and chair of the Department of Molecular Biologyat Princeton and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, and with Ned Wingreen, the Howard A. Prior Professor in the Life Sciences and professor of molecular biology and the Lewis-Sigler Institute for Integrative Genomics.

Using the power of Microsoft's cloud and advanced machine learning, Princeton will be able to study different strains of biofilms in new ways to better understand how they work. Microsoft is contributing a cloud-based prototype that can be used for biological modeling and experimentation that will be deployed at Princeton.

""This collaboration enables us to bring together advances in computing and microbiology in powerful new ways,"" said Brad Smith, president of Microsoft. ""This partnership can help us unlock answers that we hope someday may help save millions of people around the world.""

""By combining our distinctive strengths, Princeton and Microsoft will increase our ability to make the discoveries needed to improve lives and serve society,"" said Christopher L. Eisgruber, president of Princeton University. ""Technology is creating new possibilities for collaboration, and we hope this venture will inspire other innovative partnerships in the years ahead.""

During a visit to campus earlier in the year, Smith, a Princeton alumnus, gave a talk about the growing role of artificial intelligence and its implications for society. He called for people with varied backgrounds and expertise in humanities and public policy to join in discussions to ensure the fair and ethical use of the new technologies.

Google and the University announced Dec . 18 that the company will open an artificial intelligence lab in the town of Princeton in January. Computer science professors Elad Hazan and Yoram Singer will lead the effort, splitting their time working for Google and Princeton.

The lab at 1 Palmer Square will begin with a small number of faculty members, graduate and undergraduate student researchers, recent graduates and software engineers.

Work in the lab will focus on a discipline within artificial intelligence known as machine learning, in which computers learn from existing information and develop the ability to draw conclusions and make decisions in new situations that were not in the original data.

In congratulating the University and Google on the new venture, Gov. Murphy said it's another great step in the innovation economy here in New Jersey."" The governor said he looks forward to ""a great collaboration in artificial intelligence for years to come.""

Citing Princeton's long and groundbreaking involvement in computing, Emily Carter, the dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, said, ""This collaboration is another excellent example of how fundamental insights in mathematics and theoretical computer science drive new technologies with benefits far beyond the original domain of the work.""

Jennifer Rexford, chair of the Department of Computer Science, said the new venture comes at a time of significant growth in computer science and related areas of data science at the University. ""It's an exciting opportunity to work with a leading company while also maintaining the strong academic independence and freedom that is essential to Princeton,"" she said."

He passed on instructions to the concerned officers to strategize and work on these lines so that Downtown dwellers have right to these basic amenities in the first instance.

During the tour many delegations from different area interacted with Mayor and put forth thier issues.

On this, Mayor passed on directions for speedy disposal of public grievances. At Saderbal area, Mattu stressed on need of development and maintenance of specific Ghats in order to restore these Ghats.

The representatives of Imambara at Hassanabad requested Mayor to provide assistance in building infrastructure of Imambara.

On this Mayor assured full support and directed the concerned officers to gear up for initiating the process for the said work as soon as possible.

Mattu also visited Government High School at Kathi Maidan and said that there is a lack of proper infrastructure for which the matter needs to be taken up with Director Education.

Besides this, a dispensary lacking manpower at Haakh Bazar was also inspected .

While visiting shrine at Shiekh Colony Kani Devar Hawal, Mayor after interacting with its locals gave directions to the concerned officers to conduct tiling work of approaching road that connects towards the shrine.

A marriage hall that was in shambles at Kani Devaar was also inspected by Mattu. It was decided that the marriage hall needs to be fully renovated before its utilization for public, the spokesperson added."

Insecurity grips the heart. We live in a world of sharp contrast -a world of private affluence and public squalor where 20% of world population controls 80% per cent of world's resources. We live in a world where natural and human-made calamities have intensified. Religious fanaticism and terrorism continues to haunt world's peace. Materialism grips almost every activity into its fist. Human value is measured in terms of wealth. Honesty, truthfulness and hard work seem to have lost its honourable seat in modern society. The space of individualism grows and the space of solidarity life is shrinking each day. Even God is privatised by religious fanatics creating division in the society. Traditional food system and cultural heritages get dislocated causing identity crisis of million indigenous people. More than anyone, children worry greatly about their future. With invasive invasion of modern technology, human have become partly human being and partly machine. Modernity is unsuccessfully trying to make this world a better place to live in. Life of all forms is threatened in one way or the other. Today's generation is like what the Judges said: Everyone does as he sees fit (Judges. 21: 25). Where is the solidarity life of God's good creation?

Are we going back to the state of 'chaos and disorderliness' of creation? Did not Jesus promise God's Kingdom here on earth where equality, love and fullness of life will prevail? Should not we, as the bearers of the image of God, fight against those forces that are destroying solidarity life in the world?

With this introduction, this paper begins with what solidarity is and followed by the various probable factors that are responsible for the breaking down of solidarity life. It then goes on to discuss the biblical-theological basis of solidarity and conclusion.

1. Solidarity:

Biblically speaking, the image given by St Paul of the Body of Christ (that we are all individual parts that together make up the Body of Christ) gives us a visual way to think of solidarity life. Solidarity is about valuing our fellow human beings and respecting who they are as individuals. It is a simple fact that we cannot live and exist well independently of others, we are interdependent beings. Solidarity looks upon this interdependence as something good, something positive, a thing to be cherished. Solidarity ""is not a feeling of vague compassion or shallow distress at the misfortunes of so many people, both near and far. On the contrary, it is a firm and persevering determination to commit oneself to the common good; that is to say to the good of all and of each individual, because we are all really responsible for all""

We are all one family in the world. Building a community that empowers everyone to attain their full potential through respecting each other's dignity, rights and responsibilities makes the world a better place to live. No one can remain insensitive to the inequalities that persist in the world. We have to offer the world a valuable lesson in solidarity.

The intense situation of inequality, poverty and injustice, are signs not only of a profound lack of fraternity, but also of the absence of a culture of solidarity. New ideologies, characterized by rampant individualism, egocentrism and materialistic consumerism, weaken social bonds, fuelling that ""throw away"" mentality which leads to contempt for, and the abandonment of, the weakest and those considered ""useless"". For too long the world had being believing the false ideology of 'survival of the fittest' that it is almost leading to the total collapse of solidarity life. We need to take care of our neighbours who need our help. Solidarity is simply the demand of fraternity, that we treat each other as brothers and sisters.

2. Some Significant Factors That

Destroy Solidarity Life

We are using everything at our disposal as dividing factor and not for uniting factor like modern education, religion, technology, etc. Life does not exist where there is disunity, conflict and loveless society. Life can be fully experienced only when there is solidarity with each other. Some of the factors that need to be tackled to bring solidarity are discussed as follows:

A. Patriarchy: Patriarchy is power struggle starting from one's own family to the world's level. It is not confined to man's control over woman. It is a power structure interwoven with caste and class hierarchical structures, the state, organised religion, leading to violence, colonialism, war and ecological destruction. Hence patriarchy destroys solidarity life of not only men and women but also of different nations and human and nature.

B.Modern Capitalism: Liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (often known as LPG) are the three pillars of modern capitalism. Modern capitalism rejoices in survival of the fittest. Accumulation of wealth is highly valued. Profit is its aim. Liberalisation means simply free global market and free trade. It destroys the economy of petty traders and small local farmers. Privatisation implies selling or leasing out public goods and services to individuals or private companies. Under this, many states' owned factories, airport, educational institutions or hospitals are privatised. For instance, we have many hospitals of international standard but poor people find it difficult to afford the facilities. Many small farmers also sold out their land to the rich capitalists. Modern capitalism employs globalisation as a tool of controlling the whole world. It pushes for a homogenous world culture - culture of the minority elite class, in order to control everything.

The capitalists being the owner of both capital and land, they also become the owner of production factors (machines and labourers) as well. In capitalism, people do not think about the wellbeing of neighbours. Its main concern is accumulating money and power. In that process of accumulation, violence, exploitation and discrimination became a necessity. Life of solidarity is obstructed and turned the world into a place full of horrors. Blinded by mammon, human had chosen death over life. Even the state acts as crony capitalism neglecting the welfare of common people. Modern capitalism is blamed for creating division in the society, causing worldwide unrest and destroying nature.

C. Modern education: Modern education has become an established norm to think that all education is good and the more one has the better. It is not regarded as a problem although the lack of it is. 'A child out of school has no chance in the world of tomorrow' is what become people's slogan. What is being taught in the school is hardly questioned. Modern education promotes competition as the most desirable value. Analysing our today's context, it may not be wrong to say that 'My success is my neighbour's sorrow' and vice-versa. It has put every child into 'pressure cooker' of competition as both parents and teachers pressurized their ward to compete others at any cost. Competition not only creates insecurity in children's mind but they also lose their leisure time and refreshing health. Modern education favours individual effort, work and success over team work, solidarity and co-operation. It inculcates individualism. Communitarian life is at its lowest ebb. Individualism is at its highest peak.

Creativity of mind and hand gives way to memorization method of education. According to Ivan Illich, teachers pour expert culture (knowledge) from outside. Those who have better memory power and secure good marks are considered 'intelligent'. Despite possessing creative minds, those who cannot secure good makes in exams were dropped out as 'failures'. Once again, the elite culture and survival of the fittest is endorsed by educational institutions.

Prizes are awarded to the so called 'brilliant students' who comprised only 1% at the expense of 99%. In many educational institutions, free admission and tuition fees are provided to first class students. Examination marks thus become the deciding factor of one's status. Giving incentive or awards can lead to rigorous competition of students against each other that can lead to deadly individualism. A society without communitarian spirit is doomed to collapse.

Interestingly, modern education does not even believe quality education as producing responsible individuals in a society. It however considers quality education as a mode of preparing people for high salaried jobs. Hence, the main focus of education is on imparting academic knowledge, training the students to pass examinations and secure jobs, not on transforming the individual and society. Today we may need to revisit the basic education system envisaged by Mahatma Gandhi as we try to build up solidarity life.

D. Consumerism: The Dalai Lama, when asked what surprised him most about humanity, he said: ""Man. Because he sacrifices his health in order to make money. Then he sacrifices money to recuperate his health. And then he is so anxious about the future that he does not enjoy the present; the result being that he does not live in the present or the future; he lives as if he is never going to die, and then dies having never really lived.""

This stark individualism has been fomented by many factors, not least the consumer culture that drives late modern capitalism. Given sufficient money, the consumer is sovereign, satisfying one's desires and improving life. Or so the advertisers tell us. The advertising world has made us to believe as true what is not true. The logic of consumer culture requires us to want ever more and to continue believing that those purchased products and services will make us better -- sexier, healthier, happier. What consumer culture cannot tolerate is contentment, a sense that our provision is sufficient. Instead, it requires restlessness, endless striving, eternal competition and insecurity.

In pursuit of our unlimited wants, we have not only spoilt our life but also that of others. Social solidarity life matters. We have forgotten that material things cannot provide what human friendship provides.

Consumerism is much more than wishing a so-called higher living standard. It is the attitude and conviction which finds the meaning of life and the purpose of economic activity in access to an ever widening and rapidly changing range of commodities. It is becoming socially accepted orientation that determines social status so that a person's status depends on the gadget one possesses. Greed and corruption are fruits of consumerist culture. Consciously or unconsciously, many Christians are also influenced by consumerist culture and became materialistic. This culture delineates us from each other and breaks the bond of love.

E. Modern technology and Development: Modern technology promises 'heaven on earth' but it in contrary has stolen away 'heaven from earth' from our life. The relationship within the immediate human beings, human and nature and human and God is widened by modern technology. Most of the time, we relate to each other only through technology. We are tempted to believe that modern science is good and technology is the solution to all our problems. However, we need to be aware that with the non-stop invention of scientific technologies there is also increasing number of crimes, conflicts, and unrest in all parts of the world. Even human worth is measured by the kind and quantity of technology one possessed.

Sir Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton and others who paved way for the development of modern science treat nature as dead matter to be exploited and use for human benefit. He believed that nature must be ""bound into service"" and made a ""slave"". This anthropocentric -reductionist science then become at the root of the growing ecological crisis. It destroys life and threatens survival. The earth is rapidly dying: her forests, her soils her waters, her air are dying. With the destruction of forests, water and land, we are losing our life-support systems.

Introduction of modern technology have enormous effect not only nature but also on the poor. Eighty per cent of all scientific research is devoted to the war industry which clearly indicates the nexus between modern science and violence. Tools of economic production have become tools of war: Using of power tiller for ploughing fields or trawler for fishing had destroyed the means of livelihoods for millions of people.

Nuclear reactors & weapons pose great threat to both human beings and nature. Random abortion (sex selection) especially female child are done with the help of modern technology. Vivisection is performed to millions of living species every year for experiment. Modern science appears to be challenging God today as it plays with life without any respect.

Millions of people are displaced by modern development. Many tribal areas in India are under a state of siege as tribals and adivasis who persistently protect natural resources are hunted down by coercive forces of the state in collaboration with multi-national companies.

We are told that violence is necessary for development, progress, and a better life for all of us. It is usually only understood and recognized by those who are directly affected by it. Even then, the promise of a better life is supposed to be a consolation, although any chance for a better life has, in fact, been sacrificed! In India's context it is the tribals or adivasis who always sacrifice for others. The rich and the powerful hardly made any concession for the greater common good or for nation.

F. Religion: Religion is supposed to play an important role in bidning together human society. Although all religions teach about love, peace, justice and life, in practice, they do not bring solidarity to the world's community. The terror activities of the many faith adherents are dangerously extending its tentacles to many countries. The religious fanatics of Hindus, Muslims and Christians are vigorously raising its head in India threatening the peaceful coexistence of people of different faiths.

E. Ethnic Chauvinism: There is growing ethnic division in our society. Many ethnic leaders (inclusive of political, civil and underground leaders) are using ethnic and tribal card to grab power and to stay in their leadership post. Common people fell into this trap without realising the hidden ploy played by these cunning leaders who think not for the common good but for their own survival.

3. Christian Perspectives of Solidarity

The calling of the people of God is not simply to live in isolated lives as individuals but to live in koinonia or fellowship. The human are, therefore, to live in community, in intimate fellowship with one another and with God. The Bible begins with fundamental questions of solidarity: ""Adam where are you?"" and ""Cain where is your brother Abel?"" However, the answer of the fallen being was, ""Am I my brother's keeper""? We are responsible for each other even as Jesus came to this world to show his solidarity with us. Quoting from the

Book of Isaiah (61:1f), Jesus delivered the Nazareth Manifesto: The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to bring the good news to the afflicted. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to captives, sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim a year of favour from the Lord."" - (Luke 4.18f).He said again in Mark 10.45, ""For the Son of man himself came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many"" He even taught us what greatest love is from John 15.13, ""No one can have greater love than to lay down his life for his friends.""

However, we continue to possess not-in-my-backyard attitude and ask ""Am I my brother's keeper"" (Genesis 4:9) and ""who is my neighbour"" (Luke 10: 25-37). The 'neighbour...not man in general but the man who meets me time and again in the context of life...is to be loved as 'one myself' not as 'I love myself.' We need to relate to anyone in need and treat him/her as a person, a human like my own 'self'. Such concern can help us build solidarity.

There are many other biblical where Jesus demonstrated his solidarity with people. In this mutual understanding and friendship, we must also begin to work together to build the common future of the human race. Jesus told his disciples not to be like 'gentiles' who tried to 'lord over' each other. As long as people tried to control and oppress each other, there cannot be solidarity. Jesus personally entered into the temple to challenge the various forms exploitations taking place in the temple.

People who had dealings with the Romans (notably the 'tax-farmers' such as Zacchaeus and Matthew or Levi) were despised as collaborators. Women were always legally minors, under the authority first of their male relatives and then of their husbands, and lacked status outside the home in any case; but those forced into prostitution by divorce or widowhood were completely outside the bounds of acceptability.

People who were deemed ritually impure because of disfigurement, leprosy, haemorrhage or insanity were shunned and forced to live apart. And of the man born blind Jesus' own disciples could cruelly ask: ""Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents that he should have been born blind?"" (John 9.2). Jesus lived in solidarity with all types of people.

Bible said we should not steal. The alternative was hard work with our own hands. But the main purpose was not merely to hoard or even to have. The purpose was ""to have to give."" ""Let him labour, working with his hands, that he may have to give to him who is in need"" (Eph. 4:28). This is not a justification for being rich in order to give more. It is a call to make more and keep less so you can give more. Capitalism is creating havoc today. If Jesus had been with us today, he might have said to the capitalists, ""Man shall not live by bread alone.""

Jesus aid that if anyone wants to be great, then they must be servant of all. The Son of Man came to serve not to be served. Jesus taught us to develop greatness through serving but not through served. Serving does not mean that we should be pushover but as an example to others. We have the responsibility to transform ferocious wolves into lambs and lions into sheep so that we can build a society of solidarity without harming each other. It is time to build up harmonious relationship with everyone transcending village, tribe and factional interest. The Prophet Isaiah said that a time will come when 'the wolf and the lamb will live together, the calf and the lion will graze together and a little child will lead them' (Isaiah 11:6).

Jesus rejected individualism. He came to this world to be with the people- the struggling masses. He came not to seek personal status and fame. He did not try to live a successful life if we considered success in terms of education, wealth and political status which he could have them all as offered to him (Matthew 4:1-11). These are considered as 'temptations' by Jesus. Wealth, fame and power lead to conflict and war and destroy solidarity.

Jesus' life and death not only establishes relationship but sustains it. He continuously sets right the broken relationship between God and human and human to and human. We are called to make peace. Bible says, ""Blessed are the peacemakers....(Matt 5:9). Is it not surprise that the blessing is on the peacemakers not the peace keepers? Peacemakers are called the children of God. Those who bring division among people are doing the devil's work.

CONCLUSION: People's hope on modern capitalism as solution to all problems proved wrong. Rather it has destroyed solidarity life of the people. Modern education fails to bring equality as it promotes survival of the fittest where the interest of the weak and the poor are neglected. Modern technology has become the extended hand of the rich to control others and exploit nature. Many women continue to suffer under the ghost of patriarchy. Ethnicism is becoming a great threat to harmony and peaceful coexistence. Consumerism has neglected the wellbeing of neighbours. Today even God is made a personal consumerist good.

Without solidarity, there will be insecurity, threats and violence of all forms. What we need today is 'survival of the solidarity'. No society will last long in the absence of solidarity. Lack of solidarity shows spiritual bankruptcy. Even success is not success if it does not bring benefit to the whole society, in other word, solidarity. The wolves need to repent from their oppressive and dominating and the lambs need to regain their forgiving and hospitable nature. The oppressed groups are naturally forgiving and very generous even with the little they have. The privileged groups must repent and accept forgiveness from those they hurt through exploitation and oppression."

From the instant the Seibu Lions announced they would be willing to post their No. 1 pitcher this offseason, Kikuchi began sidestepping questions when asked what he himself wanted to do. But for years now, he had been preparing for this opportunity both on and off the field.

""He has been building up to this for several years now, with English lessons once a week,"" a source told Kyodo News recently on condition of anonymity. ""He would like to be the first Japanese player to make a speech (at his opening press conference) in English.""

Kikuchi also tried out a two-seam fastball this season, a somewhat rare sight in Japan but one that is considered a trademark of major league pitching. The two-seam sinking fastball has received a huge amount of publicity since 2017, when Japan's defeat in the World Baseball Classic was in part attributed to the pitch and the inability of its hitters to cope with it.

""He tried that out, but it was not a good pitch for him,"" the source said.

Kikuchi dropped another hint this past summer, when he told reporters at Zozo Marine Stadium on June 23, that he was consulting with analysts to sharpen up his mechanics. After years of concern about what he might be doing wrong, getting simple answers, he said, has been a load off his mind.

""I go back after every start and see the numbers,"" Kikuchi said. ""I have a sense of how well I did, but it's good to have the numbers to back that up.""

""Since I was in high school, I've tinkered with my mechanics. It's been a constant worry for me. Now with the data, I can tell if my release point is too far back or too far forward. I don't have to guess.""

""In the past I would try every possible position and fret over it. But if it's something I can understand (through the data), it's one less thing I need to worry about.""

Kikuchi's consultants, from Japan's Next Base Corp., started working with the 27-year-old this year using software that allows pitchers to see how their pitches appear to opposing batters and make adjustments accordingly.

The raw data his consultants use comes from TrackMan, a pitch tracking system that has only recently become widespread in Nippon Professional Baseball.

""He wanted to use the data to check his pitching form, for one thing and to sharpen his pitches so that they would be more effective in the majors,"" said Dr. Tsutomu Jinji, whose biomechanics research and experience working directly with professional pitchers underlies the company's product.

""Mr. Kikuchi throws three quarters, so he is often worried about whether his release point is too far toward first base (too low) or toward third base (too high).""

""He also wanted to make sure his hand position was correct so that he got more hop on his fastball.""

Despite all the work he had put in, when asked point blank about his plans on Oct. 21, hours after the Lion's season ended. Kikuchi had nothing to say.

""I haven't said anything to the team,"" he told reporters waiting for him at MetLife Dome. ""I'm not of a mind right now to consider what I might do going forward.""

Yet, ""I haven't thought about it"" is what nearly all Japanese players say when asked their thoughts about leaving their current club.

Later that night, a source revealed the pitcher would in fact ask the team to post him, although Kikuchi wouldn't come out and say that for nearly another week. It's all part of the standard game Japanese players go through before leaving for the majors.

But make no mistake, Kikuchi has been planning this move for years and is already as prepared as he can be for his next step."

Participatory governance is the need of the hour

The NITI Aayog's recently announced ""Strategy for New India@75"" has two chapters on the improvement of Indian cities: 'Smart Cities for Urban Transformation' and 'Modernising City Governance for Urban Transformation'. What is noteworthy is the lingering conceptual confusion between making Indian cities 'smart' and making them 'good and better governed' cities.

The chapter on smart cities says, ""Smart cities is an approach to urban development characterised by area-based development, efficient delivery of basic services in an equitable manner, and citizen's participation."" The chapter on governance says transformation of cities will require ""opportunities for all citizens"" and ""platforms for democratic participation"".

The emphasis in both chapters on equity, equal opportunities, and citizens' participation is very welcome because these are essential qualities of well-governed cities that satisfy the 'livelihoods' and 'liveability' requirements of all their citizens.

Riding on a global wave of technology's promise to improve the world, 'smartness' swept into the lexicon of India's urban transformation in 2014 when the NDA government took office. Since then, the limitations of technology to change fundamental social structures, and indeed its potential to aggravate fundamental problems, have become evident in the widespread disillusionment with social media.

Kentaro Toyama, professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information, launched Microsoft's research centre in Bangalore in 2004. He was involved with several technology projects to improve healthcare and education and reduce poverty. In his book, Greek Heresy: Rescuing Social Change from the Cult of Technology (2015), he explains that he learned in India that merely slathering technology onto complex social systems cannot improve outcomes.

Generally, social structures of systems must be changed to improve outcomes. When the first wave of technology-driven change swept through business enterprises in the 1990s, before the internet, businesses soon realised that business processes must be re-engineered before applying technology. That lesson is being learned again with the internet.

A city is a complex system. As is a modern airplane. Many systems working together, give an airplane its remarkable ability to carry tonnes of load in the air, safely, over long distances. Engines, navigational systems, steering systems, a strong and super-light body, and aerodynamic wings. All parts must work in harmony for the plane to fly.

A city has many complex systems too: for providing livelihoods, housing, transportation, urban utilities, recreation, safety, etc. All systems must cohere with each other to make a city 'world-class' from the perspective of its citizens.

A critical difference between airplanes and cities, both complex systems, is that one is an 'engineered' system, and the other is an 'organic' one. Engineered systems require an engineer to design them. Organic systems, such as all systems in nature, are 'self-adaptive'. They give shape to themselves through a dynamic process of interactions amongst their parts. Organic systems have the ability to redesign themselves while they are flying. (I explain further in my book, Redesigning the Airplane While Flying: Reforming Institutions, 2014.)

The distinction between complex engineered systems and complex self-adaptive systems points to where the capability (and motivation) of change in them resides. In an engineered system, it is outside the system. In a self-adaptive system, it is within it. Therefore, it is the strength of its internal system of self-governance that gives a city its resilience and abilities to adapt along with environmental changes and new technologies. A shift from technological smartness towards building platforms for democratic participation of citizens in the governance of their own cities is a move in the right direction.

Direct democracy whereby citizens can vote to indicate their preferences when complex matters must be resolved is an attractive idea. Digital mobile technologies can enable this. However, unless citizens are well-informed about what is at stake and the implications of their choice, and can understand different points-of-view, direct democracy results in confusion.

Brexit is an illustration of the painful complications that arise when people are asked to vote directly. The decision of the people that the British government is rushing headlong to implement represented the views of a narrow majority. And those who had voted in favour did not understand all the implications of what they were preferring.

A city is a 'commons' that must provide equitably for all its citizens. All citizens must have equal voice in the governance of the city. The Strategy for New India@75 emphasises that 'smart mechanisms' are required 'to enhance the voice of the poor, slum dwellers, migrants, and other underprivileged citizens' in determining the use of the city's land, about forms of transportation, and equitable provision of public services.

Digital technologies are good for carrying out 'smart' transactions between people and service providers, including government -- for making payments, enrolling for services, etc. They can enable automation of many services. However, digital transactions are not good for making collective decisions when many points of view must be considered to arrive at the best decision democratically.

Participative processes for democratic governance must adhere to some basic principles of inclusive, deliberative democracy, explains James Fishkin, professor of communication and political science at Stanford.

He has revisited the debates about democracy amongst the Greek philosophers as well as amongst the framers of the US Constitution. Moreover, he has researched recent experiences with digital decision-making in many countries -- in the US, in Scandinavian countries, and even in Chinese cities. He explains the architectural principles for a sound process for democratic decision-making, in his book, When the People Speak: Deliberative Democracy and Public Consultation (2011).

It has become fashionable to use the term 'smart' for everything. NITI Aayog recommends 'smart' command and control centres (ouch!), 'smart' area-based development (how?), 'smart' roads (where?), and 'smart' parks (what?) to improve India's cities.

Technology cannot substitute for good governance. Roads in Indian cities are frequently in need of repair. Processes for participative governance of Indian cities are also in need of repair urgently. Until they are fixed, technology cannot make Indian cities environmentally sustainable and inclusive.

Government officials and citizens must become digitally literate to become digitally smart. Much more, for better governance of our cities, government officials must learn to listen to citizens, especially the poorest, and all citizens must learn to listen to other citizens not like themselves."

In a two-storey building under a flyover in Bareilly, above namkeen shops, past a policeman posted in the stairwell, lives a 24-year-old woman with her parents, brother, two parrots and five Persian cats.

The oldest of the cats, Simba, with her furry golden coat, sauntered around the living room, while black-haired Mikey scampered. Mother and child, I asked. ""No, no, partners, just like Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas,"" the young woman giggled, her eyes sparkling, her long straight hair bouncing in a ponytail.

She might not have the international fame of film actor Chopra, who also grew up in Bareilly, but in this part of western Uttar Pradesh, everyone seems to know Nida Khan.

The young woman was catapulted to fame in 2016 when she filed a case against her husband, Sheeran Raza Khan, accusing him of beating her after she failed to meet his family's demands for dowry.

Sheeran Khan is no ordinary man: he is the scion of a powerful family of Islamic scholars who trace their lineage to Ahmed Raza Khan, the founder of the influential Barelvi school of Islam, which is followed by most Indian Muslims. They are the custodians of the Dargah-e-Ala Hazrat, the tomb of Ahmed Raza Khan. Sheeran Khan's uncle Tauqeer Raza Khan, a prominent cleric, also leads a political party called the Ittehad-e-Millat Council, and was a minister in the Samajwadi Party government.

When a rishta (marriage offer) came from the illustrious dargah family, Nida's mother was tempted. But her father, an officer in a public sector company, was clear: Nida had just passed out of St Francis High School, he wanted her to complete her graduation. Sheeran Khan's family had to wait.

The engagement took place in the summer of 2014, two months after Nida Khan finished a degree in commerce.

India had just witnessed a tumultuous election. Narendra Modi, the controversial chief minister of Gujarat led the Bharatiya Janata Party to a thumping victory. Under his watch, more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslim, had been killed in the 2002 Gujarat riots. This triggered deep anxieties among Muslims, who found their representation in the Lok Sabha plummet to an all time low.

As a woman on the path to marriage, Nida Khan was caught in her own maelstrom - she had just started to wear a burqa. All she remembers of the election is that she cast her vote for the first time. She voted in favour of the Congress candidate, not as a rejection of Modi, but because she was impressed with the strength of Indira Gandhi, India's only woman prime minister.

""I too was a leader in school,"" Khan said. ""First, as class monitor, then as school prefect.""

But when it came to marriage, Nida Khan followed tradition. In February 2015, when her nikah was solemnised to Sheeran Khan, she had not even seen his photograph.

Months later, in July, she was back at her parents home - with injuries serious enough to have caused a miscarriage.

""Our mentality did not match,"" she explained. ""Everyone assumed he is from the dargah family, he must be a hafiz, aalim [erudite person], but it turned out he was a Class 5 passout."" She got a taste of his anger in March, when he stormed into an examination hall where she was writing her first-year masters of commerce exams. Holding her by the arm, he pulled her out - a story dramatic enough for the local newspapers to publish, but after carefully excising all the names.

Such was the power of the dargah family that when Nida Khan decided to file a police complaint in 2016, she was initially turned away. She had to seek the intervention of the courts.

Even then the police hastily filed a final report exonerating Sheeran Khan, citing lack of evidence. On his part, he claimed the marriage itself was infructuous - he had dissolved it by saying ""talaq"" three times.

At this crucial juncture, Nida Khan's crusade caught the attention of the Bharatiya Janata Party, which, by then, had decided to raise the pitch against triple talaq. Launching the party's campaign for the 2017 assembly elections, Modi spoke of saving ""Muslim sisters"" from injustice. But many in the Muslim community saw this as an encroachment in their personal laws and another act of majoritarian assertion.

Already, western Uttar Pradesh had witnessed attacks on Muslims. In September 2015, a middle-aged man, Mohammed Akhlaq, was dragged out of his house and killed by a mob which claimed that he had slaughtered a calf for meat. The murder took place just 50 km away from Ghaziabad where Modi, during the 2014 election campaign, had thundered against India's rising beef exports, deriding them as ""gulabi kranti"" or a pink revolution.

Consolidating its 2014 victory, BJP swept the Uttar Pradesh elections in March 2017. For Muslims, the political marginalisation was now complete - not a single Muslim MLA in the ruling party and a rabble-rousing Hindu monk, Adityanath, in the chief minister's seat. One of his first orders was to clamp down on unauthorised slaughterhouses and meat shops, which mostly employ Muslims. While the shops reopened after complying with the new rules, meat became a bad word, leaving people in the business vulnerable.

Mohammad Salim Qureshi ran a meat shop in the narrow lanes of the old city of Bareilly. In June 2018, he was beaten to death in his own neighbourhood, allegedly by the henchmen of the police, after he failed to pay them bribes. ""They threatened to fix my brother in a cow slaughter case,"" said his brother Nayeem Qureshi.

Scroll.in spoke to a dozen Muslims living in and around Bareilly. Surrounded by other Muslims, they said they felt secure in their neighbourhoods, but travelling outside was a source of anxiety. A young rice miller said he had stopped taking trains to Delhi and now only journeyed by car: ""Because my wife wears a hijab,"" he explained. Others spoke of avoiding meat - in school tiffins, on journeys. ""No kebabs on the train,"" said a crafts merchant.

In this worsening social climate, the BJP has found one trump card: the triple talaq crusaders among Muslim women. Ishrat Jahan, a petitioner in the Supreme Court case that led to a ban on the practice, joined the party this year in West Bengal. So did Sofia Ahmed from Kanpur, who was rewarded with a post in the Uttar Pradesh minorities commission.

But Nida Khan is yet to join.

Her story offers glimpses of the complex fabric of life in western Uttar Pradesh, which is now under strain.

Bareilly district lies in northwestern Uttar Pradesh in a region called Rohilkhand, named after the Afghan Rohillas who ruled in the 17th century. The large Muslim population here - 34.54% in Bareilly and 50.57% in neighbouring Rampur - is often the subject of the feverish imaginations of Hindutva supporters.

For all the menace attributed to them, most Muslims here barely scrape through a living. The traditional occupations they follow are in a state of decline.

""Bareilly is famous for four things,"" a young man explained, ""baans, surma, manjha, zari"" - bamboo furniture, eye kohl, kite string and embroidery work.

All of them are losing out to cheaper, factory-made versions.

In 2014, while campaigning in Bareilly, Modi invoked the special connection he shared with the city as a Gujarati who loved flying kites. ""If your kite flies high, then the manjha must be from Bareilly,"" he said, sending the audience in raptures.

Referring to the downturn caused in the industry by cheaper nylon substitutes called Chinese manjha, he promised to turn around its fortunes, in the same way that he claimed his government had done with the kite industry in Gujarat. ""Brothers and sisters, in Gujarat, the kite industry is in the hands of the poor, 90% of whom are Muslims,"" he said. ""We did research and started schemes. The industry barely touched Rs 35 crore, we took it to Rs 500 crore.""

Among the audience was Arshad Hussain, the president of the Manjha Mazdoor Kalyan Samiti, which represents 30,000 workers in Bareilly district. Impressed with Modi's speech, he voted for the BJP in 2014, he recalled with nervous laughter one morning in December, sitting in a field in impoverished Bakarganj, where hundreds of men ran around poles in luminous winter light.

To make the kite-slaying manjha, the workers must injure their hands, coating the cotton thread strung on poles with a rice paste mixed with glass. The daily wages are a pittance - just Rs 150-Rs 200.

Far from seeing a revival under Modi government, this marginal industry has been pushed further against the wall. First, demonetisation in November 2016 caused an upheaval, then seven months later, the introduction of Goods and Services Tax came as a blow.

GST, which replaced a welter of other taxes, was supposed to make things easier. But not only are the costs of filing GST returns prohibitive, navigating paper work is a steep challenge for those who lack a formal education, said Hussain. ""About 200 people run majha-making units here,"" he said. ""Only 50 have a GST registration."" Others either sell their products by borrowing GST numbers [from other units], for which they pay a commission, or they sell them cheap to whoever is willing to buy.

A sales representative of a leading yarn-making company who was visiting Hussain in Bakarganj said he saw a downturn in every industry he did business with: shoe-making, textiles, mattresses. ""Cash flow has stopped in the economy,"" he said. As firms waited for refunds, GST had locked up private funds with the government, and banks were not lending. The result was a liquidity squeeze. ""The big players are benefitting, the smaller businesses are getting wiped out,"" he said.

In Shahmat Ganj in the old city, Asad Khan, 42, who makes and sells hand-embroidered salwar kameez fabrics pointed to a pile of products lying around. ""These have come back from Punjab,"" he said. He had sold them on credit - the buyer made no upfront payment - but when they remained unsold, the buyer sent them back. ""Now the trouble is I have already paid GST on them, which I won't get back,"" Khan said. The new tax system does not account for a traditional economy based on credit and trust.

It is easy to discuss the economic crisis in these neighbourhoods. But broaching the subject of the worsening social climate and the anxiety of being Muslim is not.

""I have stopped watching TV,"" is all that Asad Khan was willing to say.

Hammad Nabi, a youth leader of the Samajwadi Party, said it was counterproductive to dwell on the fears of Muslims: it pushes them to hardline leaders like the Owaisis, he claimed. ""This government is bad not just for Muslims, we say it is bad for everyone,"" he said.

But in the villages of Bareilly, there is disquiet. Zarar Ahmed, 60, the pradhan of Jojkharpur village in Bahedi block, and the head of the association of village chiefs, alleged that Muslim-majority villages were being denied development funds under the BJP. ""They have not sanctioned a single awaas [house] in my village,"" he said, referring to the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana, which subsidises the construction of low cost houses.

In another Muslim-majority village, Rurki, in the same block, a younger pradhan, Akram Khan, 43, disagreed. ""There might be verbal discrimination,"" he said, hinting at the sparring between BJP MLAs and pradhans owing allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, ""but there is no discrimination in funds.""

In his own village, however, stands a monument to the government's malice towards Muslims.

It is a two-storey building which lies incomplete. Funded through the previous government's multisectoral development programme, the building was meant to house an industrial training institute. The programme, which was launched in 2008, aimed at building infrastructure to ""address the development deficits of minority concentration areas"". The Centre contributed 75% of the funds, while 25% came from the state.

But, since the Modi government came to power, Uttar Pradesh officials say not only has the sanction of new projects stopped, even ongoing projects have come to a standstill because central funds have dried up. All that the Modi government has done is rename the programme as the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram.

For instance, of the Rs 3.65 crore allotted to the industrial training institute in Bahedi, Rs 2.65 was released by the previous government, all of which was spent. About 75% of the construction is complete. But the second instalment never came. Now, weeds have taken over the unfinished building.

In Bareilly district alone, as many as 24 projects are lying incomplete. The original sanction for them was Rs 52.73 crore but the delay has pushed up costs to Rs 77.56. To complete them, Uttar Pradesh would have to dip into its own funds, which, officials say, is unlikely to happen.

""Don't do anything for minorities, no issue,"" said a senior official. ""But this government wants to show it is not doing anything for them.""

Another example of Modi government's ill-will towards Muslims, said state officials, was the unprecedented delay in the salaries of teachers appointed under the madrassa modernisation scheme. Launched by the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led BJP government in 2003, the scheme aimed to supplement privately funded deeni talim (religious education) with government-funded duniyawi taleem (secular education) through the appointment of maths, science and other subject teachers.

While delays occurred even under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, never before had the Centre completely stopped releasing salaries. ""It's been 33 months since we were paid,"" said Mohammad Shakeel, who has been in service since 2003. ""We have agitated in Jantar Mantar [in Delhi], to no avail.""

""Modi ji says he wants Muslims to have ek haath mein computer, ek haath mein Koran [a computer in one hand, Koran in the other],"" he continued. ""Computer to mila nahi, ab Koran bhi chooth jayegi."" We did not get a computer, and now we stand to lose the Koran.

Funds are not the ony instrument by which governments signal their priorities.

Months after it came to power, in August 2017, the Adityanath government ordered all districts to enforce the singing of the national anthem in madrassas on Independence Day. The proceedings were to be recorded and the footage sent to Lucknow.

The decision created palpable tension in parts of Bareilly, said an official, leading to orders being imposed under Section 144 to prohibit more than four people from assembling at a spot.

Assigned the task of enforcing the order in one madrassa, he recalled how he got around it. ""I told them I will sing, you please join only if you want to,"" he said. ""Literally, no one sang. But I had positioned the camera in a way where only I was visible. So the work was done.""

In August, Nida Khan received a call from Rekha Arya, the women and child development minister of neighbouring Uttarakhand. Arya said she wanted to discuss women's issues but Khan was smart enough to know this was a cover. In July, a cleric in Bareilly had passed a fatwa against her, which had prompted the police to assign her a full-time security detail, but it had also raised her public profile. Aware that other triple talaq crusaders had joined the BJP, she anticipated an offer from the party.

When she consulted her parents, her father said ""no netagiri"", but her mother asked her to make up her own mind. Khan reminded herself that it was only after the BJP had come to power in Uttar Pradesh that the investigation in her case had been reopened. The police had taken one year to file the chargesheet. ""There was delay, but no injustice,"" she reasoned. ""I am safe as long as the BJP is in power. If the SP comes back, I am finished.""

But driving from Bareilly to Dehradun, via Haridwar, was a challenge.

It was the season for the Kanwar Yatra, in which young male devotees of Shiva walk long distances to fetch the water of Ganga from Haridwar. The road was jammed. ""My brother told the driver, be extra careful, if you even touch the bhole people, you will get killed,"" Khan recalled. A video had surfaced, showing Kanwariyas vandalising a car in the full public view, with the police watching helplessly.

In 2012, communal clashes had erupted in Bareilly district after Kanwariyas were stopped by Muslims from playing loud music in the town of Aonla. This year, in many villages of Bareilly, Muslims complained that Kanwariyas deliberately strayed from the official routes, marched in front of mosques, resorted to provocative slogans. ""Musalman khamosh raha (Muslims stayed silent),"" said Abdul Waheed, a leader allied to the Samajwadi Party. ""We counselled them to stay silent. If you speak up, you only will get beaten up. The government is theirs.""

But Nida Khan scoffed at the simplistic binaries. ""Our people too take out jaloos [processions] which are nothing but shakti pradarshan [displays of strength],"" she noted. The competitive displays clashed in 2010, when a procession to mark the Prophet's birthday ran into a Holi celebration in Bareilly. This triggered riots that led to a month-long curfew in the city.

Voicing a commonly held belief, Nida Khan claimed the riots were not spontaneous: the clash was orchestrated. Less than a year ago, in 2009, Santosh Gangwar of the BJP, after six successive wins, was defeated by the Congress in the Lok Sabha elections. The Bahujan Samaj Party was in power in the state. Both the Samajwadi Party and the BJP were political marginalised. Nida Khan claims they got together to engineer the riots and polarise the electorate. ""Tauqeer Mian [of the dargah family] and Santosh Gangwar are after all good friends,"" she said.

This year, in the thick of speculation over whether Khan would join the BJP, local newspapers reported that Gangwar had scuttled her chances - at the behest of the dargah family. While Arya had made an offer on behalf of BJP's Uttarakhand unit, Nida Khan had turned it down, saying she would also consider an offer from the central leadership. Days later, Gangwar called her for a meeting, but nothing came of it.

Nida Khan remains ambivalent about joining the BJP.

In September, she had travelled to Lucknow to collect an award. Adityanath was the chief guest at the event. On stage, the moderator asked him about the mob lynchings in the state - as recently as June, a Muslim man had been killed over cow slaughter rumours in Hapur.

Khan recalled his answer: ""Mob lynching? No, that's not taking place in UP"".

""I was like how much is he lying,"" she said. ""But the anchor did not even cross-question him.""

In the Bareilly college, where Nida Khan studied, colonial-era red brick buildings are set against green expansive lawns. Like many campuses, in recent years, it has seen a rise of the Hindutva student organisation, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad. In October, a bus carrying Urdu books sponsored by the National Council For Promotion of Urdu Language, an autonomous body under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, had to be sent back after ABVP objected, shouting slogans against it.

Even without paying much attention to politics, two young women in the second-year BSc course had concluded that Modi government was anti-Muslim. ""Everything is being renamed,"" said Rashmi Singh, 19. Her friend, Alqama Zaidi, 17, chipped in: ""Did you see the WhatsApp joke about Hajmola?"" - referring to a brand of candy. ""The government has renamed it, because it has Haj and Moula. Its new name is Deen Dayal Upadhyay."""

Around 4.30 am on Wednesday, a team from the National Investigation Agency knocked on Mohammad Azam's door in Jaffrabad, a Muslim-dominated locality in north-east Delhi. His wife and five-year-old daughter were still asleep. Over the next seven hours, the team searched Azam's home, interrogated him and eventually arrested him. Officials claim that Azam is the ""mastermind in arranging weapons"" for Harkat-Ul-Harb-e-Islam, a group inspired by the Islamic State that was allegedly planning to bomb key targets.

As Azam was being questioned, officials from the agency were conducting similar operations in at least five other homes in Jaffrabad. At the end of the day, agency officials said they had conducted search operations in at least 16 places in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh. They said they had arrested 10 people and detained six others for interrogation.

The group was at an ""advanced stage"" in planning bomb attacks on vital installations, security personnel, political figures and crowded places, the National Investigation Agency said. The group is thought to have approximately 20 members.

They intended to use remote-controlled bombs but were also planning a fidayeen suicide attack in case it was necessary, said the agency. The group was largely self-funded, and some of the accused men had bought material after allegedly selling gold they had stolen from home. They used messaging applications such as WhatsApp and Telegram for their internal communications, the agency claimed.

A country-made rocket launcher, 150 rounds of ammunition and 25 kg of an explosive paste of potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, sugar and sulphur were recovered during the raids, said Inspector General (NIA) Alok Mittal. Investigators also seized Rs 7.5 lakh in cash, nearly 100 mobile phones, 135 SIM cards, several laptops and memory cards during the raids. Several batteries and 120 alarm clocks that could be used for making bombs were also found, he said.

The alleged mastermind of the plan, Mohammad Azam, 35, owns a pharmaceutical shop in Jaffrabad. As the raid on his home began, officials confiscated his mobile phone and also his wife's. But one of his relatives heading for the mosque noticed the police vehicles outside the home and the officers standing guard at the entrance. She alerted other family members about the raid, said Mohammad Naved, Azam's nephew.

At around 9 am, the officers opened his shop and searched it too. Azam is the youngest of five brothers, who are engaged in business ranging from pharmaceuticals to garments and scrap dealing in Delhi. According to Naved and Mohammad Nazeem, one of Azam's employees, the officers took away some documents and two mobile phones from Azam's home.

Also raided in Jaffrabad was the home of Mohammad Ubaid, whose brother Mohammad Suhail, 29, was arrested in Uttar Pradesh's Amroha, where he resides with his wife and teaches in a madrassa. The agency claimed that Suhail was a mufti who had ""tasked other team members to procure arms, explosives and other accessories to prepare IEDs [improvised explosive device] and pipe bombs"".

But his elder brother Mohammad Ubaid, refused to accept this contention. ""He has always been a peaceful person and that is why he chose to be a teacher in the first place,"" said Ubaid. Agency officials arrived at Ubaid's home around 4.30 am and started a search, relatives said. They confiscated mobile phones and SIM cards of all relatives.

Suhail, his relatives said, had got married last year and moved to Amroha around two months ago. He lives there with members of his extended family. Till early 2018, he was a teacher at a madrassa in north-east Delhi. His family owns a battery and inverter shop, which was also raided on Wednesday. The police took away some equipment from the shop which Ubaid and his cousin Akram said they could not clearly identify.

The family currently is more concerned about Suhail's father Mohammed Hafeez, who has a motor disability caused by a neurological disorder and went into shock after Wednesday's raid.

In lane number 24 of Jaffrabad, the gates of the home of Anas Yunus, a civil engineering student at a private university in Noida, were locked for around 12 hours as investigators interrogated the 24-year-old in the presence of his relatives. Around 5.30 pm, one of the iron gates was opened. Some police officers rushed out of the three-storeyed house with a man whose face was covered with a muffler. Yunus was shoved into a police jeep, which sped away as some reporters chased it till the end of the congested lane.

The agency has accused Yunus of being ""instrumental in procuring electrical items, alarm clocks, batteries, etc in furtherance of their terror conspiracy"". The engineering student's father, Mohammad Yunus, specialises in fancy plaster designs and works with building contractors in the city, said his neighbours. They said they had not known Yusuf to be religious, and were sceptical about the accusations that he was a member of a terror group.

Also arrested were two brothers, Zubaid Malik and Zaid Malik. Zubaid, 20, is a student of humanities at the University of Delhi. His brother, Zaid, 22, helps their father in his air cooler shop. Teams of police and NIA officials had arrived in their home at around 4.30 am, and after a search took away the mobile phone and SIM cards of all family members. They also too away some books belonging to Zubaid and Zaid, said a relative who asked to remain anonymous. He could not recall the title of the books.

The agency has accused both the brothers of being ""instrumental in procuring batteries, connectors, SIM cards on fake documents and mobilising funds for buying bomb making materials"".

The sixth man arrested from Delhi, identified as Rashid Zafar Raq, 22, owns a small garment shop on the Jaffrabad. Officers arrived at his home around 5 am and interrogated him for more than 14 hours, said Shehnaaz Begum, his mother. All his relatives were summoned by the police, who conducted a search operation in their presence.

Raq is the youngest of three brothers. While the eldest also works in the garments business too, the other is a physiotherapist who has recently returned from Japan where he had gone for a business trip in connection with sale and purchase of some physiotherapy-related products, the relatives said.

Mohammad Ameer, a school friend, said that though Raq never went to college, he is a sharp businessman. This, said Ameer, is why Raq was able to move from running a street garment business to starting a permanent shop around six months ago.

Raq's relatives said that they had no inkling about the plot the police claimed the young man was involved in until he was taken away by the police in late evening. The agency did not specifically elaborate on Raq's alleged role in the terror module.

The four other persons arrested in connection with the case are from Unnao, Amroha and Hapur districts of Western Uttar Pradesh. The other persons being interrogated are believed to be residents of Amroha, Lucknow and Meerut districts.

As the operation was underway, the anxiety was palpable in Jaffrabad, the site of a major garments market, where most shops deal in artificial leather products. The area has a population of around 60,000, of whom 70% are Muslim. Several residents accused the government targetting their neighbours because of their religion.

Relatives of all six men arrested in Jaffrabad claimed that the accusations were untrue. At least three of the men sported beards, they said. These identity markers, the relatives claimed, were used by the security agencies to target their relatives.

Earlier this month, the National Investigation Agency claimed to have broken up a Tamil Nadu module of ISIS. For the past two years, the agency has been conducting crackdowns on ISIS-inspired groups in Jammu and Kashmir. The agency has been investigating cases in Kerala too. So far, Delhi has not been linked with any of them."

Beginning next Kharif season, the Union Agriculture Ministry will roll out a nation-wide, agri market intelligence system with the objective of helping farmers secure better price by forecasting demand for major foodgrains and price-sensitive horticulture crops such as onions, The Hindu Business Line has reported.

A forecasting system well ahead of the production season can enable the farmers to undertake an informed decision on their production with a view to earning optimal returns. The forecasting system is also expected to help other stakeholders in the agri-supply system including traders, processors, exporters, importers.

Quoting an official in the Agriculture Ministry, The Hindu Business Line report said that the proposed system will be exactly modelled on the seasonal weather forecasting system of India Meterological Department's (IMD). Regular forecasts will be issued on a fortnightly basis during the sowing season through the system and the initial scope will include foodgrains -- which cover 72 per cent of total cropped area in the country and horticulture crops such as potatoes, onions and tomatoes.

Setting up a system for forecasting price and demand for agricultural commodities is based on the recommendations made by an expert panel on doubling farmers' income, headed by Ashok Dalwai, who is also the CEO of National Rainfed Area Authority (NRAA). The Dalwai Committee, set up in April 2016, has submitted a14 -volume report identifying ways to double farmers' 2015-16 income level, in real terms, by 2022.

The Dalwai committe had observed that over the years, though the government has developed an elaborate system of estimation of crop sown area, yield and production of different crops, quality and timeliness of the data poses a big challenge in precise and error free forecasting and projections. It also pointed out that despite multiple organisations involved in compilation, monitoring and release of prices/price indices, currently no department is involved in forecasting prices/demand officially at the national level. The committe had recommended restructuring of Directorate of Marketing Inspection into the Directorate of Marketing Intelligence to help provide a solution at national level for reliable and timely price forecasting in a sustainable way. The committee also recommended that focus should be on monitoring demand and supply situations to arrive at associated price forecast.

The Dalwai commitee had underscored the need for designing a multivariate forecasting system for price of an agriculture commodity using a dynamic model that, in addition to historical prices, incorporates all possible explanatory factors including yield, rainfall, temperature, stocks, trade (imports and exports), unforeseen factors like political uncertainty, strikes, etc., that influence future price and production of a commodity.

In October this year, the Agriculture Ministry constituted a technical advisory committee (TAC), again under the chairmanship of Dalwai.

According to The Hindu Business Line report, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR-NIAP) has been identified as knowledge partner for the project to begin with. The TAC, from time to time, would recommend commodities on which price and demand forecasting needs to be made by ICAR-NIAP. The TAC is likely to sign a memorandum of understanding with some agricultural universities in the country and also set up centres in different places so that regional forecasts can be made.

The Dalwai Committe report also showcased few success stories in building a price forecasting system for agricultural commodities.

In 2015-16 in Karnataka, with financial assistance from Karnataka State Agriculture Marketing Board, three agriculture universities located at Bengaluru, Dharwad and Raichur were assigned the project of developing a price forecasting system using rigorous time series econometric models for select commodities including paddy, sorghum, maize and ragi under cereals; bengal gram, red gram, green gram and black gram under pulses; groundnut, sunflower and soybean under oilseeds; dry chillies, cotton, coconut, arecanut and turmeric under commercial crops; and tomato, potato and onion under vegetable crops.

Apart from forecasting, traders' survey, consideration of future market prices, changes in the government policies, weather changes, import and export situation, prices of competitive commodities and a shift in the crop area at district, state and country levels were considered for building the model.

The government of Karnataka also constituted the Karnataka Agriculture Prices Commission (KAPC) as an advisory body to deal with aspects of scientific costing and pricing of farm produces, competitive market structure and all other issues related to farmers' income and welfare in the state.

In order to accomplish the major mandate of timely dissemination of market intelligence and information to policy makers as well as to farmers, a project was assigned to School of Food Business, Diary Sciences College, Hebbal Campus, Bengaluru, falling under Veterinary University (KVAFSU) Bider, to construct an Interactive Dashboard for real-time prices forecast for principle agriculture and horticultural commodities. Accordingly, the dashboard was designed and developed as a 'Decision Support System (DSS)' with the active support a Bengaluru-based software company."
"129","1027495832","2018-12-27","https://beebom.com/best-multiplayer-games-for-iphone/","18 Best Multiplayer Games For iPhone in 2019 (Free and Paid)","Beebom",FALSE,"Most iPhone games are meant for a single player, which is fine when you just want to kill a few minutes while you're waiting in line. But sometimes you want a more significant gaming experience where you can take on your friends, whether they're at your house or in a different country. Fortunately, there are a number of great multiplayer games that you can get on your iPhone, from first-person shooters to battle royale to causal racing games. Here are 18 of the best multiplayer games for iPhone to get you started!

Let's start off the list with some casual games. These are the kind of games you can play in your free time without having to put too much effort on them.

Miniclip's 8 Ball Pool is, without a doubt, one of the best multiplayer games for your iPhone. I was introduced to this particular game when I was in high school, and I've been recommending it to everyone since then. 8 Ball Pool has a simple yet attractive interface that makes it easy to play.

Although there's an option to play 8 Ball Pool with a guest account, I highly recommend signing via Facebook or Miniclip account to enjoy all the multiplayer features. You can either play a 1v1 game or challenge your Facebook or 8 Ball Pool friends for a match. Heck, you can even play an 8-player tournament to claim your spot in the leaderboards. Every time you start a new match, you burn some coins and place your bet. The winner, of course, walks away with all the coins.

If you ever run out of coins to play, you can choose to pick up some coins from the in-game store in exchange for money. You can also use the coins to get cosmetic upgrades, power-ups and more. 8 Ball Pool is available as a free title on the App Store, and I highly recommend you check it out.

Bowmasters is a turn-based game in which you and your opponent will take turns firing arrows at each other. You'll be standing across a stage in varying distances, and your objective is to accurately hit your enemy. Depending on the distance, you'll have to measure the power and angle of your shot to hit your opponent. I know it sounds like a lot of work, but trust me, you'll get a hang of the controls in no time.

Much like its single-player mode, Bowmasters' multiplayer mode is also a lot of fun. It is, however, worth pointing out that the multiplayer mode isn't accessible from the start. You'll have to unlock it by getting 10 wins against the AI, which also doubles up as your training period. The game offers both online and a local multiplayer mode.

You can choose to splurge on in-app purchases for both cosmetic and character upgrades, but that's entirely optional. You can easily collect the necessary amount of coins and gems by winning battles or watching video ads from time-to-time. Bowmasters is available as a free-to-play game on the App Store, and it is indeed one of the best multiplayer games you can add to your library this year.

I've always had a special place for games with stick figures, and Super Stickman Golf 3 is one of my favorites. Super Stickman Golf 3 is the latest in the long-running Stickman series for iPhone, and as the name suggests, it is a golfing game at its heart. Your objective is to get the ball in the hole. From 'Long Hit Iron' shots to a simple golf drill, you can truly put your golfing skills to work in this game.

The gameplay, in case you are wondering, is fairly simple. I love how there's no tutorial in this game, and it lets you dive into the game right away. Yes, you can choose to play the single-player mode right away and get started with the game. However, I highly recommend you go for the multiplayer mode as there are two distinct game elements. There's a race mode in which you and your opponent will race to shoot the ball into the hole as fast as possible, and a 'Turn-based' mode, in which you compete against the opponent in a battle that focuses on the score. I personally prefer playing the race mode, because of its competitive nature, but you can't go wrong either way. The game also offers in-app purchases, however, they're completely optional. Overall, Super Stickman Golf 3, in my opinion, is one of the best online multiplayer games you can play on your iPhone. It's an easy-to-play title that offers pretty much everything you could want from a casual game.

If you want to get a taste of some intense multiplayer gaming experience, then you've got to play some MOBA titles. Here are a couple of my favorite titles in this category -

You may have heard of Arena of Valor in the past, as it is one of the most popular MOBA titles of all times. The upgraded version of the game offers 5v5 combat mode in classic MOBA style, which means your objective is to take down enemy towers. Yes, it's as good as a MOBA would get on a smartphone.

Arena of Valor features over 40 heroes and a bunch of game modes to choose from. In addition to the 5V5 mode, you can also choose to play 1v1 or 3v3 mode. Each match lasts around 10 minutes, so it's easy to sneak in a game or two between your work. The game also has precision controls, and if you've ever played MOBA titles before, then you'll definitely feel at home with this one. Arena of Valor weighs 1.3GB in size, and it is compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch running iOS 8.0 or later.

Vainglory is a top-tier, action-packed MOBA title. Thanks to its popularity, it is currently the number one MOBA title on the App Store. Be it casual, ranked or BRAWL modes, Vainglory has the perfect gameplay style for you. You also get to choose from 37+ playable heroes and unlock skins for them.

My personal favorite feature of Vainglory is its in-game Guild finder, which makes it easier for me to find a game anytime I want. It also has support for Joystick controls and 120FPS, which means you are in for an ultimate MOBA experience on a smartphone. Vainglory weighs 2GB in size, and it is compatible with iPhone XS, X, 8 Plus, iPad, and iPod touch running on iOS 8.0 or above.

AdventureQuest 3D is a relatively new game in the MMORPG space, however, I truly believe that it is worth checking out. At the heart of it, AdventureQuest 3D includes all the elements that a mobile MMORPG title would normally have. I am talking about different game modes like co-op and PvP modes with cross-platform support. You can also create your unique hero and go head-to-head with some of the best MMORPG villains and monsters.

I also love AdventureQuest 3D's Parkour challenge maps. If that's not your thing, then you can also transform into birds, dragons, and more. Needless to say, the game also offers some interesting modes in which you can raid dungeons or take on boss fight challenges. Despite being a freemium title, AdventureQuest 3D has a lot going for it. The cross-platform support is truly the highlight feature here for me. It weighs only 130MB in size, and it is compatible with iPhone, iPads, and iPod Touch running on iOS 8.0 and above.

Order & Chaos Online is one of the most acclaimed MMORPG titles that are available on iOS. The game will take you on an adventure ride with magical creatures in dark forests. You can choose to be a part of one of the five races, and you'll find yourself discovering thousands of skills and equipment throughout your journey.

Order & Chaos Online is popularly known for its online community, in which you can interact with friends and even your enemies. You can also trade or challenge each other, which opens up a ton of opportunities in-game. If you're planning to play this though, then PvP battlefield areas are the place to be. It's a simple game mode in which you try to capture the opposing team's flag and bring it back to your base to score. Sounds awesome, right? Well, that's just a part of the fun, and there are a ton of other things to be explored in this game like quests, dungeons, and more.

If you're not into MOBA and MMORPG games, then I've got a couple of strategy games for you as well. Let's check them out -

You may have heard of Clash of Clans before. Well, if you have, then you've got to introduce yourself to Clash Royale as well. Clash Royale is a card-based strategy game that's inspired from Clash of Clans. It is all about collecting and upgrading your cards featuring troops, spells, and heroes from Clash of Clans.

The best part of Clash Royale is the ability to build your own battle community. Yes, you can build your own community and fight enemies to bring their clans down. Clash Royale is all about teamwork, which makes it one of the best multiplayer games you can add to your library. However, if you like to play as a one-man army, then you can also challenge your friends for a private duel, which is equally fun.

Star Wars: Force Arena is one of those games that combines the most popular trends in the gaming world into one all-around strategy game. Playing Star Wars: Force Arena makes me feel like I am playing both Clash Royale and Vainglory at the same time. Well, that's because this new Star Wars game has borrowed game elements from each of those games.

In Star Wars: Force Arena, you get to lead your own customized squad and get involved in action-packed gameplay. The game also has really good graphics, pushing the iPhone to its limits. I also love the game's intuitive touch controls as it delivers an ultimate gaming experience. This is a no-brainer for all the Star Wars fans, especially if you liked the latest entry into the franchise, Rogue One.

Hearthstone is Blizzard's award-winning card battler. The game, just like any other card-based strategy games, lets you collect cards and use them to cast spells and control the battlefield. You can choose to play a solo mode against AI heroes, however, you'll have to dive into 1v1 matches against other players online to experience the game to its fullest potential.

Building your deck and honing your skills may seem like a lot of work at first. But once you do that and get started with the battles, there's hardly anything that's going to stop you. I've spent countless hours in this game, and I can confidently say that Hearthstone is indeed one of the best multiplayer games out there. It's also a free-to-play title, so be sure to check it out.

Apple's App Store is filled with a ton of awesome racing games, but here are a couple of my favorite ones, which I think deserves a place in your library of games -

The Asphalt series has some of the best racing games on mobile phones, and Asphalt 9 Legends is no exception. In fact, it's probably the best among the Asphalt games, in my opinion. In addition to career mode, the game also features a ton of unique challenges and limited time events that are a lot of fun to play.

It is also worth pointing out that Asphalt 9 Legends has a great vehicle selection, probably one of the best among all the smartphone racing games out there. Couple that with a robust online multiplayer mode, and you have a winner right here. The highlight of the game for me is the new 'Touch Drive' button controls. It makes the game feel a lot better in comparison to other Asphalt games in the series.

If you are not into cars, then you must check out Riptide GP: Renegade. As a part of Riptide series, this game lets you ride wave runners instead of cars, and it's indeed a lot of fun. The game also has gorgeous graphics and unique mechanics that make up for a fun-filled gameplay experience.

Riptide GP: Renegade's online multiplayer mode is very underrated in my opinion. It lets you put your skills to test against opponents from around the world in 8-player online matches. It gets really intense as you'll be called out for death-defying stunts over massive waterfalls, public waterways, and more. Riptide GP: Renegade is a paid title, however, it's definitely the best action-arcade water racer out there, and I highly recommend you give it a shot.

Regardless of the number of games you have on your phone, a game library is always incomplete without some sports games. So here are a couple of multiplayer sports games that are worth checking out -

Electronic Arts needs no introduction when it comes to sports games, does it? The studio is known for some of the best sports titles on the market, with FIFA being on the top. FIFA on the App Store offers the most authentic football experience on iOS. The game features hundreds of licensed teams with thousands of players online.

FIFA Football's real-time PvP mode will put you in a head-to-head battle against the opponents from around the globe. The game also lets you create your own team, and you can build your roster with players from over 550 real teams. Heck, you can even tweak tactics of each player before every match. Be it League vs League tournaments or inter-league championships, FIFA Football has a game mode for everyone.

If you are someone who doesn't like EA's FIFA, then you may also want to try Konami's Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) 2019 (Free).

BOOMSHAKALAKA! NBA JAM has known to be one of the most popular sports game since the early '90s, so I had to add this game to the list of best multiplayer games for iPhone. The game lets you jam with all 30 NBA teams and your favorite NBA stars. You can unlock some legendary players like Scottie Pippen, Detlef Schrempf, Dennis Rodman, and more.

Although NBA JAM only has a local multiplayer mode, I highly recommend you give it a shot. You can also unlock outrageous cheats and go against a friend for a classic arcade battle. The game also offers two different control schemes like D-Pad or Gesture-based controls. I personally prefer D-Pad controls, as it gives me the classic arcade vibes, but it's great that you get the option to choose your own playing style. You should definitely check out NBA JAM.

Minecraft is one of the first games that I started my PC gaming journey with, so I had to add it to this list. The mobile version of the game, unlike other mobile ports, is basically the same as the desktop and console versions. In fact, you can play Minecraft even on servers with people who are playing the game on PC and consoles.

If you've never heard of Minecraft before, it is a sandbox game where you mine items, destroy them and put on your creative hat. The game, as you can see, has 8-bit graphics, however, that's the Minecraft that I've come to like. So, no complaints there.

Minecraft also lets you create your own Minecraft Realms, which are your own always-online Minecraft world. You will, however, have to get a monthly subscription, the prices for which depends on the number of people you want to invite to play in your realm simultaneously.

Action Games and multiplayer titles are like bread and butter, so there's no way I was going to end the list without recommending a few. Here are three action-packed multiplayer games which I think are absolutely worth playing -

As I had mentioned earlier, PUBG Mobile has become a household name when it comes to multiplayer games. The game now has a strong community with millions of players across the globe. Each PUBG Mobile game match starts off in a plane from which you are dropped on an island with up to 99 other players.

Your goal is to collect weapons and other supplies, kill the rest of the players and be the last man standing. You do all that while making sure that you are inside the play area. Well, I've been playing PUBG Mobile since the day it arrived, and I can confidently say that you'll have a great time battling it out for that Chicken Dinner!

If we are talking about PUBG Mobile, there's no way we can miss out on its fiercest rival Fortnite. Well, it certainly has taken the game industry by storm and has now become a worldwide phenomenon. It's an excellent title, where the basics remain the same as any other battle royale game, but the gameplay here is cartoonish and fun in comparison to PUBG Mobile's real-life vibe.

It's not the quirky gameplay that makes Fortnite so much fun, to be honest, but instead the building element that makes fights more interesting. I've been playing Fortnite since it first landed on iOS earlier this year and the game has managed to keep me glued with its interesting stories, outfits, emotes, and all the seasons.

Modern Combat games have always been considered to be the Call of Duty equivalent games for mobile phones. Thanks to the fast-paced gameplay, I am a huge fan of the Modern Combat series myself. And much like the previous Modern Combat titles, the new Modern Combat 5 is also equally good if not any better.

The best part of the game is that it lets you choose between 9 customizable classes that you can level up across single and multiplayer modes. You can also activate class-specific skills by burning your skill points.

The multiplayer mode of Modern Combat 5, in particular, is spectacular. I find myself coming back to this game just for its epic team clashes. If you are not into those, you can also put your name in the leaderboard by taking on players individually (player vs. squad). The game also offers highly customizable and intuitive controls, making it easier to go on a killing spree.

Well, that ends our list of the best multiplayer games for iPhone. PUBG Mobile, Minecraft, and 8 Ball Pool are some of my favorite games, which I've been playing for a long time. If you think I missed your favorite title, then be sure to drop a comment down below, and I'll check it out myself."

The UN recognised the Prime Minister in the Policy Leadership category for his bold environmental leadership on the global stage. His pioneering work in championing the International Solar Alliance where the country heralded a global coalition of nations to tackle climate change by leveraging the power of solar energy which has been lauded globally. Some of the major highlights of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in the year 2018 are outlined below:-

World Environment Day:

Considering India's global leadership in environmental protection and climate change sectors, the UNEP had chosen India to be the global host for World Environment Day (WED) on 5 June, 2018.

The main event was organized in Delhi and included a series of conferences in Vigyan Bhawan, a mega exhibition in Rajpath Lawns behind Vigyan Bhawan and the concluding event was graced by the Hon'ble Prime Minister and dignitaries from UN also attended the event. This WED, 2018 focused on ""Plastic Pollution"" which is one of the most challenging environmental concerns today.

Green Good Deeds Campaign:

Green Good Deeds, the societal movement launched by the Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Dr Harsh Vardhan to protect environment and promote good living in the country, has earned worldwide accolades.

""Green Good Deeds"" is an idea to take environmental awareness to the people and get them involved. Formally launched in January 2018, the campaign lauds small positive actions performed by individuals or organisations to strengthen the cause of environmental protection. The Ministry has drawn up a list of over 600 Green Good Deeds and asked people to alter their behaviour to Green Good Behaviour to fulfill their Green Social Responsibility. These small, positive actions, to be performed by individuals or organisation to strengthen the cause of environmental protection have been enlisted on a mobile App called Dr Harsh Vardhan App.

Students under Eco-clubs are implementing the Green Good Deeds (GGDs) initiative which seeks to transform the people's behaviour into Green Good Behaviour and fulfil Green Social Responsibility. A ten point agenda has been developed to implement the GGDs through Nodal agencies in State/UTs implementing the Ecoclub programme. Various activities covered under GGDs like cleanliness drives within the school campus, carry out waste segregation into biodegradable and non-biodegradable, paper re-cycling and conducting tree plantation drives etc are being implemented across the country by the students. The green attitude is visible in their actions. Further GREEN GOOD DEEDS event was successfully organised on 6.10.2018 at India International Science Festival (IISF) 2018 held at Indira Gandhi Prathishthan, Lucknow. Event was inaugurated by Dr. A.K. Mehta Additional Secretary, MoEFCC. Exhibition showcasing the success stories under Ecoclub programme. Around 200 Ecoclub students from Uttar Pradesh participated in the Drawing and Essay competitions.

In order to skill youth in environment, forest and wildlife sectors and enable them to be gainfully employed/ self-employed, MoEF&CC launched a Green Skill Development Programme (GSDP) in June, 2017 on a pilot basis. The programme is now being scaled to an all India level. More than 30 skilling programmes are being conducted during 2018-19, covering diverse fields-pollution monitoring (air/ water/ soil), STP/ETP/CETP operation, waste management, forest management, water budgeting & auditing, conservation of river dolphins, wildlife management, para taxonomy, including PBRs, mangroves conservation, bamboo management and livelihood generation.

During 2018-19 from August till date, 944 candidates have successfully completed the different skilling courses. Currently, 568 candidates are enrolled in various ongoing courses. The objective of creating a pool of Master Trainers during 2018-19 is also being met as 283 of the successful trainees have offered to be Master Trainers, who would skill more youth across the country in various skill sets, related to environment, forest and wildlife. A mobile app giving information about the training programme being conducted under GSDP, list of the Institutes offering these programme and other details has been also launched.

Reclassification of Bamboo & Removal from Category of Tree:

The Government of India has made concerted efforts to promote bamboo cultivation right from enabling regulatory provision, to supporting the bamboo plantation on a large scale by launching newly restructured National Bamboo Mission with a budget outlay of Rs 1290 crore.

The amendment in Indian Forest Act, 1927, will facilitate the inter-state movement of bamboo, as there will be no requirement of permit during transit from one State to another. It will ultimately result in reducing the gap of availability of resources from bamboo-surplus states to bamboo-deficit states. As a result, both producers and consumers will be benefitted.

The Climate Change Division of Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) looks after the issues related to climate change including the international negotiations and domestic policies and actions. India is a Party to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Paris Agreement and Kyoto Protocol. The Division is also responsible for submission of National Communications (NATCOMs) and the Biennial Update Reports (BURs) to UNFCCC. Several domestic programmes/ schemes have been initiated in the recent years for addressing climate change. Some key initiatives include the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) and State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) among others. In order to create and strengthen the scientific and analytical capacity for assessment of climate change in the country, different studies have also been initiated under CCAP.

During the year 2018, many important bilateral and multilateral meetings and negotiations on climate change were held in the run up to the 24 Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC (COP-24), in which Hon'ble Minister, EF&CC and senior officials of the Ministry participated. The Ministry hosted international meetings of the Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) on 1 and 2 November 2018 and BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India and China) countries on 19 -20 November 2018. The meeting has helped in strengthening and securing common interest and positions of the developing countries in the run up to COP-24 to the UNFCCC.

Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP-24) in Katowice, Poland was successful in adopting Paris Agreement Work Programme. The conference was significant one which focused on other key issues including the conclusion of 2018 Facilitative Talanoa Dialogue and the stocktake of Pre-2020 actions implementation and ambition. India engaged positively and constructively in all the negotiations while protecting India's key interests including recognition of different starting points of developed and developing countries; flexibilities for developing countries and consideration of principles including equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). India re-affirmed its commitment to multilateralism and international cooperation and its image has undergone a positive change

An India Pavilion was also setup during Twenty Fourth Conference of Parties (COP 24) of UNFCCC held in Katowice, Poland from December 3 to 14, 2018. The theme of pavilion this year was 'One World One Sun One Grid' based on an ambitious target set by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi during the first assembly of the International Solar Alliance on October 2018 that 40 percent of its installed power capacity will be from non-fossil fuels by 2030. Eminent dignitaries from the other participating countries of Japan, Qatar, Austria, Maldives, UK and the host country Poland visited the India Pavilion and gave remarkable feedback. The India Pavilion also became a platform to bring together 43 different stakeholder institutions including Central Ministries, State Governments/ Departments, Think Tanks, Civil Society Organisations, etc. to showcase their climate change action taken in various sectors through 20 side events. A footfall of about 14-15,000 people at India pavilion during the course of COP-24.

In 2018, under National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change (NAFCC), a total amount of Rs. 42.16 crore has been released to seven (07) ongoing projects to support adaptation activities in Rajasthan, Sikkim, H.P., Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Manipur and Kerala. Till date 27 projects (including one regional project) have been approved at a total cost of Rs. 673.63 crore and Rs. 369 crore have been sanctioned.

Under Climate Change Action Programme (CCAP) scheme, a total amount of Rs. 2.15 crore has been released for capacity building in Madhya Pradesh, Nagaland, Telangana and two demonstration projects in Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh respectively. Ministry is also implementing two scientific programmes under CCAP namely, National Carbonaceous Aerosols Programme (NCAP) and Long Term Ecological Observatories (LTEO).

India will be submitting its Second Biennial Update Report (BUR) to UNFCCC in late December 2018 to comply with the reporting obligations under the convention. The report among others, contains information on the national GHG inventory for the year 2014.

Some Other important Initiatives/Policy decisions during - 2018

Vide the notification dated 6 April, 2018 a six-month opportunity for all mining project which were granted EC under the EIA Notification 1994 but not obtained EC for expansion/ modernization/amendment given in the light of order passed by Hon'ble Supreme Court."

Sounds too good to be true? Not with Learning Yogi's 'Atlas Mission', an epic story-driven and game-based learning platform that helps children across different socio-economic groups.

Besides the above, the app also helps children with curricular topics like reading, mathematics and science.

Learning Yogi was co-founded by the husband and wife team of Sumantra Roy from India and Rubia Braun from Australia, both of whom are successful serial entrepreneurs. They established Learning Yogi in 2014 in Bengaluru with the aim of using technology to revolutionise the education system.

The current version of the Atlas Mission app is focused primarily on kids aged 3 - 7 years. In the years to come, the product will encompass all age groups from 2 to 16. The contents are in English and the app can be easily downloaded on Android, iOS and Kindle.

Roy said, ""The Atlas Mission app helps children master skills that are required for success in the 21st century. While playing the game, children virtually visit different countries around the world and learn about the unique cultural characteristics of those countries. This helps children develop an appreciation for cultural diversity at a young age.""

Braun said their vision is to ensure that economically disadvantaged kids around the world get access to a high quality education. ""We have incorporated a non-profit sister organisation called the Learning Yogi Foundation which will partner with other non-profit organisations to distribute the Atlas Mission to low-income communities in developing countries"", she added.

Roy started his first venture at the age of 16, when he was still in school. He brings with him a diversified background in technology, education and marketing. Before Learning Yogi, he founded two other companies in the technology space.

""The response so far has been extremely positive. Parents have also commented on how their kids have significantly improved their reading skills after playing with the Atlas Mission. The challenge is hiring the right people who will be a good fit with our culture and our mission. It is very important for us that anyone who joins us understands the importance of the work we do ,"" said Braun.

The team makes sure to maintain the right balance between play and learning in all their games. They have already started building content for other age groups and are looking for partners to scale up their social impact.

Where did the idea come from?

""We always felt that the education system in most countries was doing a poor job of teaching children the skills they need to succeed in today's world. In spite of decades of effort, many countries haven't been able to ensure that underprivileged kids have access to high-quality education opportunities. So we started Learning Yogi in order to reinvent the education system for the 21st century,"" said the couple.

Meet the team

The team members are a talented international group of children's education and UX specialists (user experience), game developers, game designers and artists who have worked with organisations like Electronic Arts, BBC Kids, Disney, Sesame Street, etc."
"132","1027450761","2018-12-27","http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/english/2018/dec/26/shirkers--for-the-love-of-cinema-1916879.html","Shirkers : for the love of cinema","The New Indian Express",FALSE,"Aditya Shrikrishna There is a whole genre called found footage cinema, but what if prized footage was thought to be lost forever? Sandi Tan's Netflix documentary Shirkers is about one such piece of footage. She and her friends, Jasmine Ng and Sophia Siddique, made an avant-garde film in Singapore in the early 90s and then the cans of film disappeared. They had called the film Shirkers. Tan and her friends were young, rebels in their own way with self-published magazines, film writings, underground clubs and strong likes, dislikes and opinions on cinema.

At one point, Ng says something about Tan liking Bergman, and the latter is quick to correct -- ""I hate Bergman!"". They talk about cult indie films of Singapore like They Call Her Cleopatra Wong and their love for pop culture. When Tan says she and Jasmine devoured pop culture that people around them ignored, Tamil Nadu's own MGR makes an appearance. Part of the generation that lived through phases like the chewing gum ban in Singapore, they grew up in an age of censorship that gave way to more compelling, rebellious art in the young minds of Tan, Ng and Siddique.

At the film's pivot sits Georges Cardona, Tan and Ng's film school teacher who nurtured their love for cinema. An enigmatic figure, Cardona introduced Tan to French New Wave, to Breathless and Godard. Every cinema lover has a father figure introducing an impressionable mind to the joys of cinema and its myriad characters. For Tan and her friends, it was Cardona, the Singaporeans awed by the white man sharing crazy, weird, intriguing stories and anecdotes about himself and about films (he once claimed Jayne Mansfield's decapitated head rolled over to the side of his car!).

They may be apocryphal but Cardona at first comes across as that arresting raconteur who can overawe anyone with the gift of the gab. Some of the joyous moments in Shirkers are in the portions where Tan discovers cinema and falls in love with it -- Blue Velvet, The Seventh Seal, Rushmore, Ghost World, Blow Up. A familiar, identifiable phase for any cinephile. Early in the film, Tan says that one of Cardona's favourite films and influences is Werner Herzog's Fitzcarraldo, about the rubber baron played by Klaus Kinski, who exploits the indigenous people of Peru in transporting a steamship over a hill.

The parallels in Shirkers begin to grate at you soon enough. In the beginning of the film, Sandi Tan talks about how to go forward she had to move backwards. As the cans of Shirkers make their way to her, she starts to pull back the pages in search of the memories of George Cardona and the people associated with him. Shirkers, directed by Tan, goes through a dramatic shift in tone in the latter half. The documentary begins to feel like horror, with the ghost of Cardona as its guiding spirit, haunting the footage wherever it goes. Tan uses clay figurines made to look like stop motion animation to bring to life some of Cardona's gaudy stories.

After all, what Cardona did with Tan and her friends was textbook ghosting. Tan meets Cardona's widow who seems as stumped as she is, and talks to a cinematographer who worked in Steven Soderbergh's Sex, Lies and Videotape. One of Cardona's apocryphal stories was about how he was the inspiration behind James Spader's character in Soderbergh's Palme d'Or-winning film. Cardona is an inscrutable figure who like all incomplete filmmakers is a voyeur at first.

An ex-friend of Cardona describes his complications perfectly -- ""He was good with women, he could get what he wanted from them and what he wanted wasn't always sex."" Tan, along with them, tries to piece together the unending jigsaw puzzle in her life called Georges Cardona. Shirkers ultimately becomes a tale of emotional abuse and intellectual theft, robbing Tan and her friends of a shared memory as dear to them as life itself.

They come undone by several things at once -- the politics and censorship in Singapore, and the white man pretending to be their teacher and saviour. But it is also about cinema and the love for the medium. Tan's first few words in the documentary are, ""You found freedom by building worlds inside your heads."" If that isn't an accurate definition of cinema, I am not sure what is. Shirkers celebrates cinema and places it as something that is as ephemeral as it is timeless.

In the end someone mentions how the film Shirkers never had a life, but through this experience of Tan (not to mention this documentary itself), it has attained an afterlife. Cinema is personal. Not everyone reacts the same way to a particular film and one's experience of it is influenced by a host of variables. And Shirkers, a script written and filmed on a whim, is as personal as they come. This documentary is an ode to passions and passion projects around the world."

Lever had said, ""I believe that nothing can be greater than a business, however small it may be, that is governed by conscience; and that nothing can be meaner or pettier than a business however large, governed without honesty and without brotherhood."" The group's ""legacy of doing well by doing good"" elevates it effortlessly to the position of sectoral leader in BW Businessworld's list of the Most Respected Companies of 2018 in the fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) segment.

With net sales of Rs 34,530 crore (on gross revenue of Rs 35,218 crore) and an EBITDA (earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation) of Rs 7,276 crore, Hindustan Unilever is without doubt a market leader in the FMCG horizon in India. In the 2017-18 financial year HUL's cash from operations was Rs 8,000 crore, an increase of Rs 1,369 crores over the previous fiscal. At HUL, integrated e-tendering, smart inventory modelling, digital factory, smart robotics and an efficient fulfilment centre are technological buzzwords.

Hindustan Unilever's earnings are slated to get a boost with the proposed merger with GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Limited (GSKCH). The amalgamation of Hindustan Unilever and GSKCH has recently been approved by the HUL Board of Directors. The scheme approved will entail the existing shareholders 4.39 shares of HUL for every share in GSKCH India, valuing the total business at Rs 31,700 crore, subject to requisite approvals from statutory authorities and shareholders.

Some of the milestones in Hindustan Unilever's list of achievements include the company's beverage factory in Kolkata receiving the prestigious Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) National Food Safety Award 2017 for outstanding achievements in food safety. Hindustan Unilever's Puducherry Home & Personal Care (HPC) factory secured the second place at the CII's Southern Region Environment, Health & Safety (EHS) Excellence Awards 2017 in the 'Manufacturing - Others' category.

Responding to queries at the annual investors' meet, Sanjiv Mehta outlined strategies for Hindustan Unilever's strategy for specialised markets. He said, ""We also know how to build a small brand and make it mighty. The question is, when HUL grows a small brand into a Rs 1,000 crore brand, it doesn't receive as much focus as a player who is very small and creates a niche property of Rs 200 crore. We wish them well. Many times they open up new segments.""

Hindustan Unilever has often been called a 'Leadership Factory'. At last count, the company had unleashed 500 leaders into the corporate world. The company's leadership practices have ensured that it is the 'No1 Employer of Choice' for business school students for seven consecutive years in a row. The company does not lag behind in the sphere of social responsibility either.

The 700 sq ft contemporary house has two bedrooms, a living room and a kitchen.

Six months ago, Poiyakal had been on the verge of being rendered homeless. She was living alone in her nephew's house, but he decided to sell it to raise money for his daughter's wedding.

""I had nowhere to go. No one was ready to help me,"" says the single woman.

Asmabi's last hope was Mohammed Rafi (40), known in his ""huge friends' circle"" as Vatis Rafi. He was building a house free of cost for Abdul Salam (45), an autorickshaw driver, and his mother Nafeesa (70) in the neighbourhood. For years, the aged mother and son lived in a shed without water or a power connection.

Asmabi approached Rafi. He said let's see what can be done. In a week's time, Vatis Rafi started the construction of the house for her.

This is the third house he is building for the homeless.

Before Salam's house, he had built a 1000 sqft house for Hamsa, another autorickshaw driver. All the three houses are built in contemporary style, are spacious and look chic. They are all designed by him.

""Just because they are poor does not mean they do not have a desire to live in a beautiful house. That's why I ensure that the houses are tastefully made,"" says Rafi.

Rafi, a school dropout, has studied only up to class 4. Today, he is a small-time marble and granite seller. He lives with Beefathima, his wife of 20 years, and three sons in a 1000 sq ft house at her native place Paduppu.

""If you ask me, Vatis Rafi cannot make a similar house for himself. But he has a big heart and a big circle of friends who are helping him do it,"" says Hassankutty Kattakal, a social worker and member of the Bekal Janamaitri Police committee.

Each of the houses he has built cost between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 8 lakh, says Rafi, who is from Melparamba.

He has a novel way to keep cost low. He goes around looking for people demolishing houses to build new ones. ""When I tell them my need, they give away one or two doors or windows free of cost,"" he says.

Then there is crowdsourcing. He taps people for whom he has worked.

""I have delivered granite for lawyers, farmers, government employees, bankers. When I ask for a one or two bags of cement, I will never deny. They haven't done it yet,"" he says.

His biggest resources are his friends. ""They are my only asset,"" he says.

But he is careful not to burden them. He does not ask for more than five bags of cement from a person, or one truckload of metal or laterite stones form a person. Importantly, he never takes money.

""I ask them to supply the material. Handling money is a headache,"" he says.

He also makes sure he never asks the same person to donate twice. ""If I ask one person to donate 25 bags of cement, he will never pick my call again,"" he says and laughs.

""Behind each house, there are scores of good souls,"" he says. That's one reason why he does not pose for photographs with the beneficiaries.

In 2019, he has committed to build two more houses. ""Hope I will be able to pull them off too,"" he says."

SYNOPSIS

There is no consensus on what the Indo-Pacific concept will cover. It is not clear what kind of structure is needed for such an Indo-Pacific construct. Nevertheless, the main protagonists behind the Indo-Pacific concept continue their diplomatic efforts to crystalise such a strategy. ASEAN remains non-committal even though it has reasserted ASEAN centrality.

COMMENTARY

INDIA, JAPAN and the United States held their first trilateral meeting on the sidelines of the recently concluded G20 Summit in Buenos Aires. Invariably deliberating on the Indo-Pacific, the leaders of the three countries agreed that a ""free, open, inclusive and rules-based"" order is essential for the Indo-Pacific's peace and prosperity.

They also stated the importance of meeting in a trilateral format at multilateral conferences. Coined as the JAI meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi explained the significance of the JAI (Japan, America, India) acronym, which translates to ""success"" in Hindi.

JAI Troika

The JAI grouping is shaping up to play a key role in Indian foreign policy. India has proposed the three countries synergise their infrastructure projects and other efforts in the region. Tokyo and New Delhi have already agreed to deepen naval and maritime-security cooperation and collaborate on infrastructure projects in third countries, including Myanmar, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka, to enhance strategic connectivity in the Indo-Pacific.

Assuring all countries of the inclusiveness and openness of the Indo-Pacific concept, PM Modi articulated five action points that would serve the common interest of promoting peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region -- connectivity, sustainable development, maritime security, disaster relief and freedom of navigation.

Modi also underlined the importance of building consensus on an architecture in the Indo-Pacific region based on principles of mutual benefit and respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity.

Question of Implementation

While stakeholders have a broad agreement on the principles that the Indo-Pacific concept entails, what needs to be discussed next is the implementation of these principles of freedom of navigation, peaceful resolution of disputes, and a rules-based order.

Without addressing the question of implementation and lacking clarity on the specifics, countries in the region including ASEAN will continue to remain hesitant to embrace the Indo-Pacific concept.

According to Kavi Chongkittavorn, ASEAN member states showed different levels of scepticism to the Indo-Pacific concept. The Philippines and Cambodia were the most reluctant to discuss the initiative within the ASEAN framework fearing it might hurt ASEAN centrality, while Laos, Brunei and Myanmar were silent.

However, they became more receptive to discussions as more information became available. Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia seem to be supportive of the initiative although each of them would like to shape different aspects of the Indo-Pacific concept in pursuant of their respective strategic interests.

Changing Strategic Paradigm?

The strategic paradigm has changed in the Indian Ocean and the debate now is how to respond. Washington and New Delhi have time and again reiterated that ASEAN centrality is key to the Indo-Pacific concept as it embodies regional inclusivity and multilateral trade. ASEAN already has in place a set of inter-linking regional mechanisms such as the East Asia Summit (EAS), ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) and ASEAN Defence Ministers Meeting (ADMM) Plus, designed to engage big powers and neighbouring countries.

The Indo-Pacific framework should make use of these existing mechanisms to ensure that the Indian Ocean region has complementary rather than competing mechanisms. For instance, ASEAN can engage its ASEAN Maritime Forum to complement efforts by the Indian Ocean RIM Association (IORA) and the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS).

ASEAN can also engage BIMSTEC as an economic sub-grouping in the Bay of Bengal involving Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal and Bhutan, especially since two of the BIMSTEC members (Myanmar and Thailand) are also member states of ASEAN. BIMSTEC's connectivity projects in the Bay of Bengal region will greatly benefit from ASEAN's involvement.

ASEAN's role in the Indo-Pacific Framework

To get ASEAN on board with the Indo-Pacific concept, it is essential the Southeast Asian grouping plays a role in defining the evolving regional security architecture which follows. Since Indonesia has been the most active among ASEAN member states in articulating its version of the Indo-Pacific, Jakarta has been tasked by ASEAN to finalise the ASEAN concept paper on the Indo-Pacific.

Although the concept paper is still being drawn up, ASEAN diplomats have alerted ASEAN dialogue partners that the ASEAN framework will not toe the line of the US-inspired strategy despite some overlap on key principles. Furthermore, it will be inclusive and not aimed at any particular power.

It will also come with practical measures and action plans. ASEAN aims to synergise elements of Washington, Tokyo and India's concepts with ASEAN-led projects concerning infrastructure development, governance and maritime cooperation.

ASEAN foreign ministers are scheduled for a retreat in Chiang Mai in January 2019 and will have the opportunity to further deliberate on ASEAN's vision for the Indo-Pacific.

Need to Continue Engagement

The Indian Ocean is a contested, complex and congested region. Each stakeholder has their own perception of what the ""Free and Open Indo-Pacific"" (FOIP) means. For Washington, the Indo-Pacific stretches from the west coast of the United States to the west coast of India. For Tokyo and New Delhi, it lies from the west coast of the US to the east coast of Africa.

The US has emphasised the power dynamics underlying the FOIP while Japan has highlighted its economic potential. To Japan, the FOIP is open to all countries which observe the rule of law, freedom of navigation, and relevant standards of transparency and sustainable development.

While stressing that no one is excluded, the US aspires to a regional order of independent nations in the Indo-Pacific that defends its populations, respects human dignity, competes fairly in the market place, and is free from great-power domination. Thus, it may not be easy for China to be part of the FOIP even if Beijing wished to be included.

As different states have different understandings of the idea of Indo-Pacific, it is critical to ensure that the Indo-Pacific concept does not create misunderstandings. To this end, there is a need to continue engagement with ASEAN member states and stakeholders in the Indian Ocean so that all Indian Ocean actors are on the same page. More so now that Australia, India and Indonesia are heading into electoral campaigning in 2019.

Tamil heritage Trust in association with Tamil Virtual Academy, organised lectures on Chola heritage. Excerpts from a few of them:

Prof. Balusamy, Associate Professor, Madras Christian College, said that 17 Chola kings were praised in Sangam literature, and many Chola kings such as Kulamutrathu Thunjiya Killi and Kopperuncholan themselves wrote verses. Pattinappalai talks of poets who would erect a staff before their houses, which meant that they were ready for any intellectual challenge. Karikalan not only showered poets with gold, but walked alongside them, to see them off. Uruthirankannanar, the author of Pattinappalai received 16 lakh gold coins from Karikalan!

Poets were counsellors to their kings, steering them in the right path. When a Chola king wanted to trample the children of Malayaman under the foot of an elephant, Kovoor Kizhar reminded him that he belonged to the lineage of King Sibi, who gave his own flesh to save the life of a pigeon.

Ninety-eight per cent of the literature of the later Chola period (9th to 13th century C.E.) was religious. Buddhism, Jainism, Saivism and Vaishnavism were all supported by the Chola kings. But one puzzle remains unanswered, said Balusamy. Although Buddhadattar mentions monasteries built by Kannan Dasan and Venu Dasan, and although there were Buddhist settlements in Nagapattinam, Uraiyur, Nagamangalam, Kaveripoompattinam and Sangamangalam, why is there not much Buddhist literature except for Virasozhiyam?

The Jains were prolific authors. Sivaga Chintamani dispels the wrong notion that Jainism lost adherents because of its rigidity. It shows us that the joys of life were not frowned upon by the Jains. Sivaga Chintamani gave Tamil literature Virutha Yaappu, which later poets like Kamban used extensively.

Works of the Nayanmars were organised into the Thirumurai during the reign of the Cholas. Saivism acquired a new dimension, when Saiva Siddhanta with its pasu, pati, pasa concepts gained currency. While the ideas are to be found in the Thevaram and Thiruvachagam, it was only in the 13th century that Meikandar consolidated the ideas. Scholar Kailasapathy viewed the growth of Saivism in Chola Nadu from a Marxist angle. Jainism was the religion of the merchants, while Saivism and Vaishnavism were the religions of the landowners. When the landowners gained the upper hand, their religions became dominant, explained Balusamy. Economic dominance and the building of huge temples like the Big Temple, helped the growth of Saivite literature.

Periyapuranam shows the kind of field work Sekkizhar must have undertaken. From Thiruvilaiydal Puranam, we learn about the city of Madurai. The Parani genre came into existence in the Chola period. But what began as literature that glorified military victory, transitioned into religious literature, as seen from Ottakoothar's Thakka Yaga Parani. Avvaiyar gave us didactic literature through her Kondrai Vendan and Athichoodi. Kamba Ramayanam, as scholar Prof. Manavalan pointed out, was not an adaptation or translation, but an original work. The period of the Cholas was also the age of commentaries. For instane, the works of Peria Vachan Pillai. Vaishnava scholars came up with the concept of padi, which is a unit of 32 letters. With this as a base, they wrote commentaries called 6,000 padi, 24,000 padi and so on.

Grammar works and nikantus were written in the Chola period. Inscriptions tell us that a drama about Raja Raja was enacted in the Big Temple. Kesava Sami, upon orders from Raja Raja II, tried his hand at an alphabetical index for Sanskrit!

Inference from Meikirthis

The first few lines of inscriptions, record praises of kings, and are referred to as Meikirthi. To the Cholas, particularly Raja Raja I, goes the credit of recording Meikirthis, from which we can glean many historical facts, said epigraphist S. Ramachandran.

One of the most important references in Raja Raja's Meikirthi is his destruction of Kandalur Salai. Kandalur Salai was not a school run by Brahmins, near Thiruvananthapuram, as believed by many scholars. Ramachandran argued that Kandalur was a place adjacent to the backwaters near Thirunava, where Kshatriyas were trained. Once every 12 years, during Mahamakham, a Cheraman Perumal would be chosen from amongst the students of this Kshatriya academy and crowned King of Valluva Nadu. It was this academy that Raja Raja destroyed.

The academy seems to have sprung up again, as is seen from claims of destruction of Kandalur Salai by Raja Raja's successors right up to the time of Kulottunga I. These victories, starting in 988 C.E. (Raja Raja's time) to 1114 C.E., are recorded in the Meikirthis of the respective kings. Ramachandran presented a paper on the subject at Tamil University, where he pointed out the reason for this repeated destruction. The Cholas must have seen the democratic way of selecting a leader which was followed in Chera Nadu as a threat to the hereditary power system they themselves followed in Chola Nadu. The last Cheraman king Kulasekara Varma handed over the kingdom to the Nambudiris in 1114 C.E, and only after this Kerala became Parasurama kshetra.

The original Chera kings were Kshatriyas, not descendants of the Brahmin Parasurama. This can be inferred from a Meikirti of Rajendra I, where he distinguishes between his victories against Rama Kuda Moovar and Kandalur Salai. Rama Kuda Moovar were kings, who ruled near the Northern boundary of Chera Nadu, in Ezhirkundram, a place mentioned in Sangam literature and also by Avvai (12-13 centuries). (The place is now called Mount de Eli). The word 'Rama' in Rama Kuda Moovar, indicates Parasurama and the ancestor of the kings who ruled in Ezhirkundram, was anointed with water from Parasurama's pot.

Rajadhi Raja I's Meikirti says that a Chola prince's rule was established in Kannauj. This must have been a response to the assaults of Mohammed Ghazni. Kulottunga I's Meikirti says that he trusted his powerful shoulders and his sword and not his relatives. This must have been because his uncle Vira Rajendra Chola gave his daughter in marriage to the Western Chalukya King Vikkalan, and also installed Kulottunga's uncle Vijayaditya on the throne of Vengi, which was rightfully Kulottunga's. The Chola-Chalukya marriage and the usurpation of the Vengi throne, with the blessings of his uncle Vira Rajendra led Kulottanga to conclude that his relatives were untrustworthy, and that he had to rely on his own strength.

Ramachandran says that inscriptional and other evidences point to 1077 C.E. as the birth year of Vaishnava Acharya Ramanuja. Poet Ottakkoothar records that Kulottunga II threw the Chidambaram Govindaraja idol into the sea. Raja Raja II was the son of Kulottunga II. Raja Raja II's Meikirthi praises him saying - ""vizhunda ari samayathai meela edethu,"" meaning that he saved the religion of Hari, which had faced serious problems.

Garuda Vahana pandita says that Ramanuja attained moksha during the reign of Tribhuvana Vira Devan, a title of Kulottunga III. So, Ramachandran concludes that Ramanuja was born in 1077 C.E, left Chola Nadu because of Kulottunga II's fanaticism, and shuffled off his mortal coils in 1197 C.E. The Vellalas gained prominence in Kulottunga III's time, and even used his Meikirthi as their own!"
"137","1027384810","2018-12-27","https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/music/sowmya-sings-a-more-than-500-year-old-raga/article25840780.ece","Sowmya sings a more than 500-year-old raga","The Hindu",FALSE,"""Heard melodies are sweet; those unheard are sweeter"" -- S. Sowmya, a post-graduate in science from IIT Madras, gave a glimpse of a long-forgotten raga in her concert at The Music Academy. The timing was perfect, the audience was receptive, and the cognoscenti were there to take note. Sowmya informed the audience that she was going to present a raga, more than 500 years old, which is not frequently heard in concert circuits. This was Ghanta. She presented a Ragam-Tanam-Pallavi in the raga. The Pallavi was her own composition -- ""Iswaram Sarveswaram Ghanteswaram.""

What is special about Ghanta? It is a Mishra Raga, within which we can hear shades of Dhanyasi, Bhairavi, Thodi, Asaveri and Punnagavarali. It is a Rainbow-Raga, and what we hear is only a reflection of the raga and not the raga itself.

Subbarama Dikshitar, in his Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini, refers to the Raga compendium of Muddu Venkatamakhi and places Ghanta under Bhairavi, modern Melakarta 20. According to Venkatamakhi, Ghanta is to be rendered only in the evenings. Prof. Sambamoorthy published Pallaki Seva Prabhanda, highlighting the melody of Ghanta handled by composers three centuries ago.

Sangeetha Sampradaya Pradarshini classifies certain ragas, such as Dhanyasi and Bhoopalam as morning ragas, Reva Gupti and Bowli as ragas for late nights, Ahiri for the first quarter of the night and Gowri, Sri, Bhairavi, Madhyamavati and Ghanta as evening ragas.

The notes of Ghanta are ornamented with Kampita Gamakas. It was Venkatamakhi, who classified Ghanta under Bhairavi Mela in his Chaturdandi Prakashikha.

The Experts Committee of The Madras Music Academy debated the Raga Lakshana of Ghanta in December 1933 and concluded that:

- The dominant notes came from Bhairavi and in order to differentiate itself from Bhairavi, a Shuddha Rhishabha and Chatusruti Dhaivata were employed.

- In certain other versions, the raga acquired a definitive Dhanyasi flavour, and later on, the colour of Punnagavarali. It is as old as Bhairavi and Ahiri and cannot be grouped under a particular Mela. It can be best understood in terms of Murcchanas/Phrases, which would be the building blocks.

- Depending on the particular Prayoga of PMGRS, we can impart to Ghanta a flavour of Bhairavi, Thodi or Asaveri.

- Ghanta is a designer Raga which allows the composer and performer freedom to choose amongst those melodic blocks to build a particular flavour of Raga.

Swati Tirunal gave a Dhanyasi flavour to Ghanta in his Chauka Varna composition. The Kshetrayya Padams are examples of the Thodi/Punnagavarali flavour.

What about the Trinity? Tyagaraja rendered a Mangalam in Ghanta with Punnagavarali flavour. He never disclosed the raga of his songs. It was left to his disciples to tag the ragas with names. The authenticity of the raga attributed to Tyagaraja's Mangalam is still being debated. Muthuswami Dikshitar selected Ghanta as one of the ragas for his Navavarana Kriti, 'Kamalambikam.' Eminent flautist T. Vishwanathan rendered Dikshitar's kriti in Ghanta as he learnt it from another Sangeetha Kalanidhi, Brinda.

Vidwan Pattamadai Sundaram Iyer has left for us a home recording of this Navavarana Kriti. In recent times, Sanjay Subrahmanyan has rendered this particular Navavarana Kriti with great elegance. Dikshitar's other composition, 'Sri Mangalambikam,' has not been heard at all in the concert halls. Dikshitar has rendered yet another composition in Ghanta -- 'Sri Mangalambikam,' on the Goddess of Kumbakonam, who is seated on the Sri Vidya Mantra Pita.

As Sowmya was exploring the prism like structure of the many hued ghanta, she found able support from the Bangalore based Charulatha Ramanujam of the Kumbakonam Rajamanickam school lending the much needed old world charm through her classical violin accompaniment. Neyveli Narayanan, a disciple of Umayalpuram Sivaraman was exuberant in his enthusiastic classical accompaniment on the mridangam.

A decade ago, T.V. Sankaranarayanan thrilled the audience at The Music Academy by his eloquent presentation of raga Surya. Mangalampalli Balamuralikrishna would surprise the audience with new interpretations of familiar ragas. Vidwans owe it to themselves, and to the expert audience, to bring back to life and currency melodies long-forgotten. But such presentations have become few and far-between. The Music Academy is the ideal forum for such bold ventures."

Of the 81 government colleges opened in five years, 73 were new colleges, while eight were bifurcated. The bifurcation process includes opening separate colleges for science, commerce and art streams out of existing colleges.

Admissions to these colleges have taken place and classes are going on but the buildings of 47 colleges are under construction.

Several of colleges opened in the past five years run out of classrooms borrowed from nearby government schools, including the government colleges in Sri Dungargarh and Kolayat, Bikaner district.

Moreover, a building that dates back to the British era exists on the land. Hence, construction of a college building there may be difficult,"" said Dr. Dinesh Tiwari, assistant director, college education, (Kota Zone).

Reacting to the present condition of the colleges opened under the BJP regime, party spokesperson Mukesh Pareek said: ""The BJP government opened new colleges heeding public demand. At some places the colleges are running out of different buildings but in most of the places, the colleges have enough space. For example, Poddar school in Jaipur had huge space and a college was opened in the same campus. The BJP government did better work in the education sector in five years than the previous Congress regime.""

Satyendra Singh Raghav, spokesperson of the Congress, said: ""The BJP government kept making new announcements and schemes but did not work on the ground. They did not check the condition of the schools and colleges or the schemes on ground."""

The guide was developed by a multi-agency team that included experts in the field and members of the California Department of Education's (CDE) Social and Emotional Learning State Team, a group that has been meeting since 2016 with the goal of advancing social and emotional learning.

""This new guide offers a toolkit of resources that will assist California educators in serving the social and emotional needs of the whole child,"" said Torlakson. ""Science confirms that learning is not only cognitive, but also social and emotional. These resources help students develop the skills they need to function well in the classroom, the community, in college and their careers.""

Social-emotional skills include the ability to: set and achieve positive goals; feel and show empathy for others; establish and maintain positive relationships; make responsible decisions; and understand and manage emotions. The CDE is committed to helping educators learn more about social and emotional learning and how to make this a part of every child's school experience. To support this work, CDE joined the Collaborating States Initiative, a group of eight states that share information, best practices, promising tools, and ideas in the interest of building strong programs in schools across their states. The Collaborating States Initiative is hosted by the Collaborative for Academic Social and Emotional Learning.

In 2017, the CDE and its partners created California's Social and Emotional Learning Guiding Principles, a set of statements intended to provide guidance to education leaders at counties, districts, schools, and expanded learning programs. Then it began gathering a comprehensive list of resources aligned with these principles.

This new guide was compiled in collaboration with officials from Massachusetts, Minnesota, Washington, and Tennessee. Also included are resources created with the help of staff in California districts leading the way on systemic social and emotional learning: Los Angeles Unified School District, Oakland Unified School District, Palo Alto Unified School District, Sacramento City Unified School District, and San Francisco Unified School District. See the full Guide (PDF) on the CDE's Social and Emotional Learning webpage."

India's top intellectuals nominate the next generation. Here is their list of some of the brightest minds on the horizon.

Intellectuals are an essential component of an open society -- they bring their unique analytical insights to not only scrutinise the society in its immediate form but also help shape the ideas and ideologies of the future. They conduct research, deploy critical thinking, reason, teach, author books, challenge dogma and equip us with cognitive tools to engage with the world we inhabit -- just for the love of knowledge, or for the greater human good.

India has a rich and ancient tradition of producing such thinkers, teachers and philosophers who have contributed to the creation of new schools of thought that have travelled and established themselves far beyond Indian shores too. They have also passed on their learnings and discoveries to successive generations to preserve, innovate upon and further.

But who are the next generation of Indian intellectuals in the modern times we inhabit? The next Ramachandra Guha, the next Arvind Panagariya, the next Ashok Gulati, the next Raghuram Rajan, the next Makarand Paranjape, or the next Shashi Tharoor?

Over the last few months, ThePrint spoke to some of the biggest names in Indian intelligentsia and asked them who, in their opinion, are the brightest minds on the horizon -- in history, economics, sociology, political studies, law, strategic affairs, philosophy, public affairs, and inter-disciplinary studies, among others.

What follows is a long and impressive list of next-gen intellectuals who have begun to make a mark and given notice of their coming brilliance. Some of the nominees were directly mentored by the veterans who named them while the others are those whose work they track closely. This is by no means an exhaustive list and will be updated when more intellectuals respond to our requests.

Here's the list, in alphabetical order of the names of the nominators:

A trained sociologist and clinical psychologist, Nandy's area of expertise is the psychology of violence, the psychology of genocide and the future of ideas.

On his choices, Nandy said: ""All three have special relevance in the 150th year of Gandhi's birth.""

But he adds: Two warnings first. I am in my 80s now; I have seen four generations pass by. Those who look young to me do not look that young to others. Also, those in their 20s and 30s have not often got the chance to find themselves and to display their talent or promise. My own first book was published when I was in my 40s.""

His picks are:

Devji is professor of Indian history at St Antony's College, Oxford. He is an expert on modern Islamic studies and ethics, and violence in a globalised world.

Muralidharan, professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, is a doctorate from Harvard University. His research focuses on health and education in developing countries.

Varshney said of him: ""His work is very technically economic, so in the larger public sphere, his presence is limited, unlike the economics profession, where he towers in his cohort. He has started writing a book for the larger audiences on India's economy. We might know more soon.""

Named Board of Higher Secondary Education (BHSE), it is estimated to having provided marksheets and certificates of classes X and XII to over 55,000 students for a hefty price.

Three people, including the ""chairman"" Altaf Raja, have been arrested. The two others, Shambhu Nath and Manoj Kumar, are school owners.

Additional commissioner (crime) Rajiv Ranjan said that the gang charged between Rs 10,000 and Rs 30,000 for the certificates. This syndicate was also involved in providing documents of higher studies from renowned institutes across India. ""A team led by DCP Rajesh Deo and ACP Jasbir Singh tracked down Raja after a complaint from Directorate of Education, Delhi government,"" he added.

A decoy customer was sent to Raja's office with a request for a marksheet and he was caught while delivering it. Raja used to collect the details of students over WhatsApp and receive the amount for providing fake documents through NEFT. The certificate would then be mailed to the student's address. During the raid at the Vikaspuri apartment, several fake marksheets and certificates were seized from him.

During interrogation, Raja told police that he left studies and started working in the office of one Dr Shiv Prasad Pandey in Lucknow. He came to know that Pandey posed as the chairman of Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi and ran a branch office in Lucknow. After Pandey's arrest last year, Raja decided to take over the board and started issuing certificates in his own name.

Police have also identified one Ashok Kumar Lakhani as the secretary of the board. He owns a school in the same building from which the board was being run.

Recently, Raja had issued a certificate to a woman who has enrolled with UP Police. UP Police has been informed about it to take legal action against her.

Surprisingly, the racket wasn't unknown to police. Last year, when Pandey was arrested, a probe revealed that the fake board's original owner Mange Ram Acharya was arrested in 2011 from Timarpur. He is currently in a jail in Rajasthan.

The board's operation continued even after the arrest of Pandey who was using the same website and the same name. The website was blocked for a few days, but the crooks somehow managed to reactivate it and continue with their scam."

Ramdhuni and poornahuti were organised in Ajmer on Tuesday. Both BJP MLAs from Ajmer were part of the event. The event is said to be a part of a nation wide series of similar events held across the country for atmosphere building. They have been scheduled at a later date in states that were scheduled to go to polls.

Postholders and functionaries of VHP and Bajrang Dal along with public representatives gathered at the function organised in the city. They chanted the Ramdhuni and prayed for the sadbuddhi (better sense prevailing) of the Union government. While similar prayer meets were organised in different states, the events have picked up now in five states including Rajasthan that were scheduled to have assembly elections.

The events assume more significance after the defeat of BJP in three Hindi heartland states.

Speaking to DNA, district functionary Lekhraj Singh said, ""Similar events are being held in all districts of Rajasthan and the country. We as a community have been patient for the last 130 years that the case has been in court.

What more patience can we exhibit that even today. We have a government of our party at the Centre and all we are doing is praying that they bring an Ordinance for construction of Ram Temple in Ayodhya.""

Former school education minister and legislator from Ajmer, Vasudev Devnani said to DNA, ""We know it is a government of our party and these events are not for exerting pressure.

As party functionaries and public representatives, we are associating with these events to make the Central government aware of the public sentiment in favour of Ram temple construction.""

Rajasthan has had a long association with the Ram Temple agitation. Kar sevaks from the state had gone to Ayodhya in large numbers. Pillars were also carved out at Bayana in Bharatpur as part of preparations for temple construction."

The hostess, identified as Kari Coudriet (46), also perished in the fire. The fire broke around 11 pm. The fire left Kari's husband Danny and son Cole injured.

The Naik family are missionaries in India and are supported by Collierville Bible Church, which posted a condolence message on its Facebook page saying the family was yet to reach the US.

'The siblings were to come home next year'

The details of the events are still being communicated to the family,"" a message from the Collierville Bible Church said.

Sources said the family originally hails from Devarakonda. They are travelling to Collierville to bring the bodies of their dear ones back to India for their last rites. ""Parents are completely traumatised. The three siblings were to come home in July next year,"" said the source.

Sources said the siblings' father, Srinivas, was thrown out of his village for converting to Christianity, but he chose to build a school in the same village. ""He was thrown out of his village for converting to Christianity, but Naik choose to serve his community and villagers by building Aletheia Banjara School and providing them free education. I feel sad for his loss. Though he was from a poor family, he worked hard and gave his children good education abroad and served his community,"" said a family friend.

Officials from Collierville said that the fire broke out due to short circuit."

Staying in Delhi for the past five years, he had worked with several call centres and would send a part of his earnings to his parents back in the village, said his cousin, sitting outside Luksar jail with relatives and friends of the 36 young men and women from Nagaland and Manipur arrested last week for allegedly duping foreign nationals by making fake calls to them.

The bogus operation was run from a building in Sector 63 and busted on December 21 after a tip-off from America's FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation).

A resident of Longkhim village in Tuensang district, Nungsang was earning around Rs 20,000 and shared details of his work with his cousin. ""He has worked in several call centres. He came to Delhi around five years ago to make some money. He has dropped out of school and his parents are still living in the village,"" his cousin Pilichem Sangtam told TOI.

He added, ""Many call centres tend to hire people from the northeast because we have a better command over English and we can learn the American accent easily. He (Nungsang) told me that he would be given a script to read.""

Those who were present around Sangtam and had previously worked in call centres said that such call centres did not hold any interviews and the best way to get into the game was networking. ""Many of the youths, who come to Delhi for jobs or studies, tend to follow their friends who are already settled in Delhi. Call centres scout for people who can acquire an American accent. They hand a script and ask you to practise speaking English like the Americans do. Once you have the accent, you can continue after a few days' trial and earn up to Rs 20,000 a month,"" said a former call centre employee, originally from Nagaland.

The employees are often told that they would be not be touched by police, usually by a supervisor, according to him.

Daniel, the cousin of Soromi (24), a resident of Ukhrul district in Manipur who was also arrested, told TOI that Soromi was married and had a child. ""He came here looking for a job through his friends about three years ago. He was working at this particular call centre for the past two months only. The employees had been assured that they would not be caught,"" he added.

Such call centres had been running for years, said family members, and it was only after they came under the scanner of international agencies that police have woken up and taken action. ""I have worked in such call centres. They assure you that nothing bad will happen and hence, we continue working. We are even aware about the kharcha (bribe) that has to be paid to police, especially around Diwali,"" said another relative on the condition of anonymity.

The families reiterated that the accused were not criminals. ""We are not saying that they are not at fault but what do you expect when there is no opportunity back home? We all want to support our families and get better jobs. Nobody wants to get involved in a crime,"" said Sangtam."

She was delivering a lecture on 'Education: A medium to build leaders for nation', organized by Somalwar Education Society to mark the 64th death anniversary of its founder Annasaheb Somalwar.

Joshi said the Indian culture is one of the oldest in the world. Its roots are so deep that modernization cannot fade it, unlike other ancient cultures. However, she expressed disappointment over the present education system in the country as it is designed in such a way that students tend to forget their culture.

""Students in India are taught about the life of saints and great freedom fighters when they are too young to understand their greatness. And when they are in the right age, they're taught about world wars and the western culture. This is why they have little knowledge about their own nation and rich culture,"" Joshi said.

It is the responsibility of teachers to develop virtues and logic in students. Character building is more important than personality development, she said and wished good luck to the teachers seated in the audience.

She recalled the contribution of saints and great leaders of pre-independence era for the betterment of the society. She then asked those present whether they could remember a single person since the last 70 years who could be listed with those great men.

""Our country has not created leaders after independence. This is because students today are more concerned about career and money, and not about nation and the society. These values are needed to be inculcated in them,"" she added.

Joshi said it is a shame that we're still struggling to bring in culture as a subject in the Indian education system. She blamed the Indian Education Act of 1959 for such a situation. It was a deliberate attempt, she said, to make Indians think and opinionate like the British.

Those present at the programme were Madhukar Somalwar, president of SES, RP Somalwar, Prakash Somalwar, Dr Pande, Seema Somalwar, Mahesh Somalwar and teaching staff of the Somalwar school branches.

This marks Trump's first-ever visit to a war zone. As President, he had not previously visited a combat zone for Christmas - a traditional presidential activity during the holidays.

""He's afraid of those situations,"" a former senior White House official recently told the Washington Post. ""He's afraid people want to kill him.""

The visit occurred on the same day that a New York Times report raised new questions about the bone-spur diagnosis that helped Trump avoid fighting in the Vietnam War.

Trump, who graduated from the New York Military Academy boarding school, received four Vietnam War draft deferments for education during college. Then after he finished school, he received a medical exemption for bone spurs, which kept him from being eligible for the draft.

""I had a minor medical deferment for feet, for a bone spur of the foot, which was minor,"" Trump told ABC News in 2015 during his presidential campaign. ""I was fortunate, in a sense, because I was not a believer in the Vietnam War.""

""I know it was a favor,"" Elysa Braunstein, the daughter of deceased podiatrist Larry Braunstein, told the Times. She said she wasn't sure whether Trump had bone spurs at all.

""If there was anything wrong in the building, my dad would call and Trump would take care of it immediately. That was the small favor that he got,"" Braunstein said.

Bone spurs form in joints, often in places where two bones meet, as a result of joint damage. Heel spurs, similarly, are ""little calcifications that start to form at the bottom of the heel bone,"" podiatric surgeon Jacqueline Sutera previously explained to Business Insider.

The bony projections are similar to plantar fasciitis and can be especially painful first thing in the morning, when a person's feet hit the ground.

""When you're resting, the soft tissue just relaxes and there's a swelling there,"" Sutera said. ""Then you go to stand up on it with all of your body weight, and it starts that inflammation all over again.""

In general, though, bone spurs are not a debilitating condition.

Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil) are both common pain-relievers to help with the swelling from bone spurs. Some people experience no pain from spurs at all, and may never even know they have them. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons estimates that one in 10 people have foot spurs, but only about 5% of those people ever experience foot pain.

Those that do have painful spurs may opt to treat them with stretches, cortisone treatments, physical therapy, orthotics, or surgery."

New York, my home, is only the 21 most polluted city in the world, according to a recent study by Eco Experts, which combines data on air quality, noise pollution, and light pollution. Los Angeles, which I've been to a few times, comes in tenth.

That's a far cry from the cities that top the list, where checking particulate matter levels, or PM, is as routine as checking the weather.

I got my first taste of the smog life in April, when I visited Shanghai and Beijing, seventh and third on the Eco Experts' list, respectively.

While the pollution was noticeable - I saw a blue sky only a few times on that trip - I was in town during comparatively the best time of the year, pollution-wise. The winter in Beijing, when millions are burning coal for heat, is when the real pollution rolls in.

But, as I rode in a taxi from the Cairo Airport this past week, it hit me that I'd entered the big leagues. A city of more than 20 million people, Cairo is the

Every highway, road, and alleyway is clogged with cars and motorbikes spewing fumes into the air. The honking never stops: long honks, short beeps, and everything in between. The cars, and their drivers, are in every kind of conversation imaginable. Other noises proliferate, from street-side shouts to the rumble of construction. Every street seems to have a construction site and a building under renovation or being built.

Cairo is the most polluted city in the world, according to the Eco Experts' report. WHO's Global Ambient Air Quality Database, which solely focuses on multiple measures of air quality, ranks Cairo second worst for PM10, or particulate matter that is 10 micrometers in diameter or less. When judging by PM2.5, or particulate matter that is 2.5 micrometers or less - the worst kind of pollution, according to the Environmental Protection Agency - Cairo is not quite as bad, but still near the bottom.

Particulate pollution is made up a mix of solid and liquid droplets in the air, including sulfates, nitrates, and carbon. It's largely caused by energy used by homes, automobile traffic, manufacturing, and power plants. Sand or desert dust can add to the air pollution. In Cairo's case, the city is located in a valley and has a large industrial sector, tons of traffic, poor waste management, and a dusty climate, according to Arab News.

""Air pollution threatens us all, but the poorest and most marginalized people bear the brunt of the burden,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director general, said in a statement regarding its most recent report.

On average, residents of Cairo breathe in air suffused with 11.7 times the WHO recommended safe level of PM2.5 and 14.2 times the safe level of PM10. Translation: The air is really bad, and you can feel it.

After a few hours walking around in even one of the more green neighborhoods - the embassy-populated, moderately wealthy island of Zamalek - I found myself severely dehydrated despite having a water bottle by my side the whole time. The taste in my mouth was bitter, my nostrils felt caked in dust, and my eyes had grown itchy. The best way to describe it is that it feels like you are constantly at a construction site, with sawdust or concrete dust in the air. After a few days, I'd found that my skin, unused to the pollution, was breaking out in hives on my face.

And that's just the air pollution.

Cairo's noise pollution is arguably even worse, though it is rarely talked about. Eco Experts' research found that Cairo is the third loudest city in the world, after Guangzhou and Delhi. A report by the Egyptian National Research Center found noise pollution in Cairo reaches a daily average of 85 decibels or, in the words of Eco Experts, ""like spending all day inside a factory."" Even at 3 a.m., the honks don't stop.

The aforementioned honking, shouting, and construction noises are ever-present, no matter where you are in the city. It literally leaves your ears ringing. Even as a New Yorker who lived for years above bars in the rambunctious East Village, I found the noise to be a shock.

Combine that with the light pollution - Eco Experts reported Cairo the third-brightest city in the world, with artificial light 85 times brighter than the natural sky - and it all makes for a bad night of sleep.

Every night, I slept with blackout curtains drawn and earplugs in. And still, I found myself to be getting terrible sleep. Every day, I overslept and woke up groggy. Before you assume jet lag, I was in the region for three weeks and slept fine while in the United Arab Emirates.

All of this after a week. Imagine living in it for a few months, a year, or your whole life.

My partner, who has more sensitive lungs than I do, contracted pneumonia and a respiratory infection halfway through a semester studying in Shanghai. When we visited Shanghai in April, she'd contracted a wheezing cough after a day in the city.

Researchers and scientists are still studying the effects of pollution on humans, but it has been connected to health conditions like asthma, lung cancer, heart disease, stroke, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, according to WHO and the EPA. Researchers suspect that pollution is connected to obesity, insomnia, depression, as well as effects on the immune, endocrine, and reproductive systems.

One recent study out of Beijing Normal University's school of statistics found that long-term exposure to particulate matter was correlated with cognitive declines in study participants as they aged.

The Egyptian government pushed back on the Eco Experts report shortly after it was published, criticizing the methodology of the study. But there's no denying the pollution in Cairo. It would appear the Egyptian government agrees with that much.

Earlier this year, the government announced a plan to reduce air pollution by 50% by 2023 and began an initiative to plant one million fruit trees in public spaces throughout the country.

A major pollution issue for Egypt since 1997 has been farmers' yearly burning of leftover rice straw from September to November, which can create a ""dark cloud"" over Cairo. To tackle the issue, the government has offered to buy the straw from farmers for $3 a ton, Mohamed Salah, head of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency said in October. ""Today, the dark cloud season is over and all citizens in Egypt are saying that they have not sensed any problem relating to this, unlike what had happened in previous years,"" Salah said.

But, for this American in Cairo, I found the city to be stark reminder of how lucky the US is when it comes to air quality and pollution and how little we bear the burden of global manufacturing and other polluting industries around the world.

When I told one Beijing resident in April that I head to the countryside outside New York City when I want fresh air, he looked at me incredulously. ""You have to understand, we think of New York City air as pristine,"" he said."

We're asking millennials how they spend their hard-earned money during a seven-day period -- and we're tracking every last dollar.

Today: a sales coordinator working in consumer goods who makes $46,250 per year and spends some of her money this week on the book What If This Were Enough? by Heather Havrilesky.

7:45 a.m. -- Shit, we both overslept. I nudge A. awake and plod over to the kitchen to get breakfast and lunch packed while he's in the shower. Breakfast is a pack of instant grits, a hardboiled egg, and a banana. Lunch is pasta fagioli that we meal prepped earlier in the week.

8:15 a.m. -- I drop A. off at the local T station. The bus in front of our apartment building recently cut service, so we're trying out a new routine this morning to park at the station a half mile away. It fails -- there are no spots left, so I continue into my office where there's free parking and A. heads downtown. Overall, I prefer public transport, because my weekly fares are typically less than the cost of gas for A.'s car. It's paid off, and we take turns paying the gas on it, but I try to do more if I use it more often.

9:45 a.m. -- My morning starts chaotically with a lot of phone calls. I prepare the grits, eat the egg, and fix a cup of coffee with hazelnut creamer.

12:45 p.m. -- I heat up the pasta fagioli. It's made with Barilla protein pasta, which keeps me satisfied until dinner usually. I finish off with the banana.

3:56 p.m. -- I spent a lot of time on the phone today! I mute my conference call and polish off two clementines.

5:45 p.m. -- Heading home! I stop by the grocery store on the way to pick up soy sauce, sesame oil, and parmesan cheese per A.'s request (not all for the same recipe). $13.54

6:15 p.m. -- I heat up some leftover chicken, vegetables, and rice, and A. makes a teriyaki sauce. We chat and go about our evening routine -- making food and washing dishes.

7:30 p.m. -- We watch an episode of The First on Hulu and share some pieces of dark chocolate and red wine. We head to bed around 10.

7:35 a.m. -- Don't do much better with the alarm this morning. I get tea and breakfast ready. A. is meeting a friend for lunch today, so I take the leftover Indian food from his birthday dinner earlier this week! Yum.

8:15 a.m. -- Drop A. off at the T again and we agree to discuss a plan for our commutes next week.

9:15 a.m. -- For breakfast I have two pieces of toast from a loaf of bread I keep in the work freezer. I top them off with a single packet of Justin's Vanilla Almond Butter.

10:30 a.m. -- I check my bank account and move $5.73 to my second checking account. Every day I try to check my current balance and round down to the nearest even $5 or $10 increment by moving the difference into my other account. I manage to save $75-$100 each pay period this way, and I make an extra debt payment with that money.

12:10 p.m. -- I get a Facebook notification that a band A. and I want to see is touring. I decide to surprise him. The tickets are $20 each, but of course I get slapped with those additional fees. Looks like we're going to Buffalo for Valentine's Day weekend! $56.35

12:45 p.m. -- I heat up my leftover Indian food and my boss calls right before I take my first bite. Sigh.

5:45 p.m. -- Home time. I usually like to chill and have downtime on Fridays rather than go out, which also keeps more money in my pocket, too. A. and I hit the liquor store: I buy a Malbec Bota Box, A. gets whiskey and vermouth to make us Manhattans. Yum! $21.39

6:15 p.m. -- We have our Manhattans and chat, and then eat the last of the pasta fagioli when we're hungry. We finish the last episode of The First and fall asleep before 10.

4:35 a.m. -- Saturday morning starts off with our cat knocking a glass of water off the bedside table. She knows A. is mad at her and sulks off for the rest of her witching hour instead of crying incessantly.

9:30 a.m. -- Sleep in a bit after the cat fuss this morning. We start the day slow: drink tea, shower, then talk about our meal planning for next week before we go to the grocery store. We're going to a brewery this afternoon for a friend's birthday and I plan to bake cupcakes instead of buying a gift. For breakfast, we fry an egg and some onions and top it off with the last of some rice and lentils we cooked this week. I am satisfied. (We ate every bite of all the food we prepped this week! Gold star!)

10:30 a.m. -- We hit the grocery store. During our morning planning, we noticed we have four or five open packages of corn tortillas in the fridge, so we make a meal plan to eat those up this week. We're also going to prep ground turkey chili and salsa chicken, so we buy ingredients for those (plus a few other things): chicken thighs on special; red, black, and white beans; snacking fruit; some squash and zucchini, red and green peppers, diced tomatoes, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, chicken stock, ginger, olive oil, garlic, fresh herbs; and cat food. I buy the cupcake ingredients as well. Total comes to $82, and we split. $41

3 p.m. -- We relax and do our own thing until it's time to go out. I bake the cupcakes, do some other chores around the house, and listen to the A Funny Feeling podcast while A. works on some music. He's involved in a lot of musical projects in the area, so it's always great to hear what he's working on. We have a quick bite of lunch before leaving the house. We finish the last of the pasta -- finally! We also get coffee to-go at a coffee shop before getting in the car. I treat. $5.14

3:30 p.m. -- Since we have to travel to another side of town for this outing, we decide to visit the Strip District on the way there, where there are a lot of speciality grocers. It's a big tourist destination so it's usually packed, but the weather is bad and it's late in the day, so this is a good opportunity. We decide to add a mushroom cream pasta as a late birthday treat for A. and shrimp gumbo to our meals this week, as well as a few other specialty things we are running low on. We visit Penn Mac to buy fresh pasta and bread, Wholey's for the shrimp (and we're delighted to find they have massive collard greens, too), Lotus for okra, and Reyna's for Jamaican curry powder, tamales, and salsa. We trade off paying, so I buy the groceries at Reyna's and Lotus. $21.75

4:45 p.m. -- We get to the brewery! Most folks are there already, but I really only know the birthday girl, so we situate ourselves near her. The cupcakes get descended on pretty fast. It's a cool place, but the warehouse environment doesn't absorb noise, so it's hard to hear everyone. The birthday girl and her husband order pizza for the group, and I have a few slices. A. and I have a beer each and he covers our tab. On the way home, I log into my banking app and send her husband what I hope is a fair share for the pizza. They didn't ask anyone for money, but I know it's a lot to feed eight people and I want to contribute. $25

7 p.m. -- We get home in time to watch the Pitt football game. My attention span isn't great for sports, so we share a few glasses of wine and I putter around the kitchen during the game. I have a pie crust in the fridge and decide to bake a pumpkin pie for tomorrow. I never get it quite right, and I feel like this kind of pie is always better made a day ahead.

8 a.m. -- I wake up and take a shower. A. is already up and in the kitchen. When I come out, he's made an amazing breakfast casserole with some of our many tortillas. Genius! We tuck in and chat. He's off to the studio today to record one of his music projects and is pretty excited.

10:30 a.m. -- It's unseasonably warm -- 61 degrees in December! I have plans today to hang out with a friend who lives close by. I say goodbye to A., wish him luck, and walk the mile to her house.

11:15 a.m. -- My friend and I chat over coffee and catch up while her boyfriend makes stewed chicken with homemade pita bread, which smells divine. I have a bite, even though breakfast wasn't that long ago. We have The Final Table on Netflix playing in the background.

1:30 p.m. -- My friend is also a big meal prepper, so I run along with her on her errands but don't need anything myself. Once we're back, she puts together a lovely black bean soup.

4:30 p.m. -- I head home to get a head start on dinner, as well as make turkey chili for the week. I prep all the ingredients for the mushroom pasta and get everything in the Dutch oven for the chili by the time A. gets home. We have Manhattans again and I hear all about his session, which sounds like it went super well.

6 p.m. -- The sauce comes together quickly for the mushroom pasta. I'm a bit nervous to cook the fresh pasta, as I'm not sure what to expect, and unfortunately it doesn't unfurl from its little nests as beautifully as I had hoped it would. Nevertheless, it tastes amazing, and we have a little fresh parm over it.

8 p.m. -- We turn the Steelers game on and eat the pumpkin pie over halftime. It's a late game and I also don't care a whole lot about it, so I go to bed when I'm sleepy.

7 a.m. -- My alarm goes off. I go about packing my lunch and make it onto the 7:45 a.m. bus.

8:30 a.m. -- I need to get better at drinking water, so I have a full glass, and then I make fresh coffee and eat some of the breakfast casserole A. made yesterday instead of going straight to my laptop.

10:45 a.m. -- I finish up a conference call and then eat a banana and drink more water.

1:05 p.m. -- I check my bank account and move $7.63 to my other checking. First business day of the month stinks: All the bills are coming out today! I'm in good shape, though. I heat up my lunch and take a break from my screens for a while.

3:45 p.m. -- Afternoon lull. I snack on my clementines while on mute on a conference call and drink some green tea. I'm not really needed on this call, so I use some Amazon credit to buy a Kindle book: What If This Were Enough? by Heather Havrilesky. I am not familiar with her, but it seems like my style. $5.48

5:30 p.m. -- Head home. A. just got out of the studio and is able to pick me up at the T station, so I don't have to walk home in the crappy weather. We make guac and have the salsa chicken he made this morning with corn tortillas.

7:30 a.m. -- Wake up and do my morning routine as usual. I drop A. off at the station. (I drive on Tuesdays because I see my therapist in the evening.)

9:15 a.m. -- Settle into the day at work. I check my bank account first and move $5.07 to my other checking. For breakfast, I eat a grapefruit and some breakfast enchilada casserole.

12:45 p.m. -- This day is flying by -- I have been moving around a lot getting items shipped to the sales reps. I heat up chili for lunch and catch up on the internet. I'm super excited to see NPR voted my favorite album of 2018, Be the Cowboy by Mitski, as #2 for 2018!

5:45 p.m. -- I decide to check out a local bookstore for a book written by a local gal I heard on a podcast. I get flustered trying to park in that part of town, and they don't have the book anyway.

6:30 p.m. -- Make it just in time for therapy, where my doctor hands me a statement I've been dreading. He sometimes gets behind on his billing and he's pretty old-school and only accepts check payment. This would have hurt me more in the past, but I've been setting my copays aside after each session, so I'm ready for it. $225

8:10 p.m. -- Make it home. I'm annoyed to see my apartment lot is full, even though we're all guaranteed a spot. I back out to try to find street parking, when there is a thud and crunch. To my absolute horror, I've backed right into a car parked on the street across from the lot. I see A. in the window looking at me and I gesture for him to come outside.

8:45 p.m. -- We wait a bit for the owner of the car, and I cry a lot. I've never had an accident before. A. is completely cool and calm, isn't upset with me at all, and talks me through what needs to be done. All the houses around us are dark, so it's not clear where the car owner might be. Our bumper is totally fine, but the backdoor of the other car is crunched. We leave a note with our number and plate number, and put it in a sandwich baggy under the windshield in case it rains overnight. Inside, A. starts the incident report on the insurance site. He owns the plan and I'm covered on it.

9:15 p.m. -- The owner calls and doesn't sound angry. We finally have a little dinner and a whiskey after the drama of the night and watch some TV before bed.

7 a.m. -- I have a meeting this morning at 9. I'd usually drive, but I still feel bad about last night, so I plan to take the early bus. I set out A.'s lunch and pack my own.

9:30 a.m. -- Meeting ends. I have a banana and eat a piece of focaccia toast from our Strip District adventure. I check in with A. and he still hasn't heard from his insurance agent.

11:45 a.m. -- I get some busy work cranked out to distract myself from the car. Then I check my bank account and move $5 to my other checking. A. isn't sure what his deductible is, but I plan to pay in full for this accident. I'm worried it will be $1,000 and I will lose almost my entire emergency fund. (But that's why I have it.) I am planning to be consumer debt-free by February, but maybe now this will have to get pushed back a few months. I affirm to myself that I have worked hard on my financial goals and have made good financial decisions in 2018 to get out of debt. I will be able to rebuild that emergency fund easily if it does get completely depleted, even if it means a slight postponement of my ultimate goal.

1:15 p.m. -- I need a grilled cheese. I abandon my prepared lunch and get one from a cafe, plus a can of Diet Coke. FEELINGS. $5.63

3:45 p.m. -- A. gets back to me. Amazingly, since his car wasn't damaged, no deductible is owed. The insurance accepts responsibility. He also has accident forgiveness, and his rate won't go up. I cry with relief, but feel like there should still be some consequence. We discuss splitting the premium.

5:45 p.m. -- Dinner is salsa chicken. The mood is cheerful after the good news from the insurance agent. We have a quiet evening doing our own reading and internet-ing until bed."

Written by Javier C. Hernández

For months, Gu Baoluo had been looking forward to a boisterous Christmas celebration at one of China's best-known Protestant churches. He loved decorating trees, singing songs like ""Silent Night"" and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.

But in early December, the police shut down Gu's usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu as part of what activists said is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated Bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain's outspoken pastor on charges of ""inciting subversion,"" punishable in serious cases by at least five years in prison.

On Christmas Eve, Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend's home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.

""We will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,"" Gu said.

As millions around the world gathered to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.

Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party's dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party's control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.

The campaign comes as Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.

Renee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the ""heart of the underground Christian resistance."" The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party's grip on society.

""The message,"" Xia said, ""is that Xi can't be messed with.""

The crackdown has escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshippers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closure of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.

The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.

Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China's fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China's authoritarian government and Xi's embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.

But the government's heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.

On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain's former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.

Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. ""We have moved underground,"" he said.

Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church's former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.

Wang, in a pre-written message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.

""The Communist regime's persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,"" he wrote. ""As a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.""

Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled, ""The God Who Bestows Peace."" Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.

At Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.

A children's choir sang ""Silent Night,"" and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.

The anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.

""If you see the police, national security or community workers greet them with gentleness,"" Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. ""If they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.""

While he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Wen asked those in attendance to remember ""those who are criminally detained."" Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.

Since Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches between 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.

This year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from ""The Nutcracker"" plays in the background at malls.

Officials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government's efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.

""China's Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.

But China's growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.

One notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.

Despite Xi's efforts to expand the officially atheist party's control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing. While official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshipping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.

Independent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.

While sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.

Early Rain, which Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Wang called Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.

Gu, the rice seller, began attending services at Early Rain two years ago after finding videos of Wang's fiery sermons online. He felt Wang's concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Gu was baptized last year.

""I saw injustices in society,"" Gu said. ""I saw that the government's promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.""

Worried for his own safety, Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.

Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: ""The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day."""

The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company toward ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions.""

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

A PURGE

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

LOYALIST

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

""MALICE""

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions."""

In an article written for the Sangh mouthpiece Organiser, Vaidya praised the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan founder ahead of his birth anniversary on December 30. Acknowledging that the Somnath Temple and Ram Temple issues are different, Vaidya wrote: ""The Supreme Court's decision to not expedite the Ram Mandir case reminded me of a debate that took place in 1948 about the reconstruction of Somnath Mandir -- a magnificent temple destroyed by the Muslim invaders.""

Munshi's debate with Nehru over the Somnath Temple was recorded by the former in his book Pilgrimage to Freedom, which Vaidya elaborately cites in the article. ""Despite opposition from Pandit Nehru, Somnath was rebuilt and today the shrine attracts lakhs of devotees from across the world,"" Vaidya said.

The reconstruction of the Somnath Temple was initiated by Sardar Patel, then home minister, and was executed by KM Munshi, a cabinet minister in the central government. It was inaugurated by then president of India Dr Rajendra Prasad.

Vaidya writes that when Munshi went on a ""sort of pilgrimage to the broken shrine"" in December 1922, he saw it ""desecrated, burnt and battered"".

""It still stood firm -- a monument to our humiliation and ingratitude. I can scarcely describe the burning shame, which I felt on that early morning as I walked on the broken floor of the once-hallowed Sabha mandap..."" Munshi wrote.

Sardar Patel and Pandit Nehru on Somanth

As per the account of KM Munshi that Vaidya discussed in the article, in November 1947, Sardar Patel visited the temple. At a public meeting, he announced, ""On this auspicious day of the New Year, we have decided that Somnath should be reconstructed. You, people of Saurashtra, should do your best.""

Munshi also wrote about Nehru in his papers. ""The temple of Somnath is not just an ancient monument; it lived in the hearts of the whole nation and its reconstruction was a national pledge. But Jawaharlal called me and said, 'I don't like your trying to restore Somnath. It is Hindu revivalism'.""

In his article, Vaidya writes that the difference of opinion between Patel, Munshi and Nehru is illustrative of ""two different ideas of Bharat"".

""Pandit Nehru was not anti-Bharat but his idea of Bharat was rooted in a Eurocentric school of thought. On the other side was an idea of Bharat rooted in this soil and our ancient spiritual tradition,"" he writes.

Munshi's Response to Nehru

In his response to Nehru, Munshi wrote: ""When the whole scheme was discussed by Sardar with Bapu, he stated that it was alright except that the funds necessary for reconstructing the temple should come from the public. Thereafter, the idea that the Government of India should finance the reconstruction of the temple was given up.

""You pointedly referred to me in the cabinet as connected with Somnath. I am glad you did so; for I do not want to keep back any part of my views or activities, particularly from you who have placed such abundant confidence in me all these months. I have helped in building up several institutions. If similarly I am now helping to build Somnath as a center of religion (Dharma) and culture, a university and a farm, it is only as a humble task to which I have been called...I can assure you that the 'Collective Sub conscious' of India today is happier with the scheme of reconstruction of Somnath sponsored by Government of India than with many other things that we have done and are doing,"" Munshi wrote.

Replying to then PM's 'Hindu revivalism' remark, Munshi said: ""I know your views on the subject; I have always done justice to them; I hope you will equally do justice to mine. Many have been the customs, which I have defied in my humble way through literary and social work to shape or reintegrate some aspects of Hinduism, in the conviction that that alone will make India an advanced and vigorous nation under modern conditions.""

The reply to Munshi came from VP Menon, who was then advisor to the States Ministry. ""I have seen your masterpiece. I for one would be prepared to live and, if necessary, die by the views you have expressed in your letter.""

And so the reconstruction of Somnath Temple went ahead. When the time came to install the deity, Munshi approached Dr Rajendra Prasad and asked him to perform the ceremony, but added a rider -- he should accept it ""only if he was prepared not to fail us"".

Munshi wrote, ""He promised that he would come and install the deity whatever the attitude of the Prime Minister because he 'would do the same with a mosque or a church if I were invited'.""

Claiming that Nehru ""vehemently protested"" Prasad's acceptance of Munshi's invite, Vaidya said that even the president's speech was censored out of the official organs. ""It is ironical that Nehru, the Indian icon of liberalism and freedom of expression, should make sure that the speech of the President is censored. In this manner despite opposition Somnath was rebuilt and today the magnificent shrine attracts lakhs of devotees from across the world,"" Vaidya writes.

""History is repeating itself and the opposition to the Ram Temple in Ayodhya is even more vocal,"" Vaidya added."

As 2018 Ends, Here's A Look at World Women Leaders Who Inspire Us | LatestLY","Latestly",FALSE,"As the world was confronted with the #MeToo movement in 2018 where women challenged the abuse of power by men, some women assumed positions of power themselves in what can be called baby steps towards gender equality. Let's look at the women who are leading their respective countries as heads of government and heads of state.

In India's immediate neighbourhood, three countries have women at their helm.

Bangladesh has been led by Sheikh Hasina, the 10 and longest-serving prime minister of the country. She is the daughter of Bangladesh's first president Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who led the fight for the country's liberation from Pakistan.

Her time in power has seen Bangladesh notch record high economic growth averaging over 6%. Its GDP per head is now higher than Pakistan's, when measured at market exchange rates. It also boasts a lower infant mortality rate, higher school enrolment and longer life expectancy than its neighbours.

She has outmanoeuvred her long-time political opponent Khaleda Zia who has been barred from contesting in the upcoming general elections.

Her political achievement has been noted globally as Forbes ranked her 26 on its 2018 List of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women.

Nepal's current president is a woman who by dint of her position is also the commander-in-chief of the country's armed forces. She is the first woman to hold this office in Nepal. She was first elected as President in a parliamentary vote in 2015 and was re-elected for a second term earlier this year in March.

She has also been the Minister of defence, again becoming the first woman to hold the position in Nepal.

Bhandari began her political career as a Leftist student union member through which she joined the Communist Party of Nepal - Marxist-Leninist in 1980. She has over three decades of experience as a political activist in Nepal.

Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's party National League for Democracy won a landslide victory in 2015 and she was named State Counsellor as she is constitutionally barred from becoming president due to her marriage to a non-Burmese national. Her post is akin to a prime minister.

Suu Kyi for long was touted as a beacon of democracy and was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1991, as ""an outstanding example of the power of the powerless"".

She spent almost 15 years under house arrest for her efforts to bring democracy to then military-ruled Myanmar. Her unwavering effort towards democracy made her an international symbol of peaceful resistance in the face of armed oppression.

However, after assuming power Myanmar's military junta's action against the Rohingya people which has in effect made them a stateless people has brought the world's censure on Suu Kyi silence for her continued silence on the issue. This year Canada withdrew its honorary citizenship to Aung San Suu Kyi as the situation in Myanmar has deteriorated with the government doing nothing to protect Rohingya and other minority populations.

The United Kingdom currently has two women at its helm. The country is a constitutional monarchy which means that while the Sovereign - Queen Elizabeth II is the head of state, the power of legislation is wielded by the Parliament headed by the prime minister.

Queen Elizabeth II, ascended the throne on the death of her father, King George VI, on 6 February 1952. She is commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces.

Apart from being the monarch of the UK, Queen Elizabeth II is also the monarch of 15 Commonwealth countries including Canada, Australia and New Zealand. She is also the head of the grouping Commonwealth of Nations.

Theresa May is the prime minister of UK and gained her post after she won the leadership of her party after David Cameron resigned following the pro-Brexit vote.

She is managing a minority government and was the UK's longest serving home minister before attaining her current position. She is Britain's second female prime minister.

May currently has the unenviable task of negotiating the country's exit from the European Union.

Angela Merkel has served as Germany's Chancellor since 2005. She has been the leader of Germany's centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) since 2000 but gave up this position in 2018. She also announced she would not stand for re-election as chancellor in 2021.

Merkel has been widely described as the de facto leader of the European Union as she has been a constant presence as the economic grouping and the world at large witnessed an economic meltdown in 2008, a refugee crisis in 2015 and an impending Brexit - as the UK becomes the first country to leave the EU.

She was named the TIME's most powerful woman in 2015 and has frequently appeared on the Forbes' list of The World's 100 most powerful women. In her profile, TIME says of her, ""No one in Europe has held office longer -- or to greater effect -- in a world defined by steadily receding barriers.""

Sirleaf was Africa's first elected female Head of State and is known as Liberia's Iron Lady. A Harvard alumni and having worked with corporate banks, Sirleaf came back to Liberia despite being threatened and driven out of the country.

In 2011, Sirleaf was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for her non-violent struggle for the safety of women and for women's rights to full participation in peace-building work.""

She is credited with keeping peace after a decade-long war which saw more than two lakh Liberians die and more than 15 lakh abandon their country.

Many accuse of her of being corrupt and not doing enough for women but her 12 years in power saw her stabilise the country's economy which had been wracked by misgovernance and international sanctions.

She stepped down from her position this year but was expelled from her party just days before her term came to an end.

Zewde is the first woman to hold the office of the President in Ethiopia and currently the only female serving head of state in Africa. She has had a distinguished career as an international diplomat having served as Special Representative of United Nations to the African Union and Head of the United Nations Office to the African Union at the level of Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations.

Tsai Ing-wen is a Taiwanese politician, and former attorney who has been Taiwan's president from May 2016. She was the first woman to be elected to the office in Taiwan. She is also the first person to have never held an elected executive post before presidency and the first to be popularly elected without having previously served as the Mayor of Taipei.

She supports an independent Taiwan political view and has made efforts to increase the country's ties to the U.S.

Singapore swore in its first woman president and its 8 - Halimah Yacob on 14 September 2017. She was the country's ninth Speaker of Parliament and was again the first woman to hold the position.

In her long and illustrious political career, Halimah represented Singapore in the Geneva-based International Labour Organisation for 12 years, the first Singaporean to be elected into the ILO.

In the media, she is referred to as a ""down-to-earth"" president with a ""common-touch."" She owes her simple and unassuming demeanour to her humble origins. In her own words, she describes her childhood as being 'poor' and being her mother's helper - She writes about her upbringing, ""From the age of 10, my hours outside of school were spent being my mother's assistant: cleaning, washing, clearing tables and serving customers, and I am a better person for it.""

She adds, ""I have experienced poverty first-hand and know how debilitating it can be as you struggle to survive, to put food on the table and also grapple with the uncertainty of the future on a daily basis...It limits your choices but also tempers your determination to succeed. My priority then was to finish school, get a job and support my mother.""

Jacinda Kate Laurell Ardern is the world's youngest female head of government, becoming prime minister at the age of 37. Giving birth to a daughter on 21 June 2018, Ardern became the world's second elected head of government to give birth while in office.

Her rise in New Zealand from an MP to becoming the youngest-ever leader of New Zealand's Labour Party, was so meteoric that it earned a name: Jacindamania.

She has not shied away from combining her identity of being a female and a leader as she brought her baby and husband to the United Nations General Assembly. The baby's presence at the UNGA led to the creation of a special UN pass for Neve Te Aroha."

The B.Des at JKLU is a 4-year full-time, graduate degree programme, recognized by UGC, Government of India. The Programme provides an opportunity for students to experience industry in their classroom, making them ready to create experiences for people once they complete the program.

To complement its programmes in Engineering, Technology and Business Management,the B.Des degree at the much acclaimed Jaipur-based academic institution will provide specialisations in product design, interaction design and interdisciplinary design.

""We are aiming to bring about a fresh, new, approach to design education, which is collaborative in nature and integrative in process. It is both unique and relevant for the neo-designer, somebody who is at-ease working in the studios, experimenting at the labs and in presenting at board rooms. To achieve this, we are re-imagining the curriculum to make way for new skills, new methods of working, and new pedagogy. The programmes are curated such that they can transform the students into designers who are future-ready and adaptive. Creating a new paradigm in design education, JK Lakshmipat University has set to break the conventional design ideology that works on aesthetics to step on towards a contemporary ideology revolving around sustainability and user experience."" says Prof. A Balaubramaniam, Dean, Institute of Design, JK Lakshmipat University while throwing light on the design education a student will get at the University.

The launch of the institute was marked by Dr. R.L. Raina , Vice Chancellor, JK Lakshmipat University where Mr. Jay Dutta, Sr Vice President-User Experience, MakeMyTrip Group, Bangalore, addressed the audience through Skype.

The inauguration ceremony has also been followed by the addresses of Mr. Abhimanyu Nohwar , Product Designer; Founder & Principal Designer, Kiba Design, Noida andSanjeev Bothra Educator & Researcher, Appropriate Design, Jaipur

On the occasion of launch Mr. Asheesh Gupta, Pro Vice Chancellor , JKLU added that with experiential learning already at the core of its Institute of Engineering & Technology and Institute of Management, the introduction of the Institute of Design comes as an initiative that can bridge and fuse all the three disciplines. The design curriculum at JKLU sits at the cross roads of technology, business, society, culture and people. Designers, therefore, need to be aware, if not proficient in all the sectors. To do that, designers will be building a mindset that is broad and agile, during the course.

Created by one of the most well-known names of the Indian design industry Prof. A. Balasubramanian , the design courses at JKLU ensure an academically-enriched yet industrially-relevant learning for its students joining in the academic year 2019.

It is focused at making the students creative, mature, independent, empathetic, sensitive, conscious, resourceful and communicative designers.

Not only the students will share their learning journey, but also get an opportunity to be assessed by their peers, along with being evaluated by the industry experts in the end of each semester. While learning design at JKLU, the students will have the liberty to choose their own subjects, thus making them independent and in complete control of their programme .

The country today needs a new generation of user-centric and empathetic professionals who can look into the need of the consumers and bring it to reality, and JKLU is ideally placed to do this. JKLU aims to nurture and create sensitive designers, who can envision and accept the future, and not just become job-ready graduates. Hence, it has not only reimagined the design sphere, but has also reinvented it to suit the needs of the changing trends of the industry.

The B.Des programme at JKLU has been designed by one of the most known faces of Design in India with a good blend of academics, industry exposure and personal mentoring by industry professionals."

Hindu extremists have attacked a Sunday school in Tamil Nadu and threatened the children.

A mob of some 300 Hindu extremists on Nov. 11 barged into the school in Amathur village, Virudhunagar District, and demanded Pastor Selva Raj who was leading a worship service to vacate the building immediately.

The mob destroyed a shed in front of the building and began threatening the Sunday school children in foul language, said Raj.

""They took away the Bible storybooks and some song and activity books from the children and tore them into pieces,"" he told Morning Star News.

""They scared the children away by telling them that they will be beaten up if they are seen in the church premises ever again,"" he added.

They demanded him to promise in writing that he would leave the village and never return.

The police had joined forces with the mob to vacate the school, Raj said adding that police arrived at the spot and forced him to the police station.

""The building owner is under severe pressure from the Hindu Munnani,"" said Raj.

""He told us that he can't extend our period of stay, and that we must vacate. The Hindu villagers are reluctant to rent out even a small room for us,"" he added.

Despite the threats, Raj tries to gather the children for Sunday school.

""I'm ready to become martyr for Christ,"" he said.

""Until my Lord provides us a building, we will continue serving the Lord. It is fine even if we do not have shelter, we will not stop worshipping Him. We are ready to die for Christ,"" he added."

Some are so obvious you'll kick yourself for not already doing them, and others are so weird you just have to try them.

Only answer email once or twice a day

From Kara Cutruzzula, who writes a fantastic daily newsletter about work, productivity and life in general:

What's the most efficient way to fill a water glass? Turning the tap one centimeter and letting a slow drip top you off? Of course not. You crank that faucet and let the water flow.

That's what batching emails feels like. Instead of responding one at a time to the forever trickle of your inbox, email batching -- responding to as many as possible during a specific time frame -- is incredibly satisfying.

One of my resolutions this year was to spend less of my life in Gmail. Solution? Now I answer emails twice a day, first around noon and then again at 6 p.m. Knowing I have to get through dozens of important messages makes my replies quicker and crisper; I can also delete the ultimate enemy (junk mail) all at once. Plus, there's a sense of accomplishment in setting discrete boundaries on an infinite task. Batching emails is like finding the end of pi.

Of course, this idea doesn't hold water if your job demands immediate responses, but it's still possible to jump on messages that are urgent, and to corral less important messages for later in the day. Give it a shot!

Quit being the flaky friend; it's not cute

From freelance writer Rae Witte:

We all have one. They say yes to everything, they never mean it and when they do show up, they're late.

While they may waver on whether they back out last minute, or simply don't show at all, they consistently do not follow through with plans they've agreed to or even initiated. Their aloofness makes you question whether you can depend on them for anything, whether it's grabbing dinner or picking up your call when you need them.

Flaky friends suck. Don't be the flaky friend. If you are, stop.

There are two keys to freeing yourself from flaky friend status: self-awareness and learning to say no.

First, examine why you say yes to things you have no intention of following through on. Is it poor time management? Do you have crippling social anxiety? Do you hate disappointing people? Do you struggle with saying no to people?

Once you've determined why you flake, the fun begins: Say no, assertively and often. Happy hour? No. Spin class? Pass. Dinner reservations for 10 p.m.? Not happening. Find comfort in declining invites and doing exactly whatever you do when you flake. Conversely, try very hard to agree only to things you will actually show up to and go on time.

Here's some advice on learning to say no effectively.

By building on this foundation of newfound self-awareness and comfort in saying no and holding yourself accountable, you'll be able to shed your flaky skin. (Ew. But, seriously.)

Try a tipsy grocery store shopping trip

From Beca Grimm, a writer in Atlanta and co-founder of Dope Girls:

Here's a miracle of modern life I recently discovered: grocery store bars. Yes, bars in the grocery store. Stick with me.

Finding time to maintain friendships as an adult only gets harder as we age. Family and work obligations often take precedence over other relationships, so one of the keys to fitting socialization into a slammed schedule is to find ways to hit multiple activities at a time.

Here's my secret: Invite pals to join you for chores you're obligated to tackle, like grocery shopping.

Everyone's gotta eat, right? More supermarkets across the country now feature bars, sometimes serving only beer and wine, but that's just fine. These watering holes -- like what's colloquially known in my city of Atlanta as ""KroBar"" (formally Kroger Marketplace at Glenwood) -- serve as a super convenient meeting place for you to down a healthy pour of house Malbec and catch up with another busy friend before you both tend to your respective shopping lists.

Grocery-based bars are unpretentious; even in a Whole Foods bar featuring 16 craft beer taps, it's unlikely you'd also find Edison bulbs buzzing over patrons. What could be better: booze, buds and tending to the foundation of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, all at once.

And really, who wouldn't find delight in navigating an aisle with a shopping cart and a light buzz?

Can't make the party? Don't apologize

From Scaachi Koul, a writer and author of the book ""One Day We'll All Be Dead And None Of This Will Matter"":

There is no greater joy in this world than being unable to go to a get-together, a baby shower, a gender reveal, an engagement party or a karaoke party. Most people secretly love canceling plans, so when you do invariably bail, enjoy it and, most important: Don't send that message apologizing for your absence.

There are limits to this. If you're expected at a dinner where the table is reserved for a certain number, you have to tell someone you're not coming. But if it's a gathering of any size larger than what one might describe as intimate, your silence is the best gift.

No one cares that you can't come! Really! Unless you're the mother of the bride, the birthday boy, the pallbearer or the accused, it's unlikely anyone will even notice you didn't show up.

In fact, sending apologies for not attending an event gives the host more responsibility: Not only do they have to put out an appropriate cheese spread and make sure no one spills wine on their hosting slippers, they have to accommodate your excuse and apology.

Just stay home, don't send the ""omg so sorry but I have work!!!"" lie-text, and sit in the dark, silent, hoping people keep inviting you to things you don't want to attend.

Don't worry about leaving the house at the same time as your partner

From Rachel Sugar, a writer in Brooklyn:

I dislike being rushed. I leave for the airport early, and I like to be at the movies with time to spare.

It's not because I am a punctual person by nature -- I am not -- but rather because I am both slow and easily stressed. Part of adulthood is knowing oneself, and what I have learned so far is that, under pressure, I am happiest moving at the pace of an arthritic retriever.

My boyfriend is the opposite. He loves rushing. The more rushed, the better, he says. He walks at a respectable marathon pace. He loves the thrill of impossibly tight train connections, because it makes him ""feel like Jason Bourne.""

For years, this was a source of tension. Then we discovered the answer: Leave at different times. ""I'm going to get a head start!"" I'll say, and leave for the restaurant, while my boyfriend is still showering. And then I go, at my pace -- a pace ideal for noticing new storefronts, or attractive dogs -- and he shows up at his pace, and no one is angry or stressed or secretly resentful.

When we tell friends about our system, they are often baffled: You leave at ... different times? To go to ... the same place? Yes. That is exactly what we do. And you can, too! It is even (sort of) romantic, in a way. As the old saying goes: If you love something, set it free and then meet it at the movies.

Some fights are necessary; what time to leave is not one of them.

Order a cocktail without annoying the bartender

From Leigh Kunkel, a food and drink writer and former bartender in Chicago:

You know the feeling: a bartender places an intimidating cocktail menu in front of you with words you've never heard before. Panicked, you want to order something you think will be simple, giving the bartender few instructions so she can simply work her magic.

""Can I just have something with gin?"" you ask. Or something ""strong."" Or worse yet, the phrase every bartender hates: ""not sweet,"" which can mean anything from ""I love citrus but not strawberry"" to ""I really just want cold vodka in a glass,"" making it impossible to tell what you truly want.

Instead of asking your bartender to read your mind to discern your tastes, try reversing your thought process: What do you like in a drink? Things like ""tropical"" or ""spirit-forward"" give the bartender much more to work with, because they indicate flavor profiles that can be developed in multiple different ways, from spirit choice to the addition of syrups and bitters.

Style is also essential: If you don't like the bitter, boozy gin Negroni, you might still love another gin cocktail, like an easy-drinking gimlet. If you tell your bartender that you love ginger beer, she'll likely steer you toward a Moscow Mule or a Dark and Stormy; if you use words like ""bubbly"" or ""effervescent,"" she'll know that an Air Mail is a safe bet.

When all else fails, use this simple formula: strength + flavor. For example, ""I'd like something light and tart,"" or ""I'm looking for a strong, herbaceous drink."" Just a few extra words will make your night -- and your bartender's -- much more enjoyable.

Listen to video game music while you work (really!)

From Angelica Frey, a writer in Brooklyn by way of Milan:

You know when you just can't stick to a task that takes deep concentration because you keep getting distracted? Here's something that might help: music, but not the often-recommended Mozart or Beethoven.

Rather, my solution is video game music, which is designed to help players remain involved in singular task for an extended period of time. The melodies are pleasant to the ear but, crucially, not overbearing. Just like I've endured training my characters for more than an hour listening to the same tune, with video game music I can stick to the most boring aspects of my work for extended bursts of concentration. This is my recipe:

Choose between ambient and rhythmic

Whether you prefer atmospheric or rhythmic tracks, video game music offers great options for both categories. I'm a fan of melodies with a slight ""oompah,"" as they give my workflow a rhythm to follow. Here is one of my favorites, and here are some other great options: Waltz for The Moon (rhythmic), Star Maze (rhythmic), Forest Interlude (ambient) and Arrival (ambient).

Find tracks you associate with good memories

Pavlovian reflex comes into play here. Water themes can be beautiful, but they remind me of depleted oxygen bars. Mid-tempo tracks of grassland, beach and sometimes desert levels put me in the right mind-set. Here are some examples of those: Artisans Home, The Road of Trials and Gerudo Valley.

Take these melodies beyond your desk!

If you're looking to fuel your workout with video game tracks, here are the best places to start: Rainbow Road, Wake Up, Get Up, Get Out There and Slider (for that final sprint).

Just be a better listener

From Jen Soong, a writer in Davis, Calif.

Good listeners are far and few between, and the endless distractions calling us away from conversation -- hello, smartphones -- aren't helping.

""When we fail to listen to one another, we can't reach any meaningful dialogue or resolution,"" said Dr. Helen Riess, founder of Empathetics and an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.

Disturbed by a listening deficit in hospitals, Dr. Riess developed a program to teach doctors how to better tune into their patients and save lives. Here, she shares simple strategies from ""The Empathy Effect"" to hone your empathetic listening skills at work and at home.

Mind your body. Make eye contact and maintain your gaze. Keep your face relaxed and lean slightly forward to show you're alert and attuned to the conversation. Open postures convey approachability. Don't cross your arms, as that can be seen as being defensive. Be receptive by adopting a quiet, inviting tone of voice.

Be an emotion detective. Pay attention to people's faces because they provide a road map of emotions. Subtle signs like a raised eyebrow or lip turn can reveal feelings of disgust, anxiety and joy. If you don't watch closely, you can miss important clues to their state of mind.

Make a connection. Be present, ask open-ended questions and most importantly, don't interrupt. Show genuine curiosity in the story being shared. After all, as humans, we all want to be heard.

So go ahead, put down your phone and have a real conversation. Doctor's orders."

URBAN RENAISSANCE:REJUVENATING & TRANSFORMINGINDIAN CITIES, BEING ACHIEVED THROUGHINFUSION OF MORE THAN RS.6,85,758 CRORE

The Ministry of Housing & Urban Affairs has embarked upon one of the most ambitious programmes undertaken in the world for Urban renaissance for rejuvenating and transforming Indian cities through a number of initiatives including infusion of more than Rs. 6,85,758 crore for ensuring citizen friendly urban areas. The transformation has been undertaken by way of implementing key urban reforms, projects for urban rejuvenation among others besidesapproving implementation of city HRIDAY plans for 12 cities.

NATIONAL HERITAGE CITY DEVELOPMENT AND AUGMENTATION YOJANA (HRIDAY)

The National Heritage City Development and Augmentation Yojana (HRIDAY), launched on 21 January, 2015, is being implemented in 12 cities, namely, Ajmer, Amaravati, Amritsar, Badami, Dwaraka, Gaya, Kancheepuram, Mathura, Puri, Varanasi, Velankanni and Warangal.

In 2018, 20 projects amounting to Rs. 140.14 Crores have been completed in the cities of Ajmer, Amaravati, Amritsar, Badami, Dwaraka, Puri and Varanasi. Few notable projects completed in 2018 are as follows:

The projects considered under the scheme will deliver assets catering to civic infrastructure which will enhance the experience of residents and tourist with essence of heritage character of the city. Since the assets created under the scheme having direct interface with public, Sustainability is the most important success factor in achieving the goal. In addition to that, Proper operation and maintenance is essential to maximizing the environmental, social, and economic benefits of assets created, as well as ensuring that projects perform as expected.

A segment of the fortification wall houses, above it, a colonial period building which houses a 100-year-old Municipal Printing Press and a school. On the outset, the project aimed to address the structural conservation of the entire complex which was in an extremely poor condition. The project aimed to undertake the conservation and revitalization in a manner so that the cultural edifices impact the quality of lives of the users and hence reintegrates the significance of the building into the lives of the local community.

Initially all the five classes were running out of two run down rooms. The project reorganized the spaces within the building into five classrooms and provided verandahs for children for extracurricular activities. Toilets and kitchen were upgraded. A room was provided for the teachers as well. Facilities for play were provided in the open area including games as snakes and ladders etc.

The Rambagh gate was restored to house a 'Peoples' Museum' locally called the Lok Virsa thus providing a cultural space for the community which showcases the historical and cultural narrative of the city of Amritsar and its people using art installations, films and information boards and graphics.

The Municipal Printing Press and has been provided with improved building infrastructure and services for continued use as a printing press. It is important to note here that Dhani Ram Chatrik, a Punjabi poet and typographer standardized the typeset for Gurmukhi typeset too came from city of Amritsar and this Municipal Printing Press could commemorate his contribution.

The completion of this project has revived the historically significant Town Hall building and provided the citizens of Varanasi with an additional location for socio-cultural activities.

However, since development along the beach is only concentrated in few spots, this leads to overcrowding during peak season. Hence, with the objective of developing alternate tourist spots along the Puri Beach, this project was undertaken.

The scope of work included Construction of boundary walls, provision of Landscapes, Garden paths, creation of Amphitheatre, Garden lights, Fountain and automatic sprinklers, Plantation of saline resistant plants, furniture, drinking water stations, toilets etc. The project was completed in September, 2018. The project has helped in reducing the concentration of tourists in certain spots, improved the greenery along the beach and improved the overall environment of the area"

From its hillside overlooking the Ethiopian capital, Berhanu Mengistu's century-old, gabled family home has seen emperors and governments rise and fall. (AFP)

From its hillside overlooking the Ethiopian capital, Berhanu Mengistu's century-old, gabled family home has seen emperors and governments rise and fall.

It has withstood economic stagnation and the rapid population growth that replaced its once-patrician neighbours with a rabble of shacks.

But it now stands lonely in a field of weeds, the house's corrugated roof and red plaster walls stark against a fast-changing cityscape of cleared slums, tower cranes and glinting high rises.

Palatial homes like Berhanu's are scattered throughout Addis Ababa, built for imperial-era courtiers and foreign business moguls, but most have slid into dire neglect as the government focuses on an aspirational building boom.

""Nowadays, most of the buildings you see are more of the European architecture,"" said Berhanu, a supply chain manager whose house has been in his family for seven generations.

Across the capital, older, poorer neighbourhoods -- like the one that once surrounded Berhanu's home -- have been levelled to make way for glass-and-concrete towers, lauded by the government as a symbol of the rapid economic expansion transforming one of Africa's poorest countries.

But preservationists worry that the breakneck development comes at the cost of the capital's architectural heritage.

""There are isolated efforts of protecting, saving historic buildings, but it's really very limited,"" said Fasil Giorghis, a well-known architect.

""It is not even a given that you should protect a historic building.""

A young city

Addis Ababa was founded in the late 19th century by Emperor Menelik II as he expanded the Ethiopian empire from the country's northern highlands to its modern boundaries.

The young city soon filled with houses belonging to members of Menelik's government, among them Berhanu's ancestor Yemtu Beznash, the family matriarch and administrator of a powerful law court.

Menelik, who died in 1913, also hired Armenians as city engineers, while merchants came from India and Yemen.

That cosmopolitanism was upended in 1974 with the arrival of the Derg military junta, which dismantled the Ethiopian empire.

Fasil recounted how, as foreign traders fled, the communist-leaning Derg handed their former mansions to poor tenants, who could not afford to maintain the earthen walls and wooden floors.

'Ideological shift'

The Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF), which evicted the Derg in 1991 and continues to rule today, has presided over an economic boom.

This has seen contractors from China and elsewhere set to work on half-built skyscrapers that give the capital's skyline a jagged, unfinished feel.

Maheder Gebremedhin, an architect who hosts a radio show discussing the trade, says the neglect of the old buildings is due to the cost and complexity of renovation, as well as a lingering ambivalence towards the imperial past.

""Because of the ideological shift, there is not a real interest to keep these buildings,"" Maheder said.

Heritage, abandoned

Government and private donors have successfully restored a handful of buildings, including one of Menelik's palaces and the mansion of a former defence minister that's been converted into a museum.

But city authorities acknowledge that most of the 440 buildings that have been designated heritage sites are rundown.

""Because of our capacity as a developing country, they can't be repaired all the time,"" said Worku Mengesha, a spokesman for Addis Ababa's tourism office.

A decade ago, foreign embassies and Ethiopian preservationists tried to restore the Mohammadali house, once the property of a wealthy Indian businessman featuring prominent Indian and Arabian architectural elements in addition to its imperial-era Ethiopian style.

However, bureaucracy and shoddy construction scuppered the effort, Fasil said.

As a result, it is padlocked and abandoned, with parked cars sheltering beneath its Indian-inspired arches and a pair of discarded trousers draped across its faded cream staircase.

Other historic buildings continue in their Derg-era role of housing for the poor, or in their slow decrepitude.

The expansive former palace of Hojele Al-Hassen, a wealthy traditional ruler during the Menelik era, still houses people from his western region, who spend after-work hours socialising on the wraparound veranda.

But it's increasingly dilapidated, with an entire decaying wing that once served as a school classroom sealed off for safety.

Family history, city history

Three years ago, as city authorities levelled the homes that had mushroomed around Berhanu's house, he kept the bulldozers at bay by having his home designated an historic building.

Berhanu now hopes to turn his family history into national history.

Standing near a large portrait of the matriarch Yemtu, he spoke of his dream to make a museum of the house whose rooms are filled with family photographs and heirlooms, including a wall-spanning snake skin.

""This is not only our property. It belongs to all Ethiopians and people of Addis Ababa,"" he said.

He hopes the city will agree.

Across the street in the slum area the government wants cleared, his neighbour Solomon Damana had recently resolved a dispute with city authorities and was following orders to demolish the small family home in which he was born and raised and move to a one-bedroom apartment on the outskirts of town.

""I'm happy that one isn't demolished,"" he said, gesturing at Berhanu's place. ""It's an historic house."""

Venezuela saw bloody protests in 2018 and January 20 was like no other.

Security forces clashed with mourners for Oscar Perez at the main morgue in the Venuzuelan capital, Caracas.

Oscar Perez had been the leading man in an action film, a pilot who fought crime from parachutes with a dog strapped to his back.

In June, he commandeered a helicopter during protests, fired on the Venezuelan supreme court and unfurled a banner urging Venezuelans to rebel.

Perez was an actor, a detective and an insurgent.

To the government he was a terrorist.

To his followers he was a freedom fighter, a modern folk hero like Che Guevara.

Perez's end came on January 15. His body sat in a freezer at the Caracas morgue, with two bullet wounds and a cracked mandible, under armed guard.

On January 21, the government released the corpse, which was buried naked, except for a white sheet wrapped around it.

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

I was driving through the landmark Nagapattinam bridge and I kept looking around as the dark clouds descending on to the ocean and the bright blue boats made a spectacular picture. Just when the bridge ended, I made the driver stop the car at the harbour where boats, the size of mini-ships, stood docked.

Since the 2004 tsunami wrecked havoc in the lives of people, their livelihoods have not been the same. Every time a group sets out in a boat to the sea, all their loved ones sit in fear, praying for their safe return.

Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu was worst hit with a death toll of 6,400 persons and displacing tens of thousands.

Most of them lost their boats and were too scared to buy another as they realised that a wooden boat will succumb to the rough sea anyway.

That is when the local government stepped in and transformed the lives of some of the fisherfolk.

Steeling Through the Waves

Today, most of the wooden boats have been replaced by steel boats. These boats cost anywhere between Rs 25 lakh to Rs 1 crore. Fishermen usually divide the amount between 15 others so that it is affordable.

With the help of the government subsidy of Rs 5 lakh and banks giving loans for about Rs 15 lakh, buying or building a boat has become a reality for many.

The idea was replicated from Kerala, and the then collector J Radhakrishnan set up manufacturing units at Keechankuppam, Akkaraipettai and Nagore in Nagapattinam.

Steel Vs Wood

However, due to the high initial investment, many fisherfolk still take the risk and venture out to the sea in their wooden boats.

But experts say the steel boats are a better and safer bet.

The maintenance costs about Rs 20,000 a year against Rs 1-1.5 lakh needed for the conventional boats. The fuel consumption is much higher for wooden boats.

More Jobs!

'I love taking my conventional boat but after the tsunami, my boat was broken, and all my friends who I usually go to the sea with, passed away. So I am too scared to use that boat anymore,' said Raju, who works on the welding of the boat and is also a joint owner of it.

The concept has opened a whole new job market.

Karthikeyan, who was a carpenter working on wooden boats before the tsunami, today does welding work and heads a team of labourers who work on the boat.

This is a very good initiative, but our lives are all dependant on fisherfolk. Even today, 13 years later, we have still not recovered. Yes, we are getting enough money for food and clothes, but there has been no growth. Steel boats or wooden boats - I don't see any difference in our lives. We are still struggling.Karthikeyan

Though the memories can never fade away and will always linger on, these steel boats provide a sense of confidence and reassurance to the fishermen that even if a disaster strikes, their livelihoods will be safeguarded.

The past decade has witnessed an exponential rise in the adoption of smartphones, internet connectivity and e-commerce. This has subsequently opened up the entire country to smaller retailers and manufacturers.

In this backdrop, with the rise of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) adopting e-commerce, the next pillar of sustained growth will be to tap into global markets. Invest India, the National Investment Promotion and Facilitation Agency of the government of India (under the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion), partnered with Yes Bank Transformation Series, will present this challenge to the brightest minds across B-schools and tech institutes for crowd sourcing perspectives and solutions on how MSMEs can build momentum on growth and capture opportunities presented by global markets.

Yes Bank Transformation Series, which has emerged as an idea crowd sourcing platform has partnered with national institutions over the last three years, seeking to find answers to nationwide challenges. In 2016, the platform had partnered with the ministry of new and renewable energy, government of India, with students tackling the challenge of increasing the usage of roof top solar and making it viable. Last year, in partnership with Atal Innovation Mission, NITI Aayog, the platform sought ideas on the Indian government's ambitious goal of doubling farmer income by 2022 through technology interventions.

The Grand Finale of the 7th edition of Yes Bank Transformation Series witnessed 41 students comprising 15 teams from top educational institutes address themes on how to increase B2C exports from India, initiatives to promote India as a leader in MSME exports, and how Indian MSMEs can further leverage global opportunities. The solutions were presented to an eminent advisory council comprising subject matter experts and senior representatives from Invest India.

The sizeable impact of e-commerce on India's MSME sector supplemented by policy, market and technology interventions are the need of the hour to ensure prosperity for associated industries and the Indian economy as a whole. The forthcoming national e-commerce policy aimed at levelling the playing field for foreign and domestic players, offers significant opportunities for the MSME sector.

Rana Kapoor, managing director and chief executive officer, Yes Bank, said: ""Over the last five years, this platform which we created as a case study challenge has now become an innovator's club -- visualizing and actualizing innovations not only for us and our partner organizations but also for national challenges set by government agencies. Some of the ideas presented today, if implemented, have the potential to be game changers in the MSME space, and this is a matter of great pride for us. For us and for tomorrow's leaders who are an integral part of the Transformation Series, the challenge next year would be to co-create solutions using emerging technologies like AI/ML, blockchain, big data, which can directly be implemented across sectors.""

At the finale, Deepak Bagla, managing director and CEO of Invest India, said: ""MSMEs are the pillar of India's economic growth, contributing over 28% to India's GDP (gross domestic product). Today, MSMEs are embracing e-commerce as an opportunity to increase their geographical reach and access at minimal costs. Proactive support from the government and increased awareness will help create an online presence with access to a global audience. I believe the Yes Bank Transformation Series is a great initiative to catalyse growth of this sector by leveraging the brightest minds towards ensuring that MSMEs can benefit from the undeniable advantages of online platforms.""

The significance of the journey of over 100 days filtered into the morning session of the Grand Finale 2018 on 28 November. The top 15 teams arrived and presented exhaustive solutions to the advisory council. After an intensive round of debate, discussions and deliberation, it was decided that three teams had finally conquered.

'B Squad' from IIM-Bangalore edged out 'A Team Has No Name' (Indian Institute of Foreign Trade) and 'Cryptonite' (SJSOM, IIT Bombay) to win the Yes Bank Transformation Series 2018 award. ""At the finale, I was amazed by the ideas and the depth of the solutions presented by all participating teams. The judging panel was very diverse with industry experts from multiple domains. The questions asked by the panellists were very thought-provoking and also helped us in realizing the possible areas of improvement and further research, which we hadn't even thought of. And lastly, it was an amazing feeling when I realized that we had won,"" said Farhan Ansari, a member of the winning team from IIM-Bangalore.

The winners were awarded ₹5 lakh, the runner-up received ₹3 lakh, and the second runner-up won ₹2 lakh.

Samanvay, an ecosystem to bring together disconnected bodies, processes and policies. The platform will be fortified with a comprehensive micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) e-export policy to ensure coordination between government bodies, private companies and MSMEs in driving business-to-consumer, or B2C, e-commerce export growth.

Project Disha will be the on-boarding and pull initiative under Samanvay at the district level, aimed at assisting micro, small and medium enterprises to develop internet/e-commerce literacy.

This would enable on-boarding of MSMEs (generating awareness of required approvals/licences), sustainability (via single-point nodal body for all issues), and support through creating awareness on best practices, quality standards and technology.

Project Vihaan, regulated by the MSME Export Council, will provide targeted marketing assistance based on country of export and category of export, make cluster-specific marketing policies and provide brand building assistance.

First Runner-Up: A Team Has No Name, IIFT

For promotion of cross border e-commerce, the team recommended a four-pronged strategy to be implemented by the government-consolidation of rules and regulations through a single government policy for e-commerce, aggregator-led MSME cluster development model, amendments to foreign trade policy and simplification of customs, set-up e-commerce pilot zones to offer integrated services such as customs clearance, registration of goods, and bonded warehousing.

The team also proposed an e-commerce initiative called UnboxIndia, a campaign for an assorted gift box of authentic local Indian products to customers abroad, packaged as an experience.

Second Runner-Up: Cryptonite, Shailesh J. Mehta School of Management, IIT-Bombay

The team proposed a single national digital platform for MSMEs to obtain information and submit documents, and to provide them with the facility of bonded warehouses to allow storage, distribution and logistics operations of goods awaiting clearance from customs duties in the destination country.

Another salient solution presented includes leveraging and scaling the infrastructure of Indian postal system to provide a coordinated, interoperable monitoring platform for tracking shipments."

By Abha Goradia

To provide international standard education to students in Marathi, their native language, a first-of-its-kind Maharashtra International Education Board came into being on Tuesday. Launched to commemorate the birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, all schools affiliated to the board will be known as Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International School.

As the first step, 13 schools from 13 districts were given affiliation from the board. The affiliated schools are from Buldhana, Washim, Osmanabad, Parbhani, Thane, Sindhudurg, Chandrapur, Gondia, Nandurbar, Nashik, Kolhapur, Pune and Satara. By next year, the board plans to increase the number of schools to 100.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the initiative is an extension of Vajpayee's Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and will focus on inclusive education. ""It is not an imported board but a board that can be exported,"" he said.

The international syllabus will include knowledge of surrounding areas and the world outside. Education in these schools will be provided in Marathi medium, though there will be an emphasis on improving English language.

Maintaining that the department is working towards ""operation digital board"", Javadekar said that in 15 lakh institutions, students would be taught in digital mode from Class IX to third-year in college in the next three years. The department also plans to introduce exams in Class V and VIII to promote continuous evaluation, he said.

Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said: ""With the formation of the board, we are entering into a new era. It is a true tribute to Vajpayee. The schools' names will remain the same but the education pattern shall be named after Vajpayee.""

Maharashtra has two crore students from classes I to XII, said School Education Minister Vinod Tawde. ""We need to nurture students to not just prepare for international courses but to also sustain and be successful,"" he added.

""Through the new system, students will learn not just for marks but also develop qualities and life-skills... We have evolved from a Gurukul system, and the new board has included aspects of Sanskrit in its course,"" said state Minister for Rural Development Pankaja Munde.

According to a government resolution dated October 14, 2016, 100 schools run by tribal development, social justice and school education departments would be affiliated to the new board. The criteria for providing affiliation included joint initiative by all stakeholders; number of students; infrastructure facilities, including a well-constructed building; facility to increase intake capacity; separate washrooms for girls and boys; Internet facilities; clean surroundings as well as facilities to use academic technology and ferrying students, among others.

Children of Kashmir's Leper Colony at Baharar, Lal Bazar are worried about their future as the authorities have asked them to vacate the accommodation as soon as the patient enrolled dies.

According to inhabitants, they were asked by the authorities to vacate the family quarters immediately after the enrolled patient expires. They said their parents have struggled throughout their lives due to leprosy but now they (patients) are concerned about future of their children.

Situated on the banks of Nigeen Lake and spread over 312 Kanals of land, the colony was established during the 19th century under Kashmir Medical Mission by the British to isolate leprosy patients from the rest of the population.

Nazir Ahmad Khan, 48 told Rising Kashmir that six years ago his parents died who were leprosy patients. He said when a survey was conducted for new homes the authorities denied accommodation to Khan's family and forced him to live in a dilapidated building.

""My fault is that I am born here, where I will go for my rights. Despite moving from pillar to post nothing has been done so far. Where will we go after our parents expire? Khan questioned.

New housing facilities were inaugurated in 2014 by the Srinagar Municipal Corporation (SMC). Originally, 105 quarters were proposed but only 66 were given approval for the patients. Five of them died, leaving the total number of quarters 61.

He said the vision of government has always been for the short-term. They allowed patients to marry and have families. Who cares as our (families) are suffering and struggling each day, he said.

Most of the families are living in an atmosphere of uncertainty regarding the ownership of residential quarters. If the patient expires, many families will be rendered homeless.

""Children of some leprosy patients are government employees but majority are laborers and daily wagers. Will we educate our children to get rid of this stigma or buy houses for them,"" said another resident Javed Ahmad.

""We cannot claim property from our ancestors as they disown our parents due to Leprosy stigma,"" Ahmad said adding that the government should reconsider its decision before doing anything adverse.

Another resident at the colony wishing anonymity said their colony has been recommended for relocation in 'Srinagar Master Plan' proposal as the area will be handed over to the Tourism Department.

""It would be shifted in near future and our children shall be forced to face problems,"" he said.

""There are 16 families who were barred government accommodation and were forced to live in dilapidated buildings, which can prove disastrous during natural calamities,"" he said.

Around 69 leprosy patients are currently residing in the colony, out of which 20 have not married. Most of their children as well as their requirements are growing. Children are provided ration only till the age of 18. A few years ago, they even had a school as part of the hospital which is no longer functional.

The patients also accused SMC of neglecting the colony and not maintaining the cleanliness inside the premises. They said the whole colony has been turned into a garbage dumping site.

Commissioner SMC, Peer Hafizullah Shah told Rising Kashmir that he will look into the matter. ""Currently I have no knowledge about these settlements. I will also look into the sanitation issue in the colony and issue appropriate directions to the concerned Ward Officer,"" Shah said."

Food stalls offering cuisines from across the country filled roads along Free School Street, Park Street Post Office and Allen Park, while the city's iconic eateries were also packed to capacity, with long queues outside.

Many restaurants in the city added traditional delicacies like roasted turkey and Christmas pudding to their menu for the festive period.

Celebrations were also on in full swing at the brightly-lit Bow Barracks -- the hub of Anglo-Indians in central Kolkata -- soaking in the Yuletide spirit with home-brewed wine and the customary plum cake.

He loved decorating trees, singing songs like ""Silent Night"" and watching the annual Christmas pageant recounting the birth of Jesus.

But in early December, the police shut down Gu's usual place of worship, the Early Rain Covenant Church in the southwest city of Chengdu as part of what activists said is the most severe crackdown on Christianity in more than a decade. The police confiscated bibles, shuttered a school and seminary run by the well-known church and detained Early Rain's outspoken pastor on charges of ""inciting subversion,"" punishable in serious cases with at least five years in prison.

On Christmas Eve, Gu, 31, a rice seller, went to the only safe place to worship that he knew: a friend's home, where he recited hymns and prayed for the two dozen Early Rain members that are in detention. Fearing that he and his friends might be arrested, Gu used encrypted chat apps to share information about surveillance and harassment by the police.

""We will not forfeit our faith because of suppression by the authorities,"" Gu said.

As millions around the world gather to celebrate Christmas, China is capping a year in which the government of President Xi Jinping has led an unrelenting campaign against unofficial churches in China, which by some estimates serve as many as 30 million people.

Xi, apparently concerned that independent worship might pose a threat to the ruling Communist Party's dominance over daily life in China, has sought to bring Christianity more firmly under the party's control. The government this year banned online sales of the Bible, burned crosses, demolished churches and forced at least a half-dozen places of worship to close.

The campaign comes as Xi, the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong, has worked to more aggressively control religion across China, including the detention of thousands of Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang.

Renee Xia, international director for China Human Rights Defenders, an advocacy group, described the effort as targeting the ""heart of the underground Christian resistance."" The government has focused its campaign on unofficial Christian churches that promote ideas like social justice or have been critical of the party's grip on society.

""The message,"" Xia said, ""is that Xi can't be messed with.""

The crackdown has escalated in the weeks leading up to Christmas. The police this month shut down the 40-year-old Rongguili Church in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, which attracted thousands of worshippers. And in September, the authorities in Beijing ordered the closure of the 1,500-member Zion Church, one of the largest unofficial churches in the capital.

The government requires religious groups to register, though many still worship in unofficial churches, sometimes called underground or house churches.

Many in the party believe Christianity, which by some estimates is China's fastest-growing religion, promotes Western values and ideals like human rights that conflict with the aims of China's authoritarian government and Xi's embrace of traditional Chinese culture and Confucian teachings that emphasize obedience and order.

But the government's heavy-handed efforts to obliterate several high-profile churches have been met with resistance among Christians.

On Christmas Eve, the authorities posted a sign at Early Rain's former headquarters saying its 23rd-floor sanctuary had been converted into office space for the local government.

Li Shuangde, a teacher in Chengdu who has been part of Early Rain since 2011, said that church members had been asked by the authorities to sign letters stating that they no longer believe in Christianity. He said Early Rain had no choice but continue to exist in secret. ""We have moved underground,"" he said.

Members have continued to hold Sunday services, sometimes on the banks of a river near the church's former headquarters in a downtown high-rise. They have called for the release of detained leaders, including Wang Yi, the pastor of Early Rain, and his wife, Jiang Rong.

Wang, in a pre-written message released after his detention, spoke about the importance of disobedience.

""The Communist regime's persecution of the church is an extremely vicious crime,"" he wrote. ""As a pastor of the Christian church, I must strictly and publicly condemn such crimes.""

Wang had been scheduled to deliver a Christmas Eve sermon at Early Rain titled, ""The God Who Bestows Peace."" Instead, hundreds of Early Rain members on Monday scattered across Chengdu for services inside the homes of friends and relatives or at welcoming churches.

At Chengdu Xishuipang Reformed Church, a Protestant church with close ties to Early Rain, more than 100 people gathered inside a worship hall on the 16th floor of an apartment building.

A children's choir sang ""Silent Night,"" and a small Christmas tree, decorated with snowflakes, was on display near the lectern.

The anxieties brought on by the recent arrests hung over the ceremony.

""If you see the police, national security or community workers greet them with gentleness,"" Wen Hongbin, an elder at Xishuipang, told the congregation. ""If they try to grab the microphone, I ask the brothers sitting in the front row to please stop them.""

While he did not explicitly mention Early Rain, Wen asked those in attendance to remember ""those who are criminally detained."" Then he began a sermon about the meaning of Christmas and the sacrifice made by Jesus.

Since Xi rose to power in 2012, the authorities have led a sustained campaign against unregistered churches. In one province, more than 1,500 crosses were removed from churches between 2014 to 2016, according to advocacy groups.

This year, some Chinese cities have banned Christmas displays. But the government also allows some degree of celebration, in part to stimulate the economy. Here in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, Christmas trees stand side by side on city streets with propaganda posters, and music from ""The Nutcracker"" plays in the background at malls.

Officials in the United States have denounced the Chinese government's efforts to limit the spread of Christianity.

""China's Christians and other faith communities are under siege and treated as enemies of the state for daring to worship and peacefully live out their faith,"" Sen Marco Rubio of Florida and Rep Chris Smith of New Jersey said in a joint statement condemning the recent detentions.

But China's growing influence in world affairs has shielded it from some criticism.

One notably silent voice: the Vatican, which in September reached a provisional deal with the Chinese government to end a decades-old power struggle over the right to appoint bishops in China. The Vatican said it sent a delegation of leaders to China this month to work out details of the agreement, but declined to comment on the crackdown on Christian churches.

Despite Xi's efforts to expand the officially atheist party's control of worship, religious life in China is flourishing. While official figures are imprecise, experts believe there are about 60 million Christians in China, with roughly half worshipping at state-sanctioned churches and half at unofficial churches.

Independent churches like Early Rain, with more than 500 members, have attracted large followings in recent years, especially among white-collar workers seeking an escape from rampant materialism at the center of modern Chinese life.

While sermons at state-sanctioned churches are often tightly scripted, independent churches boom with searing indictments of corrupt officials and rousing calls to protect the rights of the poor.

Early Rain, which Wang founded in 2008, was among the most daring. Wang called Xi a sinner, held prayer sessions each year to mark the brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square in 1989, and organized a fund to support relatives of political prisoners in China.

Gu, the rice seller, began attending services at Early Rain two years ago after finding videos of Wang's fiery sermons online. He felt Wang's concern for the poor was in line with his own view that the government was abusing workers and violating human rights by destroying their homes to make way for expensive developments. Gu was baptized last year.

""I saw injustices in society,"" Gu said. ""I saw that the government's promotion of China as a just country that enforces laws in a civilized manner was all a lie.""

Worried for his own safety, Gu recently closed his business, hoping to avoid government scrutiny. He said he has grown fearful as he has watched the police arrest his friends.

Gu has turned to the Bible in recent days for support. Sometimes, he recites a verse from the Book of Proverbs: ""The path of the righteous is like the morning sun, shining ever brighter till the full light of day."""

Jai Ram Thakur said that the State Government was giving special thrust on development of far flung and remote areas of the State. He said that the Government would provide all possible help to develop Lag valley from tourism point of view.

The Chief Minister said that present State Government was completing one year of office on 27th of this month. He said that one year back when he took oath as the Chief Minister of the State, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and top BJP Central leadership graced the oath ceremony held at Shimla. It was honour for our State that on the completion of one year of office, the Prime Minister was once again gracing the 'Jan Aabhar Rally' being held at Dharmashala on 27th of this month, he said.

He said that seven helicopters were provided by the Centre to airlift the people stranded due to untimely snowfall in Lahaul valley and Holi in Chamba.

The Chief Minister also accused the previous State Government for making announcements in fag end of its tenure with a desperate attempt to grab power. He said that several colleges and educational institutions were announced without any provision in the budget. He said that on the other hand the State Government from the day one was working for the development of the State without any politics of vengeance and vendetta. He said that the very first decision of the State Government was aimed at welfare of the senior citizens.

Jai Ram Thakur said that Jan Manch has been a big success among the common man of the State as this has ensured redressal of their grievances nearer to their homes.

The Bhawan would have car parking in ground floor and shopping complex in first floor. The second floor would have five suits and third floor would have Conference halls.

Forest and Transport Minister Shri Govind Thakur said that the State was fortunate to have Chief Minister from the Mandi Parliamentary Constituency for the first time after the formation of the State. He said that the State was witnessing all-round and equitable development under dynamic leadership of Jai Ram Thakur. He expressed gratitude that Kullu district was witnessing rapid pace of development for the last one year.

Ram Swaroop Sharma said that during the four and a half years he had strived hard at the Centre to raise developmental issues of the State.

President Trump, who has cancelled his trip to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Monday, said he was ""all alone"" in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come to the negotiating table to end the partial government shutdown.

Through a series of tweets and pictures, Trump showed he was working hard while the opposition Democratic lawmakers were in their homes celebrating Christmas.

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" Trump tweeted on Monday.

Trump wants the Democrats to fund for a border wall to stop illegal immigrants from entering the US. Democrats have refused his demands for USD 5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that resulted in a partial government at midnight on Friday.

""At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about. Crazy!"" Trump said.

Several hours later, Trump said in a tweet that he was in the Oval Office and working on border security.

""I am in the Oval Office and just gave out a 115-mile-long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of dollars, and lives, will be saved!"" he said.

He also tweeted a picture of him with senior administration officials for a briefing on North Korea.

""Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea - Progress being made. Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim!"" Trump said.

Later in the evening, he and the First lady Melania helped children across the country to track Santa.

""Nothing new on the shutdown. We need more security,"" he told reporters during this phone call with children.

Santa Tracker is a 63-year tradition of tracking Santa's sleigh from the North Pole to children all over the world.

Despite the shutdown, military personnel were on the operation, as were reportedly some 1,500 people who volunteer each year.

Trump told a kid named Coleman, ""Hello, is this Coleman? Merry Christmas. How are you? How old are you?.... Are you doing well in school? Are you still a believer in Santa Claus?""

""How are you? Are you tracking Santa? ...I want to wish you a Merry Christmas. Thank you. Nice talking to you,"" Melania told an unidentified child.

""What's Santa going to get you for Christmas? Who's with you....Have a great Christmas., and I'll talk to you again, OK?"" Trump told another kid, possibly from Indiana.

""Are you tracking Santa? Do you know where he is?... I hope your dreams come true,"" said Melania to another child.

Trump also could be heard asking kids where they were from and then thanking a general, possibly from NORAD or the North American Aerospace Command.

""We were always asking: Are we the natural owners of this business? And our view is that we have almost ceased to be natural owners of the business,"" Singh said in an interview. ""If the business doesn't grow, by definition, it dies, so how do we encourage the legacy and the sustainability of Max Healthcare.""

Singh had earlier wanted to give up control of the insurance business when he started talks with HDFC Life. The move failed. However, now he is bullish on insurance and is aiming to grow the business through mergers and acquisitions. Other areas of interest include real estate, angel investment, and senior living and hospitality. Singh said he will decide on new business ideas after the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.

Edited excerpts:

When we met two years ago, you were very bullish on the healthcare business. What has changed?

Frankly, its a time-in-life question...between two years ago and now, the business arena has moved very substantially. Every sector and every business is more competitive and in every sector margins are under stress...in every sector, talent availability is also becoming a challenge, retention is becoming a challenge...basically, any successful business is seen with a new level of challenge and toxicity of its own kind. So, basically we started to think about how we must balance our portfolio. You cannot do everything with the same level of commitment and same level of growth. In that sense, the business, which is the most demanding in terms of capital, in terms of time, to maintain adequate margin is healthcare...It is still not an organized sector...therefore, scale is very important. Scale means capital investment. So, we have to take a call...And, if we deploy the level of capital required to get the scale in the healthcare sector, we are talking about a minimum of 1,000-2,000 beds. So, if you take the rule of thumb number of even ₹1 crore per bed, which is always not the case, in cases of neuro, cardiac and oncology it can go up to ₹3 crores a bed...1,000 beds means ₹2,000-3,000 crore. We do not have that sort of capital available with us. Besides, if I take a look at the succession plan in terms of the management team available, I don't have now 10 years available of life to be able to focus on building Max healthcare to take it to the next level. We are very practical about these things, we are very aware about these things.

So, what happens to your legacy? You wanted to exit the insurance business but that didn't happen. You spoke about real estate, education, manufacturing, etc. We have not seen much action there either.

One year ago we decided not to (venture into) the education business. We were very keen....in 1999-2000...there were four sectors that we had identified--healthcare, insurance, education and hospitality. About six months ago, we decided not to go ahead with education, even after spending two years and having started a team who were going to help us. The truth of the matter is that regulatory forces in the country didn't help us get off the ground in the education space, because if you buy real estate at commercial prices, you can provide education, but you cannot have education business. If you get into any society structure or any existing education institution, you try shutting a school with 500 people you go to jail. Therefore, we dumped education. Manufacturing, I never said. I always said we will be all services sector company and we will hold one manufacturing business for cash...that's what we said and that's what we are doing...we are not going to grow the packaging film business.

What are your priority areas going forward?

Life insurance, real estate, investing, senior living and hospitality.

Hospitality is in your personal capacity, right?

To begin with, even telecom I started as a personal venture....that is simply a question of a capital structure...we started hospitality as a personal business because at that time the demerger of Max India had not happened. And, as a listed company, which had interests in healthcare and insurance, if I had announced that we are getting into hospitality, the stock price would have tanked by 50%. Now that we are building some scale in hospitality...who knows it can continue to be private or may become...a little bit of both. That's just a matter of capital, convenience and timing. And, as you know, our whole history has been to live a life of a listed company--be it in governance, compliance, disclosures, whatever it maybe. So, I am not afraid of listed companies...we like listed businesses. We will run our private businesses exactly the same as we run our listed companies.

What's your overview of the insurance business? You wanted to exit because you thought that the space was too cluttered.

Since the HDFC merger failure we have grown 25%. We are the largest non-bank private life insurance company. So, if you ask me I don't know why the other 18 exist...I can tell you....why we exist... Agency business is growing at 33 -40% month on month. We have just engaged into a renewal refresh exercise with New York Life... They have given us branding support and New York Life just recently acquired 2% of Max financial services. Life insurance is only going one way, which is up.

You have made a name for yourself by creating value, your shareholders have always benefitted...

Right now what I have stated... Let the election come and go... Let some more hiccups happen then we will tell you what are the new things. Life insurance, real estate, investing, senior living and hospitality. There is a huge opportunity in real estate and the key differentiator in real estate is going to be 2-3 things....execution., efficiency, openness, transparency and honesty. Openness, transparency and honesty has not been a feature of a real estate industry. In the investment business, I can be quiet successful because I understand the country, I understand the market and I know people like them. Senior living is exactly like health insurance when we started health insurance for the first 5 years health insurance was a dead duck now why it is climbing up because people have begun to realize that they need health insurance. Senior living will be the same.

What sort of legacy you want to leave behind?

I want to leave a positive legacy and I quote it saying I don't want to leave a legacy of Ranbaxy, Fortis and Vijay Mallya."

Sen (a full-time member of the Communist Party of India [Marxist]) allegedly led a mob of frenzied party activists who attacked the Sain family (prominent supporters of the Congress) in Bardhaman town on the morning of 17 March 1970 in what has come to be known as one of the most horrific political murders in the country.

It was the brutality of the incident that shocked people across the country. The Sain family had gathered at their ancestral house for the naming ceremony of a baby born to the family. The CPI(M) activists, led by Khokon Sen (who allegedly changed his name later to Nirupam Sen), had taken out a procession to celebrate the fall of the second United Front government a day earlier. The Sain family, steadfast Congress supporters, had refused the blandishments and threats by the CPI(M) to join the red party. And they, thus, became the target of the Marxists' ire.

Rekha Rani Sain, the widow of Naba Kumar Sain, the eldest son of the family, still recounts the horror of that morning in 1970 (read here). A few hundred CPI(M) activists started shooting arrows and pelting stones at Sainbari (the name of the family home), after which a few dozen of them entered the house and went on a looting spree. First, they gouged out the eyes of Naba Kumar and then hacked his two brothers - Pranab Kumar and Malay Kumar - to death in front of their mother, the widowed Mrignayana Devi. When she tried to save her sons, they hit her as well. Jiten Ray, a private tutor who had gone to Sainbari to tutor Rakha Rani's daughter, was also killed brutally.

The Sain family was in a festive mood that day, a child born to a daughter of the family, Swarnalata Jash, was to be named. The child was a month old. The CPI(M) murderers did not spare the infant and threw him into a fire that was lit for the havan ceremony, but family members rescued the baby, who was later named Amrit Kumar and is now 48 years old. He still has burn marks on his body.

It was, however, what the Marxist murderers did after that which horrified everyone. They reportedly mixed the blood of Pranab and Malay, who they had killed, with rice that had been cooked for offering to the family deity, and forced Mrignayana Devi to eat that rice! They also smeared the blood of her sons on Mrignayana's forehead!

The old lady never recovered from the shock and died a mental wreck in 1978. Then, Indira Gandhi, the prime minister at the time, visited the bereaved family and led the nation in condemning the horrific act.

Their bloodlust not fulfilled, CPI(M) activists murdered Naba Kumar (whose eyes they had gouged out in March 1970) a year later. A National Students' Union of India (NSUI) activist Gunamoni Roy, who was a witness to the massacre, was murdered when he had gone to depose before the Tarapada Roy Commission that was instituted to probe the massacre by then chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray in 1971.

Many other witnesses were threatened and silenced into submission while others were reportedly bought off with offers of jobs and 'blood money'. Around 83 CPI(M) activists were named in the first information report (FIR) filed with the police and the names of Sen and Benoy Konar (another CPI(M) leader who became a Politburo member) figure in the eleventh and sixty-third in the list of accused named in the FIR. Later, after the CPI(M) came to power in 1977, files pertaining to the case went missing.

The police filed a charge sheet (number 22, filed on 8 February 1971) that named 56 persons including Benoy Konar (accused number 11 in the charge sheet). The same charge sheet also names 56 'absconders', in which the name of Bhujanga Sen's son Khokon Sen figures at number 23. The names of Rajat Bandopadhyay, Amal Haldar, Pabitra Bhattacharya, Kalyan Kanta Mondal, Sudin Chattopadhyay, Mridul Sen, Suhas Chattopadhyay, Binoy Konar's brother Sushanta Konar, Sishir Chakraborty, Amiya Saha, and Brajaraj Mukhopadhya also features among the chargesheeted absconders. All of them are CPI(M) leaders. Khokon Sen is Nirupam Sen.

It was only after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011 that some files pertaining to the case were dug up from old records at Writers Building (the Raj-era structure that used to house all major government departments till a few years ago) in 2012 (read here). The All India Legal Aid Forum is pursuing the case and its general secretary, Joydeep Mukherjee (a Supreme Court lawyer), who had filed a petition before the Supreme Court, holds that Sen was never exonerated or even granted bail in the case.

Mukherjee is also critical of a commission (under Abhinava Basu, a retired judge of the Calcutta High Court) set up after the Trinamool Congress came to power in 2011. The commission, Mukherjee says, has not examined all witnesses. ""I hear the Commission has submitted its report. If that is true, the state government should reveal the findings. A lot of time has passed and many witnesses have died. One of the prime accused, Khokon Sen, just died. The Sain family is awaiting justice,"" Mukherjee told Swarajya (read here).

Sen was born in October 1946 into a family of communist supporters. His father, a school teacher, was part of the communist movement from the British days and had joined the communist chorus of ""yeh azadi jhoota hai (this freedom is a lie)"".

Indoctrinated at a young age, Khokon (later Nirupam) joined the Students' Federation of India (SFI), the students' wing of the CPI(M), when he was in school and became the organisation's Bardhaman district secretary in 1966 at the age of 20. He became a full-time member of the CP(M) in 1968, the party's Bardhaman district secretary in 1989 (he held the post till 1995), and was elected from Bardhaman South Assembly constituency in 1987, 2001, and 2006. He became a member of the CPI(M) Central Committee in 1998 and the party politburo in 2008.

Sen led the industrialisation drive when he joined the first government of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as Industries and Commerce Minister in 2001. The CPI(M)'s promise of industrialising the state and creating jobs led to its resounding victory in the 2006 elections. But the ground started slipping from beneath the Marxists' feet later that year with protests gaining ground over Singur (where land was forcibly acquired for the Tatas' Nano car project) and Nandigram (where land was sought to be acquired for a chemical hub). The rest, as they say, is history.

On Wednesday (26 December), when comrades stream past his body at the CPI(M) party headquarters in Kolkata to pay their last respects, many would be wondering if it was this man who brought about the downfall of the party with his industrialisation mantra. And the surviving members of the Sain family are also unhappy that the man who brought them such misery was never brought to justice.

Sen, in death as in life, remains a controversial figure."

They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

We weren't even a single mass of land. Mumbai, or Bombay -- I'm not getting political here, but the city has had over 20 names since its inception -- started off as an archipelago of seven islands, which were just part of one ruling empire or another. Not till the seven islands were gifted as a dowry to the King of England in 1661, and eventually handed over to the British East India company in 1667 for a princely sum total of 10 Pounds per annum, did the development of Mumbai as the trading hub we know it as today, began.

While the Portuguese arrived in Mumbai much before the British, ruling the seven islands from the northern bastion on Bassein (current day Vasai), part of their key responsibilities was missionary work. Till the 1660s, the islands of Bombay were dotted with Catholic Churches, with St Michael's Church in Mahim dating back to 1534, St Andrews in Bandra established in 1575, followed by other churches in Dadar (Church of Our Lady of Salvation aka Portuguese Church), Byculla (Gloria Church) and so on.

Well, the English settlers weren't Catholics and in effect, only had makeshift chapels to worship in.

The first place of public worship for the followers of the Anglican Church came up on Christmas day, 300 years ago, in the form of St Thomas' Church.

But first, some history

Back when Mumbai was still an archipelago, the first thing that was done on the main H-shaped island of Bombay, was fortification. Be mindful that the East India Company was a trading company and India was not under the British Crown yet. So like any trading organisation at the time, they had to protect their land. The reason that the area around the current day CST station is called Fort is that there actually stood a fort surrounded by a moat -- protecting the island of Bombay and its natural deep-water harbour (the reason the East India Company was interested in Bombay in the first place) from marauders and pirates.

To enter this fortified city, there were three gates which led the way in. The gate at the northern-most end was called the Bazaar Gate -- that's where the Crawford Market exists now. The southern-most gate which was called the Apollo Gate is where current day Gateway of India stands currently. The gate in between was called the Church Gate -- the location of Flora Fountain. And no, that naming convention had nothing to do with the railway station of the same name nearby. In fact, it was the other way round.

Why it was called the Church Gate, you ask? Well, imagine you are standing outside this Church Gate before the 1860s, what you would then see in front of you was an archway, and through this archway you could see the spire of the St Thomas' Church.

Erstwhile Church Gate with St Thomas in the background. Archival image

St Thomas' Church is what gave the name to the gate, and eventually to the station beside it.

St Thomas' Church was the first Anglican Church in Mumbai, named after St Thomas, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus Christ and among the only ones to have had come to India. The foundation stone was laid in 1674 after the then Governor of Bombay Presidency, Gerald Aungier wrote to the Court of Directors for assistance ""to erect a small church for public worship in the centre of town"" according to Dr V Gupchup's St Thomas Cathedral Bombay: A Witness to History. But from 1675 to 1715, barely any work took place. The funds collected for the construction of the cathedral mysteriously disappeared. What we had, instead of a fully constructed church, was five metre high walls.

After 40 year slumber, church work begins

From 21 September 1714 to 19 June 1715, the then East India Company Chaplain, Richard Cobbe, carried out the service inside two rooms in a building in Fort. Cobbe wasn't too pleased with the unsuitable nature of these services which were carried out in such a private manner. In 1715, Cobbe took over the second part of the construction of this church with a resolve to finish it.

""I ventured to propose the building of a Church for God's honour and service, according to the rule of the Church of England, that all island might feel we had some religion among us,"" writes Cobbe in his book, Bombay Church: Or, a True Account of the Building and Finishing the English Church at Bombay in the East Indies.

19 June 1715, being the first Sunday after Trinity, is when Cobbe recommended a Sermon to preach about building a proper church to have a more public celebration of God. After that, work on the incomplete church began in all earnestness. Cobbe wrote to a whole bunch on probable financiers, requesting them to donate funds for the building of this church. Everyone from the East India Company to businessmen operating out of Surat to Persian businessmen were approached and they donated. The exchange of letters between Cobbe and the benefactors went on from July 1715 to 1720. A sum total of Rs 43,992 was collected in all.

On Christmas Day in 1718, 300 years ago, is when the first service was held in this church.

But it wasn't until July 1837 that the Church was consecrated as a Cathedral, which coincided with the appointment of the first Bishop of Bombay Thomas Carr -- a life-size memorial to whom lies just on the right side of the altar.

A work in progress, reflecting the growing city

The St Thomas' Cathedral as it exists today, was not how it looked in 1718 when it began its public services. In fact, the neo-gothic style of architecture whose interiors are inspired by St Thomas Cathedral in Ireland, got additional elements as the decades passed and funds were easier to come by. Thanks in part to the cotton and opium traders of the time. Many portions of the church were added in the following years. For instance, the tower and clock were added in 1838. The inner chancel was renovated and enlarged in 1860 along with the external buttresses.

It was almost like the church was growing along with the city. From a non-important back of the beyond, to a powerful financial hub during the British era -- the seeds for making Mumbai the financial hub that it is today were planted back in those days.

More than a church

St Thomas' Cathedral is unlike most other churches in Mumbai. The walls of the cathedral are decorated with beautiful poignant sculptures and bas-reliefs of soldiers lost to war, memorials to prominent personalities who have left their stamp in Mumbai's history, such as JA Ballard (after whom the Ballard Estate is named), and much more. The marble plaques remembering fallen soldiers have been financed mostly by their comrades or family members. Unlike the Afghan Church in Colaba, which was built in memoriam of Indian and British soldiers who died in the Anglo-Afghan War, the St Thomas Cathedral has more Anglican memorials.

The altar windows were designed in the 1800s by Victorian stained glass designer and manufacturer, Charles Kempe. There's an interesting bit of anecdote behind that as well. Kempe had hoped to become a priest of the Cathedral, but was prevented by his stammer. However, he said, ""If I was not permitted to minister in the Sanctuary, I would use my talents to adorn it."" And his artwork is there for all to see. The Cathedral is blessed with some impressive stained glass work. Enter the church and look right and you have a stained glass work showcasing St Thomas with the Holy Bible flanked by St Gabriel and St Michael. As you walk down towards the apse, the semi-circular wall also has fine stained glass work, some of which had to be restored over the years.

Back in those days, every church was associated with a school and St Thomas' Cathedral was instrumental in the creation of one of the most popular schools in Mumbai, the Cathedral and John Connon School in 1860.

The Cathedral also saw almost all the baptisms that took place among all the Anglican churches in Bombay back in the 1800s and early 1900s. It kept records of not just baptisms but also marriages and death in all of Bombay Presidency (an area encompassing Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, and parts of Sindh region). A register of these records has an entry of a very prominent person's baptism on 22 January 1866. The son of John Lockwood and Alice Kipling -- Joseph Rudyard Kipling -- was baptised in this very Cathedral. Yes, the author of books such as The Jungle Book and Kim, was a Bombay boy.

It was also considered to be the 'Zero Point' or the centre of the city. The 16 milestones laid across erstwhile Bombay used the Cathedral as the starting point. Come to think of it, the towering spires of the Cathedral back in the day made it the most prominent landmark on the Bombay island.

For probably the first time in the Cathedral's history, some of its artefacts -- around 41 in all -- have been showcased at the ongoing exhibition The Living Cathedral at the Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vaastu Sangrahalay. These artefacts include the Holy Bible that was used to read out from 1870, silver chalices and flagons, a Bishop's staff which has carvings of Jesus as a shepherd, fading black and white portraits of Bishops from years ago and much more. The exhibit is a good journey of the cathedral along with the city in which it existed.

But I'd say, visit the Cathedral instead if you haven't already. Even if you have, visit again, especially now that it has been decorated like a shining star. Walk around its premises, admire the supporting buttresses behind the chancel.

If there was one underrated gem in Mumbai, this is it.

During his address at the university's convocation ceremony, the chancellor also asked the university to keep tabs on things beyond academics on the campus. Tripathi wanted teachers to be role models and students to be disciplined.

Tripathi's remarks came in the backdrop of the ruckus at JU during the admission season this year, for which holding the entrance tests was delayed.

Vice-chancellor Suranjan Das, whose term is supposed to end next year, in his speech expressed regret that despite attaining new heights of excellence, that is often undermined by a section of the media, which tend to highlight the momentary tensions within the university community.

Das proposed the introduction of online registration of grievance from civil society and university's time-bound response. ""I am confident that JU, drawing upon its rich nationalist and democratic legacy, will be able to address critical issues of nation building, fulfilling the faith that Rabindranath Tagore had reposed in the students of the Bengal National College and School, the precursor of the present-day JU,"" Das said.

He added, ""As my term comes to an end soon, it is particularly comforting to me to find that our university, strengthened by its recent national and international recognitions, is poised to build bridges to the future. As I look back, I feel that although I did my best to serve the university, I might not have always been successful, nor did I perhaps satisfy all sections of the university community.""

JU had been embroiled in controversy during the admission season this year with the entrance exams being postponed several times and the process being hampered. Das had met Tripathi to seek his views to break the deadlock. After getting legal opinion, Das had referred the matter to the university's highest decision-making body -- the executive council. Yet there was no progress with a divided house. Finally Das had offered to resign. But the chancellor gave a go-ahead to call another EC where a final decision was taken."

When he was part of the Opposition for several years, Vajpayee was called the ""right man in the wrong party"". However, during his tenure as the prime minister, he began to be called ""vikas purush"". After he retired from active politics, Vajpayee came to be known as ""Bhishma Pitamah"". However, one sobriquet stuck with him throughout his life -- that of a ""poet-politician"".

""Hardliner"" to ""right man in wrong party""

A young Vajpayee flirted with communism before joining the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in 1939. After having dropped out of a law school, Vajpayee joined RSS' mouthpiece ""Panchjanya"" in 1947. However, his career took off after his association with Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee began. His eloquence in Hindi proved valuable to Mookerjee, who wanted to refine his Hindi skills. The young Vajpayee became his ""stenographer, translator, help and secretary, all rolled into one"", noted the 2016 book The Untold Vajpayee.

Mookerjee died in mysterious circumstances in 1953, but Vajpayee quickly emerged out of the tragedy to achieve greater success. After losing a Lok Sabha by-election in 1955, he bounced back in 1957 by winning from the Balrampur constituency. Subsequently, Vajpayee emerged as a prominent Opposition leader.

It is often said that Jawaharlal Nehru deeply influenced Vajpayee's formative parliamentary career. So much so, that Jan Sangh leader Balraj Madhok used to call Vajpayee a ""Nehruite"". Acharya Kripalani, on the other hand, believed Vajpayee was ""Nehru's planted man in the Opposition"".

Nevertheless, when Nehru died in May 1964, Vajpayee paid rich tributes to him. ""In the Ramayana, Maharshi Valmiki has said of Lord Ram that he brought the impossible together. In Panditji's life, we see a glimpse of what the great poet said,"" Vajpayee said, comparing the late prime minister to Lord Ram.

In fact, according to a popular story, while stepping into South Block for the very first time as a minister, he noticed a portrait of Nehru missing from its usual spot. Vajpayee is reported to have said then, ""Where has it gone? I want it back."" The portrait was immediately reinstated.

Perhaps, as observed by noted Canadian scholar Robin Jeffery, the ""undying charm of parliamentary politics"" may have influenced Vajpayee to evolve into a more moderate politician. As Vajpayee began straddling the middle path in the 1970s and 1980s, he succeeded in bringing the Jan Sangh and its successor, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), into the mainstream.

Vajpayee's moderate politics has been credited for the continuity in India's foreign policy. Instead of reviewing India's special relationship with the Soviet Union as the then foreign minister, he chose to continue with the relationship while building bridges with the United States, as mentioned in Kingshuk Nag's book Atal Bihari Vajpayee: A Man for All Seasons.

Vajpayee helped the BJP form electoral alliances ahead of the 1998 and 1999 polls. It was during this time that the moniker ""right man in the wrong party"" became strongly associated with him. Vajpayee himself was amused by this moniker. Some time in the late 1990s, while speaking in Parliament, Vajpayee quipped, ""Toh is achhe Vajpayee se apka kya karne ka irada hai? (so what is it that you intend to do with this good Vajpayee?)""

'Vikas Purush' to 'Bhishma Pitamah'

Contemporary India would remember Vajpayee for several grand infrastructure projects and the first national telecom policy. In fact, the Golden Quadrilateral -- linking Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata -- and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojna were Vajpayee's pet projects. Many analysts have claimed that Vajpayee has been the only true economic reformer, so far.

Perhaps, Vajpayee's commitment to reforms could be gauged by his Independence Day speech in 2000: ""Let us together resolve to make this decade, the Decade of Development... Reforms are the need of the hour. For example, the world has changed much in the past 50 years, and so has India. There have been many far-reaching political and economic transformations across the globe... To reform is to turn the inevitability of change in the direction of progress.""

What he proclaimed from the ramparts of the Red Fort did happen. The first decade of 2000 has consistently been called the golden period of the Indian economy. Thus, it came as no surprise that Vajpayee was called ""Vikas Purush"" by then BJP chief (now India's vice-president) Venkaiah Naidu. That Naidu's proclamation led to a political storm in 2003 is another story altogether.

However, a multitude of factors -- ranging from rural neglect to the ghastly 2002 post-Godhra riots -- brought about the NDA government's downfall in the 2004 General Elections, effectively ending Vajpayee's political career. Vajpayee subsequently became the elder statesman. During a crucial debate on the Indo-US nuclear deal, Manmohan Singh had sought Vajpayee's help to form a consensus among various parties. Singh reportedly said, ""I now urge the Bhishma Pitamah (grand old man) of Indian politics to also listen to the call of his conscience and let the national interest prevail over narrow and partisan approach in politics.""

Vajpayee straddled the highs and lows of democracy and strengthened the political milieu of India.

Had he not become a politician, he would certainly have been a poet. ""Those who have heard Atal reciting poetry say that the BJP chief was a great orator while delivering political speeches, but his recitation of poetry was even better,"" noted Nag in his book.

But for Vajpayee, politics took precedence over poetry on most occasions. However, when he was fighting for his life at a New York hospital in 1988, Vajpayee remarked, ""Maut ki umar kya hai? Do pal bhi nahi, Zindagi silsila, aaj kal ki nahi. Main ji bhar jiya, main mann se maroon. Lautkar aaoonga, kooch se kyun daroon? (what is the age of death? Not even a few moments. Life is a journey, not a day-long affair. I have lived life to the fullest, I will die happily. I will return, why should I fear the end?).

There are cubes and cylinders here. But this is no maths class. There are bugs and a big scorpion too, yet this is no forest. Buddha and Christ almost facing each other, not in any place of worship though. This is Bengaluru's most famous cake show, that happens at St Joseph's Grounds every year, in this season. If you are a Bengalurean or have been here for a couple of Christmas seasons now, chances are that you would have visited this show.

It was sheer chance that saw me near the gates of St. Joseph's School on a Thursday evening this December. Seeing an arrow pointing to the Cake Show venue, I walked up to the counter and bought myself a ticket costing Rs. 70/-.

As I stepped into the temporary tent-like construction, I was welcomed by the front façade of the iconic Red Fort with the Indian tricolour gently fluttering in the breeze. I was to learn later that the entire model was made completely of sugar. Right next to it was an elaborate multi-tiered wedding cake which has been designed by C Ramachandran of the Nilgiri Dairy Farm. As I walked further in, I got to see 20 other cakes.

Penguins on Snow, Genie, Chinese Pagoda, Butterfly Fairy Doll, Wishing Well, Sewing Dhaaga, Buddha - Water and Succulent Garden, Joker for Joy / Jack in the Box, Christmas Snowman, Moana Wave, Natural Disaster, Christ the Redeemer and more, all fitting this year's theme, 'Water and Earth'.

The history of the cake show is interesting. The first ever cake show was held at the Nilgiris Department Store on Brigade Road in 1970. It consisted of a single 14-inch high sugar model of the Eiffel Tower made by Ramachandran C. A confectioner himself, Ramachandran got inspired by sugar models on display in Europe (Belgium and West Germany) and tried something similar in Bengaluru.

The number of visitors to the store to see the model resulted in the cake show becoming an annual feature at the shop with the number of cakes and sizes increasing gradually. Later it got shifted to St Joseph's grounds. This year it is the 44th cake show in progress.

Each show has one big centre-piece and 20 odd relatively smaller cakes. The former is made completely of sugar and is to scale. The biggest model ever made was in the year 1995 -- the 25th year of the cake show. It was of the Vidhana Soudha - 70 feet long, 35 feet wide and 22 feet high. Made completely of sugar, it was built without any support.

The centre piece has often been also an ode to some event. For example, Twin Towers (USA) was the main exhibit in the year of 9/11. The movie Titanic was released during the end of 1997 and the centre piece the following year was the ship.

Centre pieces in the past have included a Vintage Car, a Merry-go-Round, a Giant wheel, a 10-foot high Eiffel Tower, the Public Utility Building (1986), the London Bridge (1991), Taj Mahal, Mysore Palace, Bangalore Palace, Charminar, a Church, a five-sided (pentagon shaped) building depicting unity among different religions, etc.

M/s Gopalakrishnan Chenniappan and Ramachandran C from the family established the erstwhile Nilgiri's Supermarket Chain in 1905. According to Gopalakrishnan C, the annual cake show ""...is an event in Bangalore for the public to go to. Bangalore did not have much of entertainment in the earlier days and this was a big event (during Christmas season) for people to go and spend some time.""

Ramachandran C is the architect of the cake show and was the one who visualised the show in the late 1960s. He liked working with sugar from when he was in high school. ""We had our own bakery. Those days, we had some bakers and confectioners who had been working during the British time. They continued to work with us. I learnt sugar art from them,"" he said, reminiscing about the early days.

What does it take to preparing for the show? He said: 'We normally used to start three months ahead of the exhibition. One centre-piece and the other exhibits, 15 - 20 items, would be decided upon based on different interests. Weather is often a problem. Sugar is hygroscopic and absorbs moisture. We use heaters to keep the exhibits warm so that no moisture is absorbed by them. Otherwise, we have not had any major problems. Transportation could be a problem - one or two pieces may break. We always make something extra keeping this in mind.""

The family has continued the tradition of the cake show through their current venture Nilgiris Dairy Farm Pvt. Ltd. post the sale of Nilgiris to a UK-based firm in 2006. An event management company organises the show nowadays. The cakes were made by the bakers at Nilgiris till such time it was sold and for a few years thereafter.

Since 2011, most of the cakes are made by the students, teachers and trainers of the Institute of Baking and Cake Art (IBCA), Bengaluru, with some guidance from Ramachandran. At least one cake made by him is displayed each year.

While it was passion that drove Ramachandran to start the cake show, the reason for IBCA partnering with him was the commitment to its students' learning. Manish Gaur of IBCA shared how the Institute has been an integral part of the show since 2011.

Manish Gaur says: 'We have been teaching sugar art and sugar craft quite extensively. We have always challenged ourselves to excel in the learning and passing the same to our students. We saw this as an extension for the student learning - to express their art in a form which can be much larger than the usual cakes which is dealt with in the class. When they go larger, the challenges are different. The students find an amazing lot of learning as the challenges are larger. That was the reason we picked it up.""

Elaborating on this, he added, ""We started with the smaller cakes. Now we are starting to go with the larger ones. We are challenging ourselves every year with new development. This year we have flexible edible fabric - it is 100% edible and made out of sugar. It is flexible and is as thin as cloth. We are able to get textures. We are able to do block printing as close to garments printing as possible. Deepika and Ranveer's caricature is one example. We have tried paper punches. We try to experiment with materials of various kinds and see how close we can get to realistic presentation. In the cake on Natural Disaster, the cyclone effect we gave on top is an Indian sweet (chiroti).""

Talking about the process involved in conceptualising the show, the theme, the number of cakes, and other matters, Manish Gaur said: ""Right now I am doing a little bit of research for 2019. The ideating starts right after the cake show. We start planning and working 4 - 5 months ahead. My team and I sketch the ideas, break them into different designs, design the components and decide on the scale of the models, plan how the components are to be made and arranged. And when we start making the components, we keep them in a dry place in order to prevent sugar from becoming sticky or melt."" The place needs to be full of lights, which gives the warmth the sugar requires to stay firm and dry.

There is an element of learning in every cake. The kind of materials they use, the way the materials are made, and more. Manish gives an example. ""Our edible lace could be on a Chinese Pagoda, it is there on Mr. Ramachandran's creation of the cake, it is there in the King's Table, and maybe on Moana's dress... There are these textures and techniques which we have tried putting across in each cake.""

The materials used to make the cakes this year include sugar paste, royal icing, rice crispy cake, fondant, gum paste, edible fabric, wafer paper, an Indian sweet, flexi sugar fabric, flexi-edible fabric, chocolate, flexi pour, Jelly water and pastillage sugar clay dough.

Structural material has been used where needed in order to support the cakes. According to the information provided by IBCA, 'Sugar Cake creations are made using sugar dough forms that include Fondant, Gum paste and Pastillage. Sugar dough is used for creating an art piece that's both sweet and edible. They can be modified to cater to different forms like sheeting, rolling, molding, shaping, embossing, cutting, drying, colouring and more.'

Around 2.5 - 3 lakh people come to view the cake show annually. They include locals, people from neighbouring cities and towns, and foreigners too. Needless to say, the number of people at the venue spikes during weekends and holidays.

All cakes on display are destroyed after the exhibition, largely through decomposition - these cakes cannot be consumed because of the dust that would have gathered during the show.

The way out was through a space adjacent to the cake show, much larger though, and which had various things on sale. Cake sale has become a standard feature for over a decade now ever since Nilgiris (and subsequently N Dairy Farm) entered into an agreement with the National Consumer Forum in 2004.

The show is usually held during the Christmas season, from the 3rd week of December to the 1st / 2nd of January.

As one walks out from the venue, I couldn't help but pick up from the cake stall a true-blue Christmas cake, and a couple of marzipan packets. These goodies brought back many]beautiful memories as they are, in a way, an ode to my growing up years."

With 18 stadiums within a radius of 10 km, a stretch of Noida and Greater Noida apparently has the maximum number of cricket grounds in India or may be even the entire world.

The cricket grounds are mushrooming across the riverbeds of Hindon in from Noida Sector 78 to Sector 69 and Bisrakh areas.

Ramniwas, owner of a stadium near Kisan Chowk, said, ""I turned my farm into a stadium two months ago. It is not just about making money. I have been playing cricket since my childhood and it is a kind of passion towards the game. Two people have been employed here for pitch duration and turf maintenance.""

The fertile agricultural land is now being turned into a cricket stadium with lush green turf, sheds, washrooms and canteens for players; and even flood lights for day-night matches.

The business from the stadiums has turned out to be very profitable compared to the old-school vegetable farming. Farm-turned-stadiums demand Rs 2,500-3,500 for a 25-25 over match with a canvas ball and for a leather ball, the charges are Rs 7,000-8,000 per match.

During weekends, it is hard to find a ground in case a team has not booked the space in advance.

Tirath Chandra Sharma, who owns a stadium nearby, has started installing flood lights for day-night matches. His nephew Jitendra, a cricket enthusiast who also takes care of the ground said, ""This is just the beginning. We are going to be the largest cricketing community and name of Noida will be in the history of cricket very soon.""

Though, turning such a huge area into a stadium leads to scarcity of agricultural land, it has a brighter side and the local lads are now training hard on such pitches.

Subhash Sharma, a veteran coach of a private school, said, ""During our era, there were only two turf pitches in Firozshah Kotla stadium in New Delhi. The rise of stadiums in Greater Noida is helping in rise of locals in cricket.""

Vibrant and despairing, diverse and parochial, hyper-traditional and quick to change, rural India is more than the sum of its contradictions

Let There Be Light

NIGHT VISION: Kids collecting freshly charged LED lanterns at a micro solar power station near Hardoi in UP. (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Governments are generally bigger on promises than on delivery. On rural electrification, though, PM Narendra Modi has been keen to trumpet his achievements. Modi promised that 18,452 villages that were yet to be 'electrified', out of India's 600,000 villages, would be connected to the grid in 1,000 days. On April 28 this year, he announced that the target had been achieved. Leisang, in Manipur, was the last place in the country to officially receive electricity, ""a historic day in the development journey of India"", as the prime minister tweeted. But there appears to be a difference between being 'electrified' and actually having access to electricity. Recent studies by academics show that power supply and billing in rural areas are significant hurdles, so while households are connected, are they necessarily availing the benefits of having electricity? As the photograph suggests, solar-generated power is crucial to India's commitment to clean energy. Despite solar power being cheaper than its coal-generated equivalent, and despite the rapid increase in India's solar capacity, it is still too small-scale to meet demand.

Battle for Ambedkar

Dr B.R. Ambedkar has always been a celebrated figure, the country's first law minister and architect of the Constitution. But appreciation of his legacy has become a curiously political enterprise of late. Dalits are increasingly an important aspect of the BJP's political calculations, and part of the party's outreach has been for the prime minister to talk up his personal veneration for Ambedkar. Opening a memorial for Ambedkar in April, Narendra Modi claimed that other governments (read Congress-led ones) had paid lip service to Ambedkar while doing nothing to shore up his legacy. BJP leaders, including the likes of party president Amit Shah, have made it a point to be photographed showing obeisance to Ambedkar, but is it helping the party retain the votes it won so comprehensively in 2014? Signs, particularly in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are not encouraging, with SC votes in the rural heartlands swinging comprehensively towards the Congress.

Fragile Threads

WARP 'N WEFT: Two women embroider a phulkari 'bagh' in Urdan village in the Patiala district of Punjab. (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

India's traditional textiles have been treasured by people across the globe for centuries. They brought traders and invaders to our shores and may have spun the competitive engines of the industrial revolution which would later all but vanquish them. Today, powerlooms provide some 70 per cent of all Indian fabrics. Yet an astonishing diversity of handloom and handicraft fabrics survives in the Indian countryside, most of it produced by women weavers and embroiderers. While the state has played an important role in preserving these livelihoods-for example, by winning GI or Geographical Indication certification for the phulkari embroidery of Punjab-government policies can also endanger this fragile sector. The roughshod implementation of new GST rules proved a particular threat to the delicate economy of handloom weavers in small towns and villages.

Transports of Delight

The bail gaadi or bullock cart was perhaps the most persistent emblem of rural India-for a couple of thousand years. In the 20th century, the infernal combustion and horsepower of motorised transport made steady inroads into that romantic image. It's a transformation that has moved so fast that younger generations will probably view this image of a 'Tempo' taxi (right) in rural UP with nostalgia. The bhat-suwar, as it is fondly remembered in North India, along with its fellow travellers like the hand-made 'Marutas' of UP or 'vans' of Bengal, is now giving way to new models such as the chhota haathi (the Tata Ace), the Mahindra Jeeto or the Ashok Leyland Dost, as major corporations rediscover rural markets. Tata, for example, saw its rural sales expand by 38 per cent this year-almost twice its growth in urban markets.

Cock-fighting, popular around the country, is just as cruel, and arguably even more vicious than the bull-taming exercise, jallikattu. Both 'pastimes' are banned by the courts. But advocates have successfully argued that on some occasions, particularly on temple premises, cockfights ""held in the traditional manner"" should be permitted. The Hyderabad High Court, however, banned cockfights even during the Sankranti harvest festival in January, an order the SC upheld and led to the arrest of roosters. Yes, roosters.

Cries Over Spilled Milk

Farmer anger has been a major story of recent years. And it's still building. Protests have been numerous and vociferous, with thousands marching through New Delhi just last month. Many analysts argue that agrarian distress contributed substantially to the BJP's damaging defeats in the five recent assembly elections. In the past two summers, farmers across the country threw their milk onto the streets in protest at falling prices. Farmers have been demanding greater subsidies to prop up their increasingly meagre earnings. Before milk was being thrown in the streets, it was vegetables and sugarcane. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau show an eight-fold increase in farmer protests between 2014 and 2016. Solutions beyond loan waivers and fiddling with minimum support prices are thin on the ground. Climate change and dwindling groundwater supplies mean the future holds little promise of a 'technological fix'. With a looming general election, politicians are likely to continue to offer financial quick fixes. But a serious conversation about an agrarian crisis that is claiming the lives of thousands of farmers each year is long overdue.

Striking Oil

BUBBLING AWAY: Vedanta's Mangala oil processing terminal in Barmer district, Rajasthan. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Little used to happen in Barmer, a dusty, yawning stretch of Rajasthan desert- one of the country's biggest parliamentary constituencies in terms of area- barring the odd cattle fair. In 2004, though, over three billion barrels worth of oil was discovered to be lying under the sands, causing a sudden surge in excitement, and demand for such things as upmarket hotels and luxury cars. In October this year, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources, the mining company, agreed to a 10-year extension of its contract to produce oil from the Mangala area. Since 2013, Pachpadra, another village in Barmer, has been waiting for a refinery and the promise of wealth and jobs. In July, eight people were arrested for conspiring to steal 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Barmer fields and sell it on for Rs 25 per barrel. Nice work if you can get it?

In the Name of the Cow

RED MEAT: A lull in the fatal lynching of Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh, Jharkhand, June 2017. (Photo: Somnath Sen)

Conservative estimates suggest that some 30 people have now been killed by 'gau rakshaks' since 2014, the attackers apparently emboldened by government moves to penalise cow slaughter. Among those lynched was Alimuddin Ansari in Jharkhand last year. Eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime by a fast-track court in March. Out on bail, the men were warmly received by their local MP, a Union minister, at his official residence. Earlier this month, in Bulandshahr, an alleged case of cow slaughter led to riots in which a police inspector was shot in the head. As a result of the new wave of 'cow protection', many farmers, unable to feed cows that no longer give milk, have turned their animals loose. Government shelters, such as the one in the picture in Madhya Pradesh, are filled to capacity.

Healthcare on the Hoof

TAKE YOUR PILLS: State-sponsored medical check-ups in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

One of the more irritating cliches about India is that it is the land of jugaad, a land where everyone can fashion a bandage out of rags to staunch the bleeding, if only temporarily. And then along comes a picture like this and you have to acknowledge the cliches exist for a reason. For some years now, the government has made certain basic diagnostic tests free of charge. Drugs and diagnostic tests make up as much as 70 per cent of the costs that push millions of people below the poverty line in India each year. To get tests done, people have to go to their nearest clinics, though 'nearest' is a relative term in rural India. Vans were perhaps what they had in mind. But, for these patients in a village in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, a camel will do just as well.

The Maggi Index

India has had over two decades of solid economic growth. Disposable incomes have been rising, if faster in some places and for some people than others. And people all over the country, not just in the metropolitan centres, have access to and want a part of the consumer lifestyle. The scene in this photograph is an example of the spread of 'cityfied' lifestyles. The phenomenal popularity of Maggi in India has always been something of an oddity. The nutrition may be questionable, but Maggi became an urban staple. And perhaps, as a sign of the inexorable march of urbanisation and urban habits, a rural one too.

Business of Beauty

TRADE SECRETS: Beautician Puneeta on a home visit to a client in Malikpur village near Sonepat, Haryana. (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)

Economic growth may be robust, but jobs remain hard to come by. The government has suggested that self-employment might be the way of the future. This is, of course, a familiar experience for many Indians, particularly those who live in rural India. The great majority of Indians, urban and rural, work in the casual economy. The young beautician pictured here goes door to door, providing a valued service. The salon may be makeshift but the customer isn't complaining. And even the buffaloes seem to approve.

Road to Normalcy?

In April, the now ex-chief minister of Chhattisgarh boasted that the building of roads in the state had progressed to the extent that in ""districts like Bastar and Dantewada you can now go anywhere"". Later that same month, Maoist guerrillas killed 25 CRPF men guarding the highway linking Dantewada to the Sukma district. An extensive government plan is in place to connect some of India's most remote rural areas by road, to enable these villages to participate in countrywide development. Many of these villages are in Chhattisgarh, in the 'Red Corridor' plagued by running battles between the Maoists and security forces.

Reading, Writing and Terrible arithmetic

India's record in education is a deceptive image. Despite the gains made in achieving benchmarks of universal enrolment and better gender parity in primary education in the early 2000s, recent studies have revealed that the country is failing in secondary education. The ASER study in 2017 found that 57 per cent of 14- to 18-year-olds can't solve basic division problems and a government survey in 2014 concluded that only 16 per cent of Class X students could correctly answer more than half the mathematics questions put to them. Rural students from disadvantaged communities risk higher dropout rates and poorer learning. It doesn't help that government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell from 3.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 2.6 per cent in 2016-17.

The Ghost Villages

While migration from the countryside to the cities is an ancient and universal story, it has reached stark proportions in some parts of the country. In the foothills of Uttarakhand, in particular, the phenomenon has begun to spook even the state government, which in 2017 appointed a 'Migration Commission' to look into the proliferation of bhootiya or 'ghost' villages. The commission found that some 119,000 people had abandoned their homes and agriculture, leaving some 700 villages deserted. The village pictured here, once one of the wealthiest settlements in Kumaon, has been reduced to ruins by the loss of border trade and migration to towns better integrated into the economic mainstream."

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Jayaprakash Institute of Social ChangeWhen the women were questioned, they informed the NCW Committee that the NGO workers go out and solicit donations of food and clothes for the women staying there. These shelter homes are receiving crores in funding from the Central government, and are not supposed to fund care of the women through begging for donations.Many women also complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh.The Committee found that seven of the women were intellectually disabled, and observed that this Swadhar Greh was run like a 'congested prison'.The women were not receiving proper medical care.

I wish I had more reliable sources and books within my access instead of having to search for things with no direction on the Internet.

I never went to primary school. My parents were my first teachers, helping me explore the world via ships and planes, through numerous hardbound books and countless films on VCR tapes. They also inadvertently made me comfortable with sports shoes, pants, t-shirts and jackets - clothes that maximized on utility and comfort, in those years when I grew up quickly every day. I was handed remote controlled cars and teddy bears to play with instead of petite Barbie dolls and miniature tea sets. My father taught me how to swim, my mother taught me how to read, and at that age, it was all that you would ever need. Looking back, I feel like my parents had a huge hand in making me realize my sexuality at a very early age, and not just because of these somewhat trivial clothing and lifestyle choices, but because they did not treat me as a highly gendered individual, and neither did they prod me towards a particular gender and/or direction of people.

I did eventually start going to school in a small town in Uttar Pradesh. It was quite a letdown compared to my previous classroom that spread over oceans and was not limited by four drab walls. I grew up alone, my only friends being the books that I studied and found in the library. There wasn't really much in terms of common experiences or mutual hobbies that I could talk about with anyone else. I was pretty much the prize student, getting top grades in all subjects, winning in all extra co-curricular activites and sports events I participated in.

I grew up reading comics and books whenever I could, being particularly inspired by superhero figures and characters like Wonder Woman, Doctor Who (I read the books first), Harry Potter, Eragon, Artemis Fowl, Batman, Batwoman, etc. I remember being particularly drawn to the sporty yet feminine women in the various Enid Blyton boarding school novels and other such characters in various other classics, such as Jo from Little Women. I was particularly fascinated in reading about courageous and non-conventional women in history encyclopedias, with role models like Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, Amelia Earhart, Marie Curie, Amrita Shergill, Fearless Nadia, Kalpana Chawla, to name a few. My parents had a penchant for listening to a wide range of English music, and I grew up listening to LGBTQ pop culture icons such as Cher, Barbara Streisand, Madonna, Britney Spears, Elton John, Queen, Prince, George Michael, to name a few. While I didn't realize it, and I am sure, neither have my parents even to this day, this was an essential education in LGBTQ culture that they imparted to me pretty early on in my formative years.

Towards the final few years of senior secondary school, I fell in love with a female friend of mine, and I was hated for it. Overnight, the star student who could do no wrong, became the universally joked about social outcast of the place. Life taught me for the first time, that it isn't always a good, benevolent teacher. At sixteen years of age, my soul already felt weary and old, questioning everything that was happening to her, and getting no answers in return. Murphy's Law took over my life, and my home, my health, my life, everything went sideways. I spent four miserable years, trying to kill my feelings for the straight girl crush I had, and in the process, constantly feeling horrible and hopeless about my future romantic prospects. With my family's dysfunctionality at an all time high, I lost all faith in love and marriage and finding a meaningful romantic relationship with anyone.

I dropped a year right after school. My classmates were beginning a new chapter in their lives, college, and I was just a sitting duck at my house. I was depressed, severely ill, and unable to really concentrate on anything. Towards the end of that one year, my uncle decided to whisk me away to Singapore, where he lived, to cheer me up. My parents did help me with my medical expenses and trips to the doctor, but they didn't facilitate the safe, sensitized environment I needed for recovering. For the most part, I was happy that I was getting out somewhere, even if it was only temporary.

Those two months taught me to hope, to dare to dream. On my uncle's insistence, and my own anxiety about my future, I paid a visit to the university there, and I was so surprised by what I saw there, people of my age, comfortable in their skin, going about their lives, learning and living and enjoying on their own terms. I got a glimpse of what my life could be if took charge of it, so I did exactly that. I didn't want to lose out on anything else any more than I already had. I argued with my parents, and gave all those damned pre-medical entrance tests again on one condition, that I be allowed to give an entrance examination of my choice.

I qualified that examination, and entered one of the most prestigious colleges in my field in the country, as an English honours student. It was an all womens' college, and the place was literally like my own version of Themyscira. I came out to my friends, batchmates, anyone and everyone, started a queer collective, did various workshops and seminars across the university to sensitize others, met my girlfriend and the love of my life there. My life, in the words of John Green, was one exhilarating roller coaster that only went up, at that point of time. I was acquainted with the world of LGBTQ literature and authors in that space, had the opportunity to research queer themes in different works of literature and media, and interacted with numerous like-minded queer people, whether it be professors or fellow students. It was here that I discovered the works of Virginia Woolf, Patricia Highsmith, Sarah Waters, Adrienne Rich, and so many other queer female authors. It was exhilarating to find so many friends with whom I could discuss these finer details of everyday life, such as being queer, who knew of my girlfriend, even though my own parents had a hugely negative response when I came out to them in the same time. That was the first time in my life that people reacted to me coming out as gay with the same intensity they would to a mild weather change, and that was the turning point for me. I decided that I would not hide my sexuality any longer, unless it was a potential and grave violation of personal security. I should have known, there would be trying times later on.

I started my postgraduate studies in mass communication and filmmaking at one of the most reputed institutions in the country. It was a religious minority institution, and an orthodox one, and I was scared that I might have to go back into the closet again after three glorious years I spent outside of it. I was reluctantly getting ready to put on a façade, thinking of a cover story for my personal life, when one of the professors for our course walked in. My gaydar went wild, and it was such a welcome relief to see another queer individual in that building, that too, an unapologetic butch woman, that all of those previous thoughts of hiding my true identity flew right out of the window. That same professor made us watch and study a ton of queer films and documentaries, and I lived for those classes, because it helped me gain a different perspective on showcasing queerness as a potential filmmaker. A couple of weeks later, when I had settled comfortably into my new friend circle, I came out to my friends, and it felt so reassuring to do that. I found some of my closest friends in the walls of that college, and it became another home for me.

I wish I had more teachers in my life who could have helped me in coming to terms with my identity. I wish I had more reliable sources and books within my access instead of having to search for things with no direction on the Internet. I am glad the young kids today and to come will have more access to queer role models and vital information growing up, unlike me. I am happy, that I am doing my bit to make the world a better place for the children to come, and not blindly expecting them to grow up good in a horrible world. I am so happy that my current workspaces don't mind who I am or where I come from, and that is such a rejuvenating and affirmative fact to remind myself when I go to work everyday. But I still wish there were still more safe spaces for me as a queer individual, where I didn't have to fear for a homophobic backlash from people if I did come out. I wish my parents, who I still regard as the biggest teacher figures in my life, had been more supportive of my identity, among a lot of other things. I wish I had that in my first job where I undoubtedly spent some of the worst months of my life. I wish there wasn't a recurring process of coming out again and again, and that people would stop assuming I have a boyfriend just because I am a girl. I wish that our parents, our teachers, who we spend such an important and huge time with while growing up, are more sensitized to concepts of gender and sexuality, so that boys wouldn't be scolded for crying, or girls for not being a certain dolled-up kind of feminine, and I really wish our generation does better as parents.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said.

The administration's move comes days after a wall of a private school collapsed in Noida's Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three others.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work. All this is being done without creation of any rights of any type and is purely under the CSR initiative,"" he said.

As many as 580 schools in the four blocks of the district -- Bisrakh, Dadri, Dankaur and Jewar -- are up for adoption and proposals for this could be sent to the administration by January 15, 2019, the magistrate said.

""I reiterate that this will be only under the CSR initiative and all rights shall be reserved with the administration,"" Singh said.

Sarva Siksha Mission has already taken up the project of restoring the Grade IIB heritage building and the renovation work was started on Saturday. The state government has already identified this school, where an English medium primary section will be started from the next academic year along with the existing Bengali medium section.

Chairman of Sarva Siksha Mission and primary school council, Kartik Manna, said: ""The project of restoring the heritage school was taken up under the initiative of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and education minister Partha

Chatterjee. At present, we are renovating three rooms, where classes will be held from January 2. Gradually, we will renovate and restoretheentirebuilding."" Manna also said that the belongings of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar will also be preserved and kept on the school premises.

Three teachers have already been recruited for the English medium section of the school. Teacher-in-charge Ritopa Bhattacharya is happy with how things have taken shape. She thanked the state government for its timely intervention, which will not only save the school but also the ageold building. She felt that with 25 students, the future of the school looked bleak. ""But the decision to open an English medium section and restore the age-old institution is like a ray of hope,"" she added.

Despite being a heritage building, KMC pulled down a dilapidated portion of the Burrabazar branch of the Metropolitan Institution on April7 as it posed threat to public. But a timely intervention of the residents and the members of Purono Kolkata'r Golpo (PKG), a Facebook group, saved the building from demolition.

Swarnali Chattopadhyay, admin of the group, said, ""It is a proud moment for us as our initiative of restoring Metropolitan Institution has finally paid off. We proved that common citizens can do wonders if there is a will to bring about a change.""

Ellora Saha, councillor of the area, said it was her duty to restore the glory of the school. ""On Friday, I got the news of the school's restoration and was very happy. Since there has been a long-standing demand for an English medium school in the area, I think it will do well in the locality,"" said Saha."

In a flood of new releases, Aquaman easily swam past Mary Poppins Returns and Bumblebee to lead the busy pre-Christmas weekend with an estimated 67.4 million dollars over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.

Without a Star Wars film on the December schedule for the first time in four years, a crowded slate of films sought to capitalize on the lucrative holiday period in theatres.

The DC Comics superhero film Aquaman, which cost Warner Bros 200 million dollars to make, arrived already a juggernaut overseas, where it has grossed more than 400 million dollars in three weeks of release. Including advance previews, the Jason Momoa-led Aquaman reeled in 72.1 million dollars in U.S. and Canada theatres, bringing its global total to 482.8 million dollars.

Aquaman, directed by James Wan, has proven to be a stabilizing Justice League spinoff for Warner Bros following bumpier DC releases outside of Wonder Woman. The film garnered an A-minus Cinemascore from audiences.

For the studios, the weekend was as much about setting themselves up for Christmas to New Year's, when theatres are routinely packed through the week. With Christmas falling on a Tuesday, studio executives said the weekend was an unpredictable and distraction-filled one, competing with some of the busiest shopping days of the year.

""We really kick off starting Tuesday,"" said Warner Bros distribution chief Jeff Goldstein, who said the Aquaman performance came in just above the studio's 65 million dollars forecast. ""With kids not really returning to school until January 7, this aligns the stars for us in a really positive way.""

Returns were more modest for Disney's Mary Poppins sequel and Paramount's Transformers spinoff, though each had reason to expect strong business through the holidays.

Mary Poppins Returns, starring Emily Blunt and directed by Rob Marshall, debuted with 22.2 million dollars over the weekend and 31 million dollars since opening Wednesday. That was on the low side of expectations for the musical, which cost 130 million dollars to make.

May Poppins Returns, which co-stars Lin-Manuel Miranda, will depend heavily on legs through the holiday season. On its side are good if not spectacular reviews (77 per cent fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), an A-minus CinemaScore from moviegoers and four Golden Globe nominations.

""It's a great weekend to start yourself off on a launch pad into the holiday period,"" said Cathleen Taff, head of distribution for Disney. ""We're looking forward to great word of mouth building over the next few weeks. And we're looking forward to a long run.""

Poppins still narrowly edged Bumblebee, which opened with 21 million dollars. That, too, is a soft beginning for a film that cost about 135 million dollars to make after tax credits. It's also far off the pace of the Transformers films, the last of which (Transformers: The Last Knight) debuted with 44.7 million dollars in summer 2017.

But Bumblebee, a Transformers prequel directed by Travis Knight and starring Hailee Steinfeld, has something the Michael Bay films never had: good reviews. Bumblebee was the weekend's most acclaimed new wide release with a 94 per cent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences also gave it an A-minus CinemaScore.

""The pre-Christmas preoccupation for moviegoers affected everyone. All movies were impacted slightly by that,"" said Kyle Davies, head of distribution for Paramount. ""It doesn't concern me. We played really well with great reactions. The game plan has always been that we're now starting that play period where people go multiple times over the next few weeks, and that's the whole point.""

""To me, this weekend was a dress rehearsal for the big push that starts Christmas Day,"" added Davies.

Also in the mix is Sony's well-reviewed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which slid to fourth in its second week with 16.7 million dollars in ticket sales. The film also made one of the best debuts for an animated release in China where it was no. 1, grossing 26.1 million dollars over the weekend.

Clint Eastwood's The Mule added 9.3 million dollars in its sophomore frame, bringing its two-week total to 35 million dollars. Bradley Cooper, who co-stars in The Mule, could also celebrate his A Star Is Born crossing 200 million dollars domestically.

Largely overlooked in the onslaught at theatres was STXfilms' Second Act, starring Jennifer Lopez. The romantic comedy debuted with an estimated 6.5 million dollars in 2,607 locations, drawing an audience that was 70 per cent female.

But the weekend's real flop was Welcome to Marwen, the Robert Zemeckis-directed fantastical drama starring Steve Carell as an imaginative man whose scale model town helps him rehabilitate after a trauma. The film, which cost at least 40 million dollars to make, earned just 2.3 million dollars in 1,900 theatres. It's the second straight flop for Universal (which teamed with DreamWorks for Marwen) following Mortal Engines. That 100 million dollar film debuted last weekend with 7.5 million dollar film in ticket sales.

Yet the weekend managed to nearly equal the box office of the same weekend last year when ""The Last Jedi"" was in its second week of release and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle opened. Ticket sales for the Star Wars-less weekend were down a mere 2.1 per cent, according to Comscore.

Year to date, the domestic box office is up 7.5 per cent and was expected to just eke past 2016's record 11.38 billion dollars sometime late Sunday or early Monday, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore.

""The collective and cumulative strength of these newcomers, particularly Aquaman, and a huge slate of holdovers gave us a stronger weekend than anyone imagined,"" Dergarabedian said. ""A superhero movie in December can make up for not having a Star Wars movie in December."""

The inclination towards a healthier lifestyle amongst the public is the primary reason driving the sales of gymnastic benches. General health benefits aside, participation in gymnastics has been on the rise among the millennial population. The rising popularity of anaerobic sports is also driving the Gymnastic Bench Market. Gymnasts are also the strongest of all Olympic athletes, owing to the kind of training they undergo.

Gymnastics is considered as one of most famous and prestigious sports categories in the Olympics. Gymnastics develops flexibility, strength, coordination, motor skills and balance. It's no wonder that those who aspire to taste Olympics glory undergo rigorous training, which often starts at an early age. For a gymnast to be successful, two things are of prime importance: the gymnast's core strength and proper equipment. One such equipment essential for strength building and initial training is the gymnastic bench.

A gymnastic bench is a structure with a wooden board and legs with hooks attached to one side, which fixes the attachment to a vault box or a wall. Gymnastic benches can be set to different inclines, allowing varying levels of exercise intensity. A gymnastic bench is designed for exercising in the sitting position, hall laying position or lying position. Gymnastic bench legs are equipped with an anti-slip rubber (usually PVC) coating to improve stability.

The use of lightweight and economic gymnastic benches as an alternative to traditional ones is trending in schools. These are manufactured from a differently chosen, light timber.

There has been a lot of debate about long-term effects of gymnastics in an athlete's body, particularly women. Stress fractures are common amongst gymnasts and such issues hinder gymnast participation and consequently, gymnastic bench sales.

Funerals speak volumes about the deceased. When the mortal remains of Dr S Jayachandran, 71, the '₹5 doctor' of North Chennai, were placed at his home last week, hundreds and hundreds of everyday people poured in -- including fisherfolk, rickshaw pullers, daily-wagers and conservancy workers. The doctor touched countless lives during his four decades of practice in Kasimedu and Old Washermanpet. He charged next to nothing for consultation, but that's not the only reason he was loved deeply by the people of North Chennai. K Vinoth, founder, Ocean Awareness, was close to Jayachandran, and speaks of him in a voice choked with tears.

Appa saved my life some 25 years ago, when I had malaria. He came to the rescue of my daughter, when she fell seriously ill when she was six days old. He had clinics at three different places over his 25 years of practice in Kasimedu, and later started practicing from his home on Venkatachalam Street in Old Washermanpet. Initially, he charged ₹2 for consultation, which went up to ₹5. Those who could afford it, paid ₹20.

He had a soft corner for fisherfolk; I don't know why. He often said we were always working hard. I'm a fisherman's son and he treated me like his own. He is the brain behind Ocean Awareness; it is he who suggested that we clean up our beaches, set up baywatch towers, and hold marathons in North Chennai. He was constantly thinking of ways to uplift our people; he told youngsters to speak kindly, and not raise our voices even when angry.

He dreamt of building a school for children of fisherfolk. ""Edhachum pannanum da (We should do something for them),"" he said. I'm sure we will build the school he envisioned.

He was diabetic, but happily ate chocolates if his young patients offered him. ""They will be disappointed if I don't eat it; there's so much love in that one chocolate,"" he would say.

Whether or not he ate at weddings of the rich, he made it a point to eat at weddings of the less privileged. We were at one such wedding and I asked if there were no vegetables with rasam rice. He got very upset with me; he asked me to be respectful of our guest's humble efforts.

He spoke with so much familiarity with everyone. He's rapped my head with his examination torch when I told him I skipped my medicines.

He kept working all his life; he has conducted over 4,000 free medical camps across India. He never took care of his health, though. If I pointed this out to him, he told me that he should die suddenly one day, when he was practicing. His words came true.

Rag pickers, conservancy workers thronged his clinic. I remember he once asked a patient to get a scan done. ""Here, take this ₹800. The scan centre will charge more, but tell him I sent you,"" he told the patient."

Unlike a majority of the schools in the city, the Green Acres Academy is located on a road that was opened to the general public as recently as six months ago. Though the school takes its fair share of measures to minimise traffic congestion in front of the school's entrance, local residents complain that parents of students often park in front of their society's gates while they wait for their children.

Parents worry about children crossing the road to board buses even as cars drive by disregarding the school guard. Pics/Sameer Markande

The school currently has students from class I to class VII. The administration has implemented a system wherein students who have opted for the bus service board the school buses that are parked on either side of the road at 2:45 pm. The remaining students who are picked up by their parents have to wait inside the school building and are allowed to leave only after the school buses have departed by 3:15 pm. During this time, vehicles pile up in front of the school gate and traffic moves slowly for a period of 15-20 minutes.

The narrow road which is close to housing societies

Parents voiced their concern about children crossing the road to board the buses even as cars drive by disregarding the school guard. The problems increase during the monsoon season when parents tend to park as close as possible to the gate to ensure their children don't get wet in the rain which adds to the traffic congestion. The school will soon extend its classes till class X and local residents feel that a higher number of students will inevitably add to the traffic problem.

The school is located on a road that connects SG Barve Marg and Ramakrishna Chemburkar Marg which allows residents of Chembur and Kurla to use Sion-Trombay Road to move towards the Eastern Freeway.

Until six months ago, the road was private and blocked by a wall. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, demolished the wall and the road was thrown open to traffic. Local residents are now concerned that once more people start using this road, and the increasing number of students, the traffic issues will get worse.

DirectorSpeak

Aaditya Lohana,

Executive director of the school

'Our system is not very different from that followed by thousands of schools across the country. We have segregated the timings. Parents who come to pick up their children have been given a separate time which is after school buses have left. Parents park their vehicles 300-400 metres away and then walk to the school gate. Most neighbours have no concerns. But we are harassed by a self-interested group of people. We always follow laws and will continue to do so and provide the best education for the children of Chembur'

PoliceSpeak

Dr Saurabh Tripathi,

Deputy Commissioner of Police

'Parking in front of the gate is illegal and we will look into the issue. But as part of the long-term planning of the road will be taken up with local resident groups and school administration. If the school has additional students then additional parking to accommodate vehicles will also have to be arranged'

Voices

Ashwini Prabhu,

A parent

'Earlier this road was closed so there were no safety concerns for the children. But now vehicles use the road when children walk towards their buses. All buses should be parked on the same side as the school gate so that kids don't have to cross the road at all.'

Vishnu Shelar,

A shopkeeper

'When the school begins and ends, the traffic lasts for about half an hour, but clears up quickly. But parents park their cars in front of the gates of residential buildings which is inconvenient for people in the morning when they have to leave for work.'

Hemal Shah,

A local resident

'This used to be a service road. But after our society complained to the BMC as drunkards loitered in the area, they broke the wall and it was opened up. The parents must understand that there is a traffic issue here. They should opt for school buses instead of coming to pick up their children in cars. The traffic police should mark no parking zones. There are no proper footpaths which makes it difficult for pedestrians.'

Major problems

* Parents park their vehicles in front of the gates of residential buildings near the school

* Children cross the road to board their buses

* School van drivers take a long queue of students down the road to board vehicle

* Residents are concerned of the near future when more people find that the road is open to the public"

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

That was true for Nicholas II of Russia, the last ruler of the 300-year-long Romanov dynasty and the subject of the exhibition ""The Reluctant Autocrat: Tsar Nicholas II,"" organized by the Georgia Museum of Art at the University of Georgia and on view there December 22 through March 17.

The museum has been building a collection of Russian art for several years and has developed several exhibitions from the gifts that make up that collection. The majority of objects in ""The Reluctant Autocrat"" come from the Parker Collection, assembled over more than four decades and including more than 2,200 separate objects. Asen Kirin, Parker Curator of Russian Art at the museum and professor of art history at UGA's Lamar Dodd School of Art, focused this exhibition on objects related to Nicholas II and his father, Alexander III. The year 2018 marks the centennial of the end of World War I and the fall of the Romanov dynasty during the Russian Revolution, which also meant the murder of Nicholas, his wife Alexandra and their five children. As such, it presents a unique opportunity to consider the relationship between the villains and heroes of history and the reality of their individual human lives.

Kirin tells the story of Nicholas' life, from his childhood as tsarevich (crown prince) to his ill-fated military command during World War I, through objects including military and court costumes, medals and orders of chivalry, lithographs, porcelain, devotional icons and the then young technology of photography. As visitors move through the galleries, they can draw connections among these items and begin to assemble a picture of the world at the time, caught between the ancient idea of the ruler as God's representative on earth and the new, modern age.

Objects from Bob Jones University Museum & Gallery and from the gift of Princess Marina Belosselsky-Belozersky Kasarda help round out that picture. The latter also make up the exhibition ""One Heart, One Way: The Journey of a Princely Art Collection,"" on view at the museum through February 10. Kirin was even able to attribute one icon borrowed from Bob Jones to a famed 15th-century painter, Theophrastos, by interpreting its signature.

Kirin's labels and wall texts bring out the human nature of the royal family, pointing out, for example, that Alexander III and his wife prepared their own simple breakfast of bread, butter, boiled eggs and coffee every morning. At the same time, they unpack the layers of meaning in objects like a copper bowl made by Fabergé as a gift (the simpler material signified frugality at the beginning of the world war) or the importance of military regiments as social networks. The result is a rich and complex portrait of a world undergoing massive change.

The exhibition is generously sponsored by the Fraser-Parker Foundation.

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school. Now, Perumanallur government girls' high school was started in the abandoned building,"" he said.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school. The government has ordered to transfer 249 girls, between class VI and class X, from Perumanallur government higher secondary school to this school, which is now Perumanallur government girls' high school. After completion of half-yearly exam holidays, the school will start functioning on January 2,"" M Dhanabaggiam, headmistress of the new school told TOI.

Mouleeswaran said, ""The school education department will soon avail loan of Rs 1.36 crore from the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), for the revived school. More classrooms will be constructed soon. The government has also promised to upgrade the school as higher secondary school soon."""

""Vidyarthi"" reads the board outside where a motley group of boys sitting on a bench outside, flash a welcoming smile and usher the visitors inside the premises.

A tidy row of rooms in a square space with ample vacant space in the middle, it has boards around displaying creative expressions of the 36 inmates of this residential set-up.

The different forms of art, representing the children's experience of the world, are on display as part of the ongoing art festival. It will conclude on December 25.

The children, spread in groups at the entrance near the main door and at the display, to guide the visitors, feel elated whenever a visitor walks in, leading them enthusiastically to their works.

No two images are alike.

There is nature's splendour like lakes and rivers, the muted charm of the dawn and the dusk, changing seasons, trees, fruits, portraits, deities and even a few personal heroes like Bhagat Singh and Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, the Argentine Marxist revolutionary.

""I have been seeing his images on Internet and wanted to try my hand at his portrait,"" said T. Balavinayak, a ninth class student.

Eleven-year-old B. Yashwanth Sai, a native of Korukallu and a student of Standard 6 is happy with the outcome of his efforts.

His painting of Lord Ganesha offering prayers to Shiva and Parvathi is eye-catching.

As one moves along, the point where the works of the senior students start becomes clear with fresh and newer ideas, shading of tonal values with graphite pencil with perfect degree of lightness, darkness or deep black shadows in the background. Some of the images have very bright colours, expressing hope, freedom and peace.

It is evident that the children have been allowed to focus on their interests - horses, cartoon characters, fairies - rather than strict traditional exercises.

""Teaching them basics of the different forms of drawing and painting is a learning experience. The boys are a disciplined lot. I teach them age-appropriate techniques and subjects that they lap up within no time,"" says Potluri Jagadeesh, their art teacher.

The 36 inmates are drawn from different villages across the district and are imparted quality education and other courses in the after-school hours besides the daily mandatory yoga and meditation.

""Vidyardhi is designed to accommodate these students who are provided with education, food, clothing and shelter besides training in soft skills, fine arts and life skills,"" says city hotelier Surendranath Majety, who, along with his paediatrician wife Madhavi Majety, invest loads of passion in this project in the capacity of the trustees of the Majety Prahaladrao Charities , which runs this home of love."

As expected, this enraged China. While the Chinese foreign ministry warned of consequences, the National People's Congress (NPC) issued a statement that the US act was against the basic norms of international relations and a gross interference in China's domestic affairs. It said that China will take ""forceful measures to resolutely safeguard its own interests"".

As everyone knows, most foreigners who seek to enter Tibet are routinely rejected, and those who do get in are forced to stay on strictly controlled official tours, where the true situation of the Tibetan people is hidden from them. And, China has never been open to any discussion on Tibet.

Of course, the new US law sounds like bullying. But it embarrasses China and hurts it internationally.

It needs to be hurt and it's high time it is bullied.

For decades, China has been getting away with whatever it wants, cocking a snook at all international fair practices, while enslaving its 1.4 billion people. With its massive economic and technological strength, and its total disregard for (perhaps incomprehension of) all human values, it is a giant threat to the future of mankind.

Let's face it. The initial stages of China's incredible economic growth were powered a great deal by history's greatest loot of intellectual property, much of it state-sponsored. With economic growth came imperial ambitions. China has been flouting all international laws in the South China Sea, invading other countries' waters, building artificial islands and militarising them. Its ""string of pearls"" strategy of establishing a zone of influence across the Indian Ocean, from the Chinese mainland to Port Sudan, encircling India, is already in action. Its Belt and Road Initiative uses the same strategy across Central Asia into Eastern Europe.

And while it grows its global empire, its repression of its own people is reaching horrifying heights. Its ""social credit system"", already in place in many areas, is supposed to be completed by 2020. Every citizen will be watched every moment. Algorithms working on rules fed into it by the state will crunch data to rate the individual's ""trustworthiness"". ""Untrustworthy"" behaviour ranges from ticketless travel, jaywalking, smoking in non-smoking areas, playing too many video games (you are an idle person and the Chinese state does not condone idleness), not walking your dog on a leash or letting it bark too much and, of course, any talk or social media posts that hint at criticism of the state.

Punishments range from travel bans, no bank loans, job loss, denying your children a good education, and being publicly shamed as a bad citizen by having your face and name plastered on billboards. According to a State Council policy document: ""If trust is broken in one place, restrictions are imposed everywhere.""

One does not have to read a lot of dystopian science fiction to imagine to what level such measures can be taken to create a nightmarish unfree society in the future. But that society already exists in Xinjiang in northwestern China. This is where about 10 million Uighurs live, a non-Chinese minority that practices a moderate form of Sunni Islam. The Chinese have been carrying out a ""de-extremification"" project in Xinjiang for years. Today, more than one million Uighurs are in ""re-education camps"" where inmates are subjected to brainwashing -- learning Communist texts and singing songs praising the Chinese state and supreme leader Xi Jinping. Torture is common. And ""enrolment"" in these camps is often arbitrary -- local authorities are given target numbers and people are picked up randomly and imprisoned.

There is one police station per 500 Uighurs. No one can move in or out of any village or town without having their identification cards checked. Facial recognition technology is used to track residents' movements. All cellphones are collected periodically to download information from them. All Uighur passports have been confiscated. It is illegal not to watch state television.

The government has banned certain Muslim names for babies. For instance, if parents name a baby ""Mohammad"" or ""Islam"", the child will not get a school admission. Young men are not allowed to grow beards. No one is allowed to have ""abnormally long beards"". The government actively encourages drinking and smoking, since the more devout among the Muslims are abstemious.

The man in charge is a Communist Party boss called Chen Quanguo, whose last job, not surprisingly, was restoring order and control in Tibet.

The Saudi Arabians, who spend millions of petrodollars every year to promote Wahhabism across the world, are remarkably silent about the plight of their Muslim brethren in China.

US trade sanctions are hurting China, whose economy had already started slowing down. Trump is not a statesman by any stretch of imagination, but he is the first US president to have had the guts to take on the evil dragon head-on. For yes, this dragon is evil. And the more powerful it gets, the worse it will be for the world."

One morning in November, Khetrabasi Behera, 69, and his wife Kausalya Behera, 60, crossed a crocodile-infested creek in the midst of Odisha's Bhitarkanika National Park, on the way to the village they once called home.

Kausalya Behera carried some kerosene in a bottle, and her husband had a few belongings in plastic sacks hanging from a pole slung across his shoulder. The couple planned to stay in the village for a week to fish, their only means of livelihood left in a place waiting to be devoured by the Bay of Bengal.

""With our crop land lost to the sea, we are landless now,"" said Khetrabasi Behera, who wore a white shirt and a lungi folded up to his knees. ""We go to Satabhaya to catch fish, crab and prawn. We have to eke out our living.""

The couple were about 8 km away from Satabhaya, a once picturesque coastal village in Kendrapara district from which they had been relocated by the state government last year. They were among 571 families who had been resettled by April in Bagapatia, a colony created by the government for people displaced by coastal erosion in the area.

But since there are no jobs or alternative livelihoods in the settlement for the villagers, and neither has the state government provided them with land to cultivate, or compensation for fields lost to the sea, most of the resettled villagers earn their livelihoods by catching fish, crabs and prawns from the inundated fields where they used to grow paddy not so long ago. Most of them walk 12 km to Satabhaya village, and back, almost every day for this. During their visits, they also attend to their cows and buffaloes who have been left behind to graze on land that turns more saline each year.

The sea has been eroding the coastline in Kendrapara district for decades, contaminating groundwater and devouring villages and paddy fields that have provided homes and incomes to thousands of people. The erosion is particularly acute near Satabhaya village.

In a report released in July, the National Centre for Coastal Research, which surveyed 6,031 km of India's 7,517 km coastline between 1999 and 2016, found that 33% of the coast witnessed erosion, most of it on the Bay of Bengal side. Odisha alone has lost 28% of its 485 km coastline during this period, according to the report.

Ranjan Panda, a water activist and researcher in Odisha, said that the situation in Satabhaya is a test of how the government is responding to the rise in the sea level and its impact on coastal residents.

Though the coastal erosion is largely attributed to climate change, many environmentalists suspect that development projects in the 1960s such as the construction of the Paradip Port - just over 80 km from Satabhaya - and the felling of mangroves for other development projects, may have aggravated the process. No proper studies, however, have been taken up in this regard.

""Though global warming has undeniably affected erosion across the world, at the local level, as in the case of Satabhaya, the contribution of development activities at eco-sensitive coastal zones cannot be ruled out,"" said Ranjan Panda.

The word ""satabhaya"" means seven brothers. This refers to the seven villages that stood here originally, which had a robust economy revolving around agriculture and fishing, according to villagers. Tehsil records show that these villages were called Sanagahiramatha, Mohanpur, Habeli Chintamanipur, Gobindpur, Kaduanasi, Saheb Nagar and Paramanandapur. They were spread across 875.16 acres of land (not including cropland).

But as the sea relentlessly eroded the coastline, starting from the 1960s, the people of these seven villages moved inland and formed five newer villages - Kanhupur, Satabhaya, Barahipur, Rabindrapalli and Magarakanda. Satabhaya was the gram panchayat headquarters. Today, of these five villages, only Satabhaya remains. The last village to disappear into the sea was Kanhupur, in 2011. Gone with these villages were around 600 houses, more than 2,400 acres of paddy fields, several temples, a 125-year-old high school and a summer palace belonging to local royalty.

As the erosion continued, the presence of the Bhitarkanika National Park and the Gahirmatha Marine Sanctuary on their western periphery meant that the villagers could not move further inland. This is when the government decided to relocate them to Bagapatia.

Many village residents say they have been displaced multiple times because of the ingression of the sea.

Kalindi Charan Behera, 79, who now lives in Bagapatia, said he must have shifted homes 10 times during his lifetime.

Another village elder, Krusna Chandra Behera, has vivid memories of how the topography in the region has changed since he was young boy. ""I clearly remember that between 1943 and 1945, waves from the sea started pushing enormous [amounts of] sand from the beach into the palace,"" said the 84-year-old former teacher who moved to his newly-constructed concrete house in Bagapatia in July 2017. ""Initially the king tried to clear the palace of the sand deposits...But then he saw the futility of the exercise and abandoned the structure completely.""

By 1948, the palace was submerged.

At that time, the Panchubarahi temple, home to Satabhaya's presiding deities, was more than a kilometre away from the sea. Now the beach is less than 50 meters away from the temple. The deities too were shifted to Bagapatia in April.

The Odisha government woke up to the reality of sea erosion in the area about 15 years ago, when it came up with a plan to rehabilitate the villages at Bagapatia, which was then a 100-odd acre plot of marshy land from where several prawn farms operated.

Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik laid the foundation stone for the colony in 2002 but things did not move for several years after that. Land acquisition did not begin for about eight years due to complications related to acquiring a chunk of private land. At the same time, the government stopped all development activities in Satabhaya. The reasoning for this was that it was no point wasting money on a village that was destined to be abandoned.

In the mid-2000s, the slow process of relocation and lack of development in Satabhaya forced more than half of its total population of 3,000 residents - that is, those who could afford it - to move out to Okilapala, located 10 km away near the highway.

The villagers who were relocated by April did so with government assistance. According to Nihar Ranjan Mallick, the tehsildar (land revenue officer) of Rajnagar tehsil, which Bagapatia is part of, the state government has provided each resettled family with plots measuring just over 400 sq m and financial assistance of Rs 1.35 lakh to construct their houses. He added that the state government has also built a high school, a cyclone shelter and a market complex in the colony and provided it with piped drinking water through the rural water supply and sanitation department.

The new colony is a barren blend of concrete and thatched houses, a sharp contrast to Satabhaya's picture-postcard views. Its residents criticise its lack of infrastructure. They say drinking water, for instance, is provided for just 30 minutes every day.

But government officials do not seem too sympathetic to their complaints.

""The people expect the government to do everything,"" said Mandardhara Mahalik, the Rajnagar block development officer responsible for infrastructure, rehabilitation and development in Bagapatia. ""In such rehabilitation programmes, the support of the people is also vital.""

Mahalik said that the government has connected homes with piped water and is developing infrastructure such as ponds, roads and other amenities. He added that the majority of families from the village have now been relocated and any problems in the colony would be resolved soon.

Ranjan Panda said that people who are internally displaced by the impacts of climate change struggle for recognition and redress across the world because there is no immediacy to their plight. ""The government considers such people just as any other displaced people,"" he said, referring to those displaced by mining or other development projects. ""Except for normal revenue laws, there are no specific laws to categorise these kinds of displaced people and evaluate the quantum of loss they suffer in terms of livelihood.""

The rehabilitation process in Satabhaya is still not over, with a few people still living in the village.

Revenue officers tasked with identifying the land for relocation and enumerating the beneficiaries, say that the list of families to be relocated was prepared taking 2011 as the base. But in the last seven years those numbers have expanded due to marriages and births. After examining claims and physical enumeration two years ago, the state administration recommended that another 148 families still living in Satabhaya be relocated to the new colony.

Unable to cope without basic amenities in Satabhaya, some families that have not been relocated officially have shifted to homes of their relatives in Bagapatia. Some others have sent their children to live with friends and relatives in the resettlement colony so that they can attend school.

The Satabhaya gram panchayat office now operates from Bagapatia. People still living in the village have to travel here to collect their rations under the public distribution system, as well as to access their pensions and other state entitlements.

In the late 1990s, local wildlife authorities declared Satabhaya a wildlife zone and banned fishing, further diminishing available livelihood opportunities. The residents of Satabhaya then started migrating locally to look for work.

But as crop land and the lack of infrastructure to transport agricultural products to markets outside Satabhaya continued to shrink, youth began migrating further away, for instance, to plywood factories in Kerala. ""At least 400 youth of Satabhaya are in Kerala now,"" said Kailash Mallick, who also works in Kerala but had returned to Bagapatia temporarily after floods ravaged the state in August. ""They all work in plywood factories earning between Rs 5,000 and Rs 10,000 per month.""

Khetrabasi and Kausalya Behera's two adult sons are also working in the southern state. They send their parents back around Rs 1,000 every month, which just about covers the cost of their monthly groceries.

Manorama Behera's husband Jagabandhu Behera is in Kerala too. The couple have not been allotted a plot in Bagapatia so Manorama Behera still stays in Satabhaya, living alone in a thatched hut that she painstakingly repairs with mud periodically to prevent it from collapsing. Her two sons live in the resettlement colony with her brother-in-law so that they can attend school. The family once owned five acres of land, which have been claimed by the sea.

With most people gone, it is difficult to live in the village, said Manorama Behera. ""The tube wells, our only sources of drinking water, are getting defunct,"" she said.

In the last 20 years, at least 10 tube wells in the area have been damaged by the ingression of the sea. One such tubewell near the beach in Satabhaya looks unlike any other because of erosion: it is a 15-feet tall pipe awkwardly jutting out of the ground; its height indicating the extent of erosion that has taken place. The villagers still collect water from this well painstakingly - a rope is tied to its handle, a pipe attached to its nozzle.

The village as such looks deserted, with its many houses and the village school building crumbling. Sand dunes cover several homes that lie near the beach. There is no electricity and the roads do not seem to have been metalled in years. But there are still some traces of life. A few mud and thatched houses are regularly maintained to keep them habitable so that those who have left - like Khetrabasi Behera and Kausalya Behera - can stay in them when they return for short periods.

The villagers know their livelihoods are shrinking fast. They cultivate shrimp in their inundated lands despite the threat of arrest and extortion by wildlife officials. They have also been selling their milch cows and buffaloes as the grazing fields turn more saline. There are now just 100 animals, down from 400 a few years back. ""Ultimately, the whole area is doomed,"" said Khetrabasi Behera. ""And with it we are too."""

Ghanaian children living in villages across the Volta region must swim or forge through at least one river daily to reach the nearest school - holding tightly onto basins with their uniforms and books. This commute is particularly dangerous during the rainy season, three months every year, when the currents run high and strong.

Over the past several decades, flooding has become one of the most harmful natural hazards in the Volta River Basin. In 2018 alone, more than 30,000 people in at least 225 communities in the Upper East and North regions have endured floods. Although no direct correlation can be made to flooding, these regions also report the lowest overall primary and secondary school attendance rates in Ghana. Not all the children know how to swim in the flood-affected regions. Those who cannot swim usually ford streams by holding onto logs and bending tree branches, risking a fall and the waters carrying them away. Children are often late for classes and tired. In some cases, parents decide that crossing rivers is too dangerous, so they simply refuse to allow their children to attend school.

Frank Darko, 27, was moved to action in 2017, after seeing a documentary and news reports about the children's plight. He invented a water bicycle to help children and others living in river regions to traverse bodies of water. ""There are no canoes to carry them,"" he notes. ""But even if there is a canoe, it is very risky as it can capsize at any time putting the life of the children in danger. The water cycle is designed to be stable on the water.""

He called his invention Chario, a name inspired by the word ""chariot"", a carriage driven primarily through horsepower, and insists the rig is safer than a canoe. It took him more than a year to come up with the concept and design the water cycle. He had other ideas at first, including building a bridge, but these proved to be beyond his financial capabilities.

Such entrepreneurial endeavors are far from singular in Ghana. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report based on a countrywide survey of more than 1,200 young people, 66% of young Ghanaians have started their own business. Most operate in the informal sector due to cost and lack of market access. The median age in Africa is around 20. More than 35% of Ghana's population is under the age of 14 - compared to the global average of 25%. In Ghana, as in other parts of Sub Saharan Africa, this is partly due to the government's inability to provide jobs for its citizens as well as an increasing demand for local innovative solutions by banks, insurance companies and manufacturing firms.

Darko's invention could be useful throughout Ghana, as many communities contend with heavy rainfall and flooding. During the two rainy seasons, in spring and autumn, children and workers often cannot reach their daily destinations. The Chario could also be useful in other countries facing similar problems, including Togo and Benin or India.

Darko used aluminum, wood and a propeller as well as cork which keeps the Chario afloat. With no financial support from either investors or the government, Darko invested around $100 out of his pocket to develop the cycle. Again, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor report, this is not unusual in Ghana, with 90% of the young people surveyed indicating they had not received government or private support.

The Chario is easy to operate and Darko says there is no need to know how to ride a bike. Other people, including a popular radio anchor, tested the water cycle at sea, although children in the Volta region have yet to try out the Chario.

The young entrepreneur is currently perfecting his model. The current version only accommodates one person, and he plans for the next one to ferry five people: ""Four at the back and the rider. The children are not going to ride the machine by themselves. Someone will carry them to and fro on the water surface. They will be at the back and the rider in front, just like a regular chariot.""

For his next version, he wants to use more expensive, durable materials for water resistance, including stainless steel, mahogany, leather and kapok, a tropical tree native to West Africa. For the new model, he is immersing the propeller to avoid splashing water onto the children or driver. This will make the device faster, lighter and more efficient. This time, he hopes to attract financial supporters for his efforts.

Darko lives in Takoradi in the Western Region of Ghana. During his final year of studies at the Takoradi Technical University, where he studied graphic design, personal financial challenges disrupted his education. In response to his invention, though, the university awarded Darko a full scholarship, giving him the opportunity to finish his studies and conceptualise inventions that might contribute to solving challenges faced by Ghanaian society and the world. The university also expressed interest in supporting Darko in improving his water cycle - and established an entrepreneurial and innovation incubator to assist all its students to explore their creative ideas and transform them into business ventures. As mentioned by former United States President Barack Obama during the 2015 Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Nairobi, Kenya, ""entrepreneurship creates new jobs and new businesses, new ways to deliver basic services, new ways of seeing the world - it is the spark of prosperity.""

Darko says he would be proud to employ other Ghanaians and contribute to reducing the unemployment toll in his country, described as a major driver for migration and brain drain. Ghana's official unemployment rate is 2.5% nationwide, with the youth unemployment rate more than double that, while the literacy rate is about 80% and GDP per capita is about $1,800. The water cycle is the young Ghanaian's first invention, but he already has several ideas for others, including using unconventional materials in the fashion industry as a designer, that he is eager to explore."

Wheeley: The main goal is: get them in the building and get them processed, and get the paperwork where it needs to go, and get them in the rack. Do it now! Aye, aye!

Recruits: Aye, aye, sir!

Narrator: The first incarnation of the Coast Guard was born in 1790. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton lobbied Congress to construct a fleet of ten large ships, or ""cutters,"" intended to enforce tariffs on vessels entering U.S. ports. In 1915, the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service merged with the U.S. Lifesaving Service to form what we know today as the United States Coast Guard. Since then, the Coast Guard has been involved in every major United States military conflict. Today, the Coast Guard has more than 40,000 men and women on active duty, and over 30,000 more serving in reserve and auxiliary capacities. And it all begins here. On a cold week in November, we spent four days at Training Center Cape May, allowing us to observe different companies at various stages of the eight-week boot camp.

Recruit: Bootcamp, itself - it is whatever you make it. You do what you're told. Yes, sir. No, sir. Aye aye, sir. And it's as simple as that.

Recruits: Aye, aye, ma'am!

Narrator: First, the new recruits are issued uniforms.

Doctor: Next in line. Come on, this way.

Narrator: And after a medical exam and standard vaccinations, the male recruits get a free haircut. Then, it's time for the initial physical fitness assessment, where the recruits have to do as many push-ups and sit-ups as they can in one minute. Finally, there's a one-and-a-half mile run. Male recruits have 14 minutes to finish the run. Female recruits have 17 minutes. Not every recruit passes on their first try, but they do get another chance.

Instructor: You have five minutes to finish this test. Most of you will finish in three minutes.

Narrator: All Coast Guard recruits have to pass a three-part swimming test.

Instructor: Go ahead, step to the edge.

Narrator: First, jumping into the pool from a six-foot platform.

Instructor: Step off!

Narrator: Then, a 100-meter swim. And last, they have to tread water for five minutes. Coast Guard recruits don't have to be expert swimmers. Remedial swimmers are allowed to wear flotation devices. After all of this physical exertion, the recruits have undoubtedly worked up an appetite... which means it's time for lunch.. Or as it's known at Cape May, ""chow."" But chow isn't a time for relaxation or chatting with your fellow recruits. In fact, it's the complete opposite.

Company Commander: What is it?

Narrator: In fact, it's the complete opposite.

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Sanchez!

Wheeley: Let's go! Move your feet! How about you move a little faster, man? Nope, nope! Get out! That's not where you sit! That's not where you sit! You have someone right there telling you where to go!

It should be one of the most relaxing times they have, you would think, but that is when all eyes are on them.

You're not special! And you didn't shave last night like we told you! A razor never touched your face! As soon as you get back from medical, I am taking you in there and ensuring that you shave!

Recruit: You probably think that you get a little break from the Company Commanders, but when you go to your seats, the Company Commanders are staring you down and asking you questions.

Petty Officer Greenwell: Tell me about a class-bravo fire. Who was Alex Haley? Tell me about Commodore Bertholf.

Narrator: Before they can eat, recruits are randomly stopped by company commanders, and tested on required Coast Guard knowledge.

Petty Officer Greenwell: Go away, Davis.

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Greenwell!

Narrator: Recruits who answer correctly are allowed to pass and eat their meals.

Petty Officer Greenwell: Carry on. Tell about Douglas Munro. It's not on the deck! Start writing!

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Greenwell!

Petty Officer Greenwell: Start writing! Start writing! Start writing!

Narrator: Those who fail to answer correctly are ordered to document their mistakes on a performance tracker, which is collected and reviewed every day by their Company Commanders.

Wheeley: It just goes to show you that there is no downtime in basic training.

Misiuda: Who the freak are you?!

Wheeley: It's a sense of urgency in everything we do. And it really, all at the end of the day is there to assist the recruits and keep them sharp.

Petty Officer Greenwell: Carry on.

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Greenwell!

Company Commander: Ah! You don't respond to ""carry on!""

Narrator: And as boot camp goes on, it doesn't get any easier outside the galley.

Misiuda: We're going outside to play some games because of some stuff that you did.

Narrator: If an individual recruit makes a mistake in boot camp, the entire company pays for it.

Misiuda: So, this is what I don't understand. I don't understand why we're in week zero six. We still have gear adrift in our damn squad bays! We still can't push in the hooks on our freaking racks - our laundry hooks! We're being lazy, Sierra, aren't we?

Recruits: Yes, Petty Officer Misiuda!

Misiuda: I'm glad you agree. Fire, fire fire!

Recruits: Fire, fire, fire!

Narrator: When recruits hear their Company Commander say, ""Fire, fire, fire,"" it often means they're about to get ""smoked.""

Misiuda: Find some real estate!

Wheeley: The ""smoke sessions,"" if you will, are the physical exertion of energy to re-instill to them that what they were doing was not the correct thing.

Recruits: Zero, one! One!

Misiuda: Stop anticipating my command! We'll just keep playing this game until you get louder! Straight out in front of you!

I was walking through their squad bays. Their racks weren't made properly. Just little, minute, attention-to-detail things that they should know as week zero six recruits, so they got punished for it.

Recruit: Getting smoked is rough. It's hard to push through sometimes, but at the end of it you feel better because you made it through You feel like It makes you stronger.

Company Commander: Get on the deck!

Misiuda: Oh, did we lose count? Do we need to start over?

Recruits: No, Petty Officer Misiuda!

Misiuda: Just do one good pushup!

Usually in this week of training, we don't really discipline them as much, but we still have to uphold standards, and if they're not meeting those standards, then that's when we use these tools.

Have we had enough?

Recruits: Yes, Petty Officer Misiuda!

Misiuda: We need to be just as tough as the Army, the Air Force, the Marines, and the Navy. So, we also have to be held up to that standard as well.

Petty Officer Gunn: Minute two-six, probation, on the quarterdeck!

Narrator: Recruits who don't meet the standards of their Company Commanders are put on probation, which is signified by wearing a red belt.

Cichosz: Are you even using your brain, Press?

Gunn: If you get put on probation, when you're falling behind the company, you have an attitude problem. You wear a red belt that says, ""I need special attention. I need extra help. I need you to put the spotlight on me for a couple of days.""

Narrator: Recruits in need of even MORE motivation enter a program known as RAMP, which stands for Recruit Attitude Motivational Program. Recruits in RAMP are required to wear a red vest.

Wheeley: RAMP is a program we have in place for the recruits who don't seem to grasp the basic fundamentals of getting on board and aligning themselves with the Coast Guard core values. It gives them a chance to step back, realize the bigger picture and that it means more than just the individuality in which brought the recruits to the training center. It's how they operate as a team and as a cohesive unit.

Narrator: When we filmed this, these recruits were completely unsupervised, and weren't being ordered by their Company Commanders.

Gunn: Get over here, Wentler! Get over here, Wentler! I don't understand why the hell everyone is counting but you! And then you cross that threshold when I can see you, then you start doing the right thing. Get over here. Get over here. Get over here.

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!

Gunn: Chair sit. Feet shoulder-width apart right now! Doing the right thing when no one's looking. Say it, you.

Recruit: Doing the right thing when no one's looking!

Gunn: Louder.

Recruit: Doing the right thing when no one's looking!

Gunn: Louder!

Recruit: Doing the right thing when no one's looking!

Gunn: Louder!

Recruit: Doing the right thing when no one's looking! Doing the right thing when no one's looking! Doing the right thing when no one's looking! Doing the right thing when no one's looking!

Gunn: Shut your mouth!

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!

Gunn: So, tell me exactly why, why you think it's okay to do whatever the hell you want, and then someone sees you and then, oops, wake up! Time for me to start doing the right thing. Not good to go! Not good to go!

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!

Gunn: Get upright!

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!

Gunn: Fly away from me!

Recruit: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!

Narrator: In addition to undergoing intense physical and psychological challenges, the recruits actually spend the bulk of their time in the classroom.

Wheeley: The Coast Guard basic training is heavy on academics. It's almost - we use the term sometimes that it's like drinking information through a fire hose.

Narrator: Recruits are trained to fight fires. This so-called ""wet room"" is used to simulate a fire on a Coast Guard cutter, giving the recruits a realistic fire-fighting scenario. The recruits are trained in marksmanship...

Recruits: Shift my rudder, aye, aye!

Narrator: And seamanship.

Instructor: We're going to practice on our knots right now, so everybody get out your lanyards really quick.

Narrator: While filming in this class, one recruit gestured towards our camera. An officer spotted this, and while the recruit was privately reprimanded for the offense, the entire company would pay the price.

Gunn: You people want to act like actual crazy people all day at seamanship? I've got a tool for that. Two zero zero seconds back on line with a full canteen. Go!

Recruits: Aye, aye, Petty Officer Gunn!"

The Bihar government's decision to redevelop Patna's prestigious PMCH by demolishing its historic buildings has upset the alumni of the state's first medical college, who have appealed to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to save the heritage of the 93-year-old institution for the posterity.

Born in 1925 as the Prince of Wales Medical College, set up to commemorate the visit of the then Prince of Wales, Edward VIII, its iconic, old heritage building are now proposed to be dismantled in multiple phases as part of a redevlopment plan.

The Prince of Wales had visited Patna on December 22-23 in 1921 as part of his royal tour of India and the college was established four years later to perpetuate the memory of his visit to what was then a young provincial capital of Bihar.

The college, renamed a few decades after Independence, as the Patna Medical College and Hospital, popularly known as PMCH, is dotted with historical buildings, including the Bankipore General Hospital and Women Hospital, which were equipped with special lifts in that era, the main administrative building, and physiology and anatomy departments, among other structures.

Advertising

The new project of the Bihar government has not gone down well with the PMCH alumni, living in Bihar or abroad, who have suggested restoring and preserving the historic institution in its original form and developing ""extension centres"" in peripheral areas of Patna, like Bihta or Fatuha, on the lines of AIIMS extension centres.

""All historic institutions endeavour to preserve their heritage for the next generation. And, the coming generation will be robbed off seeing the heritage of Bihar's first medical college. The government should preserve it,"" PMCH Alumni Association president Dr Satyajeet Kumar Singh said.

Patna-based Singh, who had worked for several years in the UK after completing his graduation, rued that the campus buildings had suffered some neglect over the last few decades, but it would be ""grossly unwise"" to demolish them and such a massive hospital in a congested area meant it would lead to ""traffic nightmares"" in streets.

The state cabinet had in November given its nod for the redevelopment of the PMCH into the world's-largest 5462-bed hospital at an estimated cost of Rs 5540 crore.

Dr Prateek Nishant, another PMCH alumnus, whose great grandfather, Tarini Prasad Sinha, was among the first-graduating batch in 1927, says the prospect of losing these ""signatures of the past"" disheartened him.

""PMCH runs in my family, my grandfather, grandmother, father did post-graduation from PMCH, and then, I graduated from it in 2017. We have still carefully preserved the degree handed out to my great grandfather, who was transferred from Calcutta Medical College when the Prince of Wales college opened,"" he told PTI.

Nishant suggested that non-harmonious buildings added after Independence can be knocked out, like, the Rajendra Surgical Block, Platinum Jubilee Auditorium and the maternity department, which are very ordinary-looking structures, and new buildings in harmony with old architectural fabric can be constructed in their place.

PMCH Principal Dr Ajit Kumar Verma, when asked about the redevelopment project, said it would be a state-of-the-art facility, with ""modular-operation theatres"" and other high-tech amenities.

The hospital will be redeveloped by the Bihar Medical Services & Infrastructure Corporation Ltd (BMSICL) on a turn-key basis. In future, there is a plan to link it with the Ganga Drive, he said.

""The project will be executed in three phases. In first phase, nurses quarters and other buildings would be demolished. As of now, only administrative building has been planned to be preserved, as it also has the old plaque of the inauguration of the college,"" he said.

The huge marble plaque, bearing the old name of the college and the Prince of Wales royal crest, installed right outside the principal's office, reads that the college was established in 1925 and formally inaugurated by the then Lt governor of Bihar and Orissa, Sir Henry Wheeler, on February 25, 1927.

PMCH alumni are spread across the world and those living in the UK and Pakistan also appealed to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to rework the plan to spare those historic buildings.

Patna-born doctor Navin Kumar, in his late 60s, who moved to London in 1982 to further his medical career, said, ""I left Patna, but my heart always hankered for these old landmarks and buildings. I am shocked that the government has even considered demolishing old PMCH. It has to be saved for the future generation.""

Karachi-based Shamim Hasnain, an alumna of PMCH, who hails from Bihar, graduated in 1976 and moved to Pakistan post her marriage soon after, says, ""The news of proposed demolition has left me dejected.""

""I entered PMCH, that time still called Prince of Wales Medical College, in 1969. Next year is the golden jubilee of our batch. Hope, I can make it to alumni meet in February 2019 and see PMCH again after ages. I appeal to the government to not demolish the old buildings,"" she said.

"267","1025069518","2018-12-23","http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2018/dec/23/hartal-malaise-its-time-to-strike-it-out-1915274.html","Hartal malaise: It's time to strike it out","The New Indian Express",FALSE,"It appears the state has had enough of the hartal malaise. For the first time in the history of Kerala a mass movement is building up against hartal which eats up around Rs 2,000 crore direct and indirect revenue of the state. Now, an anti-hartal movement is gaining momentum with numerous organisations coming out against this age-old mode of protest. The Joint Action Council Against Hartal (JACAH) hopes to put pressure on political parties to end such strikes, which paralyse normal life.

Stakeholders in sectors like industry, tourism, retail, transport, realty, hotels and education have already expressed their resentment toward hartals. The JACAH, which comprises TiE, KMA, IMA, CII, FICCI, KSSIA, coir manufacturers, Kerala Chamber of Commerce, Cochin Chamber of Commerce, Indian Chamber of Commerce, NASSCOM, KTM, CREDAI, Private Bus Owners Association, Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi, Hotel and Restaurant Association, Bakers Association and CBSE School Association, has decided to unitedly move against hartal in the state. Interestingly, there are around 10 villages in the state which do not cooperate with hartals.

Raju P Nair, who spearheads 'Say No To Hartal' campaign, said a collective effort from the public will put pressure on the political parties against announcing hartals. 'Say No To Hartal' began in 2010 and its members arrange transport facilities for those stranded on hartal days. ""Already, the public protest against hartal has forced political parties to reduce the number of state-wide hartals. Now, mostly district and regional-level strikes are being called by political outfits.

However, such a strike is an infringement of the rights of the public. So, by collective effort, the public should put pressure on political parties. There may be setbacks initially, but if the resistance lasts long, the political parties will have to give up hartals,"" said Raju, who is also the Congress DCC secretary.

According to him, during the tenure of the UDF Government, there was a study conducted about the losses incurred during a hartal. The direct loss for the government was estimated to be around Rs 900 crore from one hartal. If indirect revenue generation is taken into consideration, the loss is more than Rs 2,000 crore.

Dr S Sajikumar, Confederation of India Industry (CII) Kerala State Council chairman and MD of Dhathri Ayurveda Pvt Ltd, said the loss from the hartal is between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 crore. ""When attempts are made to attract new investors and industries to Kerala, hartals are affecting the perception of investors about the state. The production loss for the industries is severe during hartal days. The worst affected are daily wage workers. If the political parties have any consideration for these daily wage workers, they should give up this kind of protest,"" he said.

S Gopakumar, president of Better Kochi Response Group which is also part of JACAH, said attempts will be made for a political solution to tackle the hartal menace. Discussions have to be held with political parties against the total shutdown during such strikes.

""Our intention is to create a collective conscience against hartal among the public. We want the public to come out against hartals. There is a general fear among the public they will be attacked and vehicles will be destroyed. If a collective drive against hartal emerges, no one can forcefully stop people from going to work or opening shops. We are looking to counter hartal using the legal channel as well.

The person who announces a hartal should be held responsible for the damage. Insurance coverage for the destruction is under discussion which will help traders and bus operators to function during hartal days,"" he said.

Private Bus Operators Association president M B Sathyan said private buses are ready to operate on hartal days. A discussion will be held with traders' organisation over sharing the damage incurred while operating buses on a hartal day. For bus owners, the hartal is a nightmare. It is estimated a bus owner suffers a loss of Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000 from a hartal.

""A bus owner has to pay a tax of Rs 30,000 for three months, and the insurance amount is in the range of Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000. The buses are bought by taking loans from banks for which a hefty interest is paid. For operators, the daily collection is important for survival and such strikes severely affect the revenue. Political parties have nothing to lose from the hartal. Already, due to low profit, the number of private buses is coming down annually. Earlier, when there were 30,000 private transport buses in the state, it has come down to 14,000 now,"" he said.

The tourism industry is the worst hit from frequent hartals as it incurred a loss of Rs 300 crore per day. As the tourist footfalls have already come down due to the Nipah scare and the flood, the industry cannot afford frequent hartals. ""Each day, there are around 70,000 tourists staying in the state.

On a hartal day, a huge number of tourist are jailed in their hotels. After suffering from the hartal, the tourists will not prefer to visit Kerala again. During a hartal last month, a convoy of German tourist was attacked at Kozhikode. Such incidents will directly affect the tourism industry,"" Abraham George, convenor of Kerala Tourism Task Force and member of National Tourism Advisory Council, said.

Recently, tourism stakeholders held a meeting in Kochi and passed a six-point resolution to withstand hartals in future. They also decided to file contempt of court against non-implementation of directives by the Supreme Court and High Court against hartal. Kerala Vyapari Vyavasai Ekopana Samithi (KVVES) which held a meeting at Kozhikode decided to observe 2019 as a hartal-free year. KVVES president T Naseeruddin said traders will cooperate with hartals no more.

""We have directed all the traders to open the shops on a hartal day. The buses will operate and industries will function. Only a joint effort can put an end to this practice,"" he said.

Driving with headlights on during day to register protest against hartal

Kochi: In a novel way of protest, those opposed to hartal will drive their vehicles with the headlights turned on during the day on Monday. Already publicised through social media, Say No To Hartal, the organiser of the event, is looking for mass participation.

Raju P Nair, who leads Say No To Hartal, said people who are against hartal can keep the headlight of their vehicles on during the daytime. ""By joining the campaign, people are not only expressing their protest against hartal, but also emphasising protection of human rights. Every Indian citizen has the freedom to work and travel which is violated during hartals. We expect all the persons who support the campaign to keep the headlights of the motorbike, car and bigger vehicles on during the daytime on Monday,"" he said.

A vehicle rally will be carried out at Kaloor Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises protesting against hartal around 9 am. Apart from it, district-level protests will also be carried out in the coming days. Say No To Hartal has been actively campaigning against hartal for the past eight years. The campaign is gaining popularity as more number of people are joining it every year."

""I believe the Taliban will see this as a reason to stall, and therefore it disincentivizes the Taliban to actually talk to the Afghan government, which it has refused to do,"" said Bill Roggio, an Afghanistan analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on US airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate, and Afghan military officials note the announcement by the Trump administration comes as the country's security is at its worst since 2014, when more than 100,000 NATO troops pulled out of the country and handed off security to Afghans. The US and NATO retreated into a training and advising role.

""A complete withdrawal of US forces would very likely cause the Taliban to make gains in key areas throughout Afghanistan,"" Roggio said. ""This likely would cause the general collapse of the (Afghan National Security and Defense Force) as a cohesive fighting force and lead to the return of the warlords.""

President Donald Trump considers the war in Afghanistan a lost cause and has long pushed to pull the troops out. His decision was made public a mere few hours after he abruptly announced the US was withdrawing troops from Syria.

Trump's state of mind is sure to have given a sense of urgency to US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been working to reach a negotiated end to America's longest war and has been pushing for a deal by April.

In an interview with Afghanistan's TOLO TV on Thursday -- hours before the withdrawal plans were announced -- he noted Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to end the Afghan war, which has already cost Americans nearly $1 trillion. More than 2,400 American soldiers have also died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.

""There was little doubt that Ambassador Khalilzad was always working with limited time and a zeal of desperation to achieve something before the president pulled the plug,"" said Daniel Markey, senior research professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

A Taliban official told The Associated Press the announcement was a positive step. Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, the official said Taliban officials think the promised departure could help the peace process because it could ""lead to trust building that the US wants a political solution.""

But there was no sign the Taliban were ready to move on the two major sticking points: Direct talks with the Afghan government and a cease fire while the two sides negotiate Khalilzad's so-called ""roadmap for the future of Afghanistan.""

Peace talks aside, the announced withdrawal has Afghan generals and analysts worried about the ability of the beleaguered Afghan National Afghan Security Force to stave off a Taliban insurgency unfettered by US troops and their pounding air power.

The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since their ouster in 2001, controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.

Several high ranking Afghan military officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the morale of Afghanistan's undertrained and poorly equipped security forces was already at a dangerously low ebb. The troops routinely complain about reinforcements that arrive too late, equipment that fails and even running out of food.

The officials called America's withdrawal a defeat, comparing it to the US evacuation from Vietnam and Russia's 1989 forced withdrawal from Afghanistan that capped a failed 10-year campaign.

US troops invaded Afghanistan in November 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 attacks. Their ouster of the Taliban returned to power former warlords, whose bitter infighting and runaway corruption had resulted in vast tracts of the capital Kabul being destroyed and given rise to the Taliban, who used a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam to restore calm to the country.

Ordinary Afghans have mixed feelings about the presence of US and NATO troops. Many fear their departure believing it will strengthen the Taliban, yet criticize their presence for doing little to improve security, which has deteriorated. Afghans complain bitterly about their deeply corrupt government and see the US -- which largely bankrolls the government -- as responsible.

Neighbor Pakistan, who has been harshly criticized by Trump for not doing enough to bring the Taliban to the table, had warned that a sudden departure of US troops would result in chaos in Afghanistan and destabilize the region.

""The last thing it (Pakistan) wants is a radical Islamist state on its Western border, even if that eliminates or reduces Indian influence in Afghanistan,"" said Shuja Nawaz, author and fellow at the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center."

In June 2017, when newly-wed Anu­radha reached her in-laws' home in Gajipur village in Bihar's Nawada district, she was shocked to learn that while the family owned a car, they had not built a toilet in their house. Both her father and her husband, Kundan Kumar, a BTech employed in Delhi, had not revealed this fact to her before the wedding.

Forced to defecate in the open, the feisty young woman protested, fought with her husband and shifted to her parent's home until a toilet was built. But her demand faced opposition from the entire village. The aversion to toilets was rooted in the superstition that building a toilet at home would bring misfortune. So much so that the entire village did not have a single toilet. Even the facility at the government primary school had been sealed by villagers with brick and sand.

""In the eighties, two families in the village constructing toilets lost their sons to sudden illness. It created fear that building a toilet would bring misfortune,"" says Shyam Sundar Singh, a villager. ""Then in 2016, the block development officer, Radha Raman Murari, who was motivating villagers to build toilets, met with an accident. This strengthened our fears further.""

The entire village had accepted the 'tradition' of making do without toilets at home. The panchayat had even demarcated open defecation zones for men and women. ""Women had to leave their homes before sunrise, when it's still dark. It was horrible,"" recalls Anuradha.

In August 2017, Kaushal Kumar, a young IAS officer, took over as the district magistrate of Nawada. ""I was surprised to learn about the tradition in the village. But we handled it sensitively as the superstition was strong and deep-rooted,"" he says.

Kaushal visited the village with district officials and interacted with the people. The exercise was done regularly. ""It took a few months to convince villagers to build toilets,"" says Naushad Ahmed Sidiqqui, the block development officer of Akbarpur. Soon, government agencies got involved in the construction of toilets. The first one came up at the house of Anuradha's in-laws in November 2017. Soon all families followed suit. Today, every house in the village has a toilet. Gajipur has been declared open defecation-free."

More than 200 kilometres northeast of Guwahati, Balipara once was known for its tea gardens and for one of the country's premier schools-the Assam Valley School. Today, the mofussil town is gradually emerging as a manufacturing hub, with brands like Dabur and Patanjali setting up factories.

But the biggest socio-economic movement in Balipara is driven by something else. Surrounded by evergreen forests and grasslands of the Indo-Bhutan and Assam-Arunachal Pradesh borders, it is emerging as an exemplar of conservation, not only generating employment in an ecologically responsible manner, but also bringing about social reform in the process. At the centre of this is the Eastern Himalayan Botanic Ark, a unique forest restoration effort launched by Ranjit Barthakur and Prabir Banerjee.

How did it all begin? Barthakur, a corporate veteran and chairman of IPL team Rajasthan Royals, during one of his visits to a tea garden in Balipara, was pained to see massive deforestation and routine hunting of animals around the biologically sensitive zone. A swathe of almost barren land was taken on lease and afforestation started in 2005. Today, the stretch has grown into a forest zone of 21 acres, hosting diverse flora and fauna. ""The Eastern Himalayan Botanic Ark is a first-of-its-kind project in the Eastern Himalayas,"" says Barthakur. ""It seeks to become a centre for the preservation and restoration of biodiversity in the Eastern Himalayas through education, experimentation and research.""

But more than that, the project has taught villagers the importance of conservation and inspired them to join the movement. The old tea garden bungalows, which Barthakur and Banerjee converted into luxury cottages, helped them pull in tourists interested in studying or enjoying the biodiversity of the region. ""The challenge to conserve biodiversity is great, but the greater challenge is to empower the forest communities who have the opportunity to do so,"" says Barthakur.

A constant flow of tourists created jobs, which became the hook for the surrounding population to join the conservation project and make it economically viable. For instance, 27-year-old Bishkel Guwala, from Chilani Gaon, who had no permanent job, is the head chef of Ark cottages, earning

Rs 15,000 a month. Jyoti Ranpal and his family from Boragaon provide traditional food to visitors and researchers, earning up to Rs 40,000 a month. Yet, more than financial stability, people like Guwala and Ranpal have inspired hundreds in their villages to seek education and explore newer livelihood opportunities. ""I never went to school, but my children attend an English medium school,"" says Guwala.

In 2016, Baligaon Miri was declared a green village by the Indian Green Building Council, a non-profit organisation. Komission Milli, headman of the village, says, ""We have learnt more productive farming methods from experts in the Ark. We have also diversified our crops and taken up organic farming. Our income from farming has been growing.""

Saurav Malhotra, project executive with Balipara Foundation, the organisation behind the Ark, says the dissemination of traditional knowledge is two-way. ""A person like Milli is a minefield of traditional wisdom, which has immense value in developing ecologically sustainable livelihoods and building assets for local communities,"" he says. ""Focusing on local ecosystems, we are also carrying out an ethno-botanical survey of indigenous communities to record the precious cultural knowledge available over generations.""

For Barthakur, the project is just the beginning of his efforts to build a sustainable model of socio-economic development at 11 locations along the Indo-Bhutan and Assam-Arunachal borders. Balipara is witnessing that transformation with the fast expanding weekly market of organic and local products-a model praised by economist Joseph Stiglitz during his visit. Of course, there are some fringe benefits too-occasional visits by film personalities like Aamir Khan and Karan Johar."

That is where he went back in 2013, after spending three decades in the corporate world with firms such as Hindustan Unilever and the Minda Group. That year, he founded Mrida, along with Manoj Khanna and Gurveen Kaur Sood, who also had corporate experience.

Mrida focuses primarily on three areas: renewable energy in rural areas, creating market linkages for small farmers, artisans and womenfolk, and producing and marketing health and wellness products.

Mrida entered the villages with small solar installations that lit up homes and helped recharge mobile phones. In some cases, the microgrids, as they are called, were supported by corporate houses as part of their CSR (corporate social responsibility) initiatives. The nominal fee charged is pooled into a bank account, maintained by the 'village development committee'. Meanwhile, women folk are given lessons in tailoring. Those who acquire advanced skills go on to become entrepreneurs, investing in their own sewing machines. Others are employed at a centre that makes women's accessories. In Bareilly, for instance, a team of women is engaged in making muslin bags, fetching them up to Rs 20,000 a month.

Mrida also helps farmers growing millets and amaranth (a type of grain) find markets for their produce. These grains are made into either flour or cookies and sold under the brand EarthSpired. ""Right from farming to processing to packaging, there is value addition at every level,"" says Nagpal. EarthSpired is now taught as a case study of 'Building a Brand for Social Impact' at business school INSEAD. Another of their enterprises, Mrida Greens & Organics, has a processing unit in Gujarat ,which makes extracts of plants and herbs. Mrida Renergy & Development has partnered with M&M, Reliance Foundation, Rio Tinto and Hero Motors, among others, to channelise their CSR initiatives

Mrida has a footprint in 42 villages across seven states, has an annual turnover of Rs 5 crore, and has impacted 22,000 villagers so far. This year, the group is targeting a Rs 13 crore turnover, and is in talks with private equity players to raise capital."

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

Mass hysteria breaks out in India every few years and is increasingly being fuelled by paranoia about the internet.

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently - from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film - proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India - West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun - were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

Nothing like a little tongue-in-cheek humour to start your Sunday, right? Well, G. Sampath hears you and then raises you his column for The Hindu. Taking a dig at the OTT weddings of the past weeks, Sampath tells you why the Ambanis who spent a mere 0.03 per cent of their net worth on their daughter's wedding should be an example to the Indian middle class who exhaust their life's savings for the same purpose. While he's at it, Sampath- on a completely unrelated note- also takes a dig at the hundreds (at last count) cities that have been renamed this year (because, why not?!) and finally ends by telling you who made that famous dhokla that Amitabh Bachchan was seen serving at the Ambani-Piramal wedding. Read this column because we could all do with some good old satire in our lives!

Those of you who read me regularly and fantasise about the day I become a wealthy editor-CEO adept at parlaying his journalism into political influence would know that I harbour no such ambitions. This is why you'll never catch me taking selfies with the Prime Minister or with any of the clueless, powerless ministerial panjandrums who every day set a new benchmark for jobless girth.This is also why I try and stay away from high-profile weddings. Alert readers will remember that the last celebrity wedding I attended was the Virushka one in Italy, and as I explained in this column exactly a year ago, I only went because they wouldn't stop weeping on the phone. But this year I made it clear to both Priyanjonas and Deepiran that Mahalingam must go to the mountain if he wants the mountain's blessings because the mountain will not go to Mahalingam. G. Sampath in The Hindu.

Discriminating Against Migrants Isn't Just Unconstitutional, It's Also Bad Politics

In his weekly column for The Times Of India, Swaminathan Aiyar talks about the increasing trend of 'othering' migrants in different states- a trend that has been bolstered by political parties across the spectrum. Notwithstanding the fact that this is severely unconstitutional, Aiyar argues that it could also cost these parties politically. He cites the example of Gujarat where the BJP government is drafting a law forcing new projects to hire at least 80 per cent of their workers from within the state and says that this may alienate migrants from, say, Uttar Pradesh, who will elect 130 MPs to the Lok Sabha in 2019, as opposed to the 30 that will be elected from Gujarat.

Rabindranath Tagore dreamed of an era when ""the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls."" Alas, both the Congress and BJP are energetically building such narrow domestic walls.Article 15 of the Constitution says, ""The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them."" Neither Narendra Modi nor Rahul Gandhi, Vijay Rupani or Kamal Nath, can wriggle out of that. Kamal Nath protests that, whatever the Constitution may say, in practice many states have special benefits for locals, so he is following what others have long done. This amounts to arguing that because many people violate the Constitutional ban on discriminating based on religion, caste, sex or place of birth, therefore state governments are entitled to do so too. No, state governments are supposed to enforce Constitutional rules, not break them. Swaminathan Aiyar in The Times Of India

Justice, Forgiveness, And The Call To Forget

Forgive, and forget? Well, it's not that simple as Rajeev Bhargava explains in his column for The Hindu. What is forgiveness? Is it excusing a wrong? Is it compromising with evil? Or is it acknowledging the transformation of a wrong-doer from the side of the wrong to the side of the right?

These are heavy existential questions, but Bhargava breaks them down succinctly to ensure that you get your brain juices flowing this Sunday morning.

The reception of the recent judgment 34 years later once again demonstrates that victims of one-sided collective violence desperately need retributive justice, and not be deviously nudged to move on without it, to let bygones be bygones, to forget and forgive. Not surprisingly, it is perpetrators of violence or insensitive bystanders who say this. But forgetting is neither possible nor desirable. Traumatised survivors may be forced into silence but they can't forget their loss or suffering. For a start, forgetting can't be brought about intentionally; no one can wilfully strive to achieve amnesia. The more one goads oneself to forget, the more one remembers the brutality of the act and the loss of loved ones. More importantly, such a demand can't be morally justified. Rajeev Bhargava in The Hindu.

Taking On The Chowkidar, One Funny Tweet At A Time

In the context of Rahul Gandhi, the only thing more talked about than the upheaval of his political fortunes, is his upheaval on social media. In his column for The Times Of India, Abheek Barman talks about Gandhi's social media strategy and how he's taking on the Prime Minister with the one thing he arguably doesn't have: a sense of humour. Barman looks into some of Gandhi's tweets from the past year which have garnered more support than that of the Prime Minister and asks a pertinent question in the end- "" Will @narendramodi become India's first PM to be laughed out of office?""

Every voter, everywhere is used to political fibs. So about a month ago when Rahul said that if elected, state Congress governments would write off farm loans in 10 days, folks yawned. Then on December 19, he tweets: ""It's done! Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh have waived farm loans. We asked for 10 days. We did it in 2."" RT, 17,000. L, 71,000. And a panicked stampede ensues among BJP rulers of Assam and Gujarat to whitewash Rs 600 crore bad debt and Rs 650 crore unpaid power bills out of account books.Rahul steers clear of ghoulish snarls of the pearshaped Right. He gives wide berth to otiose quavers of the weedy-Left. He lacerates the powerful for neglecting, abusing and lying to those who gave them power to begin with. To take on vampire gau-rakshaks, he'll have to take down holy cows. Using humour to bite instead of abuse to bludgeon. Abheek Barman in The Times Of India.

Out Of My Mind: Bankrupt Economics

While Rahul Gandhi's debt waiver for farmers has earned him a lot of political brownie points, it does not seem to have found favour with Modi-admirer-turned-critic Lord Meghnad Desai.

Lord Desai in his column for The Indian Express calls Indian agriculture ""the sick man of the Indian economy"" and goes on to explain how decades of bad agrarian planning has brought agriculture to this situation today. He argues, therefore, that instead of being all filmy about farmers and their debts, politicians must try and rehabilitate farmers into other sustainable professions so that there are no debts that need to be waived off in the first place.

A little extreme, some would say, but we would ask you to hear him out.

Political attitudes are like old Bollywood films. They love cliches. Villains have moustaches and mothers are always full of tears. Farmers are forever poor. They are supposed to deserve our sympathy but even more the taxpayers' money. If you are a low-income earner, as an urban worker or a struggling school teacher, do not ask for debt forgiveness. If you have a mortgage and cannot keep up with your EMI, do not expect your bank or the government to cancel your debt. Not even if you are an MSME producer. Politicians have no sympathy for you. Come back as a kisan and tears well up in their eyes and you get a cheque straightaway.Lord Meghnad Desai in The Indian Express

Inside Track: Flying Baraat

So you thought that the delay in selecting the Chief Ministers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh was because of political reasons? Well then in her latest column for The Indian Express, Coomi Kapoor rubs a big LOL on your face. Apart from the politics, there was also the correct 'muhurat' as Kapoor points out and also the time that it takes to put together a political baarat.

So who were the baraatis and how were they different from the regular invitees? Kapoor breaks it down for you.

The first auspicious day after the result declaration was 17 December, the preceding five days are termed as 'panchak' and considered inauspicious according to the Hindu calendar. The three oath-taking ceremonies, in Bhopal, Jaipur and Raipur, were all held on the same day, and Rahul Gandhi took a jumbo party of a few senior Congresspersons and leaders of various alliance partners to each venue. The convoy of planes, a six-seater, an eight-seater and an 18-seater, belonged to Kamal Nath, the Jindal group and a leading industrialist of Andhra Pradesh. The CMs of each state waited for Gandhi and his contingent to arrive before taking oath. Some southern MPs were surprised at the unpunctuality since they are accustomed to chief ministers being sworn in at a very precise and carefully calculated timing, both for superstitious reasons and for meticulously adhering to the official programme. After being sworn in, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot did not even proceed to their offices to take charge, instead they flew to Chhattisgarh with the rest of the Gandhi entourage.

Five Major Political Trends From 2018

Well, its that time of the year again- the time when the year finally ends, we mean- and any observer of Indian politics will agree that 2018 has set the perfect platform for an exciting General Election in 2019. In the weekly column for the Hindustan Times, Chanakya talks about these impending elections and the five major political trends that seemed unlikely to form in the beginning of 2018, but have come to the fore (and how!) as the year draws to a close. From Rahul Gandhi finally establishing himself as a force to reckon with, to the resuscitation of Mayawati after the Uttar Pradesh election debacle- here's a summary of what went down in Indian politics this year, and how 2019 is now open-to-all.

At the beginning of the year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite scraping through to win Gujarat in late 2017, was still on a high. The opposition, especially the BJP's main rival, the Congress, appeared in tatters. The BJP looked invincible, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed a shoo-in for 2019.Modi may still be the most popular political leader in the country as the year ends, but a lot of other things have changed.The BJP is now in power in five fewer states than it was at the beginning of the year. The air of invincibility that once surrounded the party is gone. The Congress is resurgent. Through the year, it has held Parliament to hostage, belying the fact that it won a mere 44 of the 545 seats in the Lok Sabha in 2014. Chanakya in the Hindustan Times

Reviewing 2018: The Year Of India's Sporting Revolution

Politics is not the only thing that underwent a sea-change in 2018- so did India's sporting scene. In his column for the Hindustan Times, Kunal Pradhan says that this has been a 'watershed year' for Indian sports.

From Hima Das, to Shubhankar Sharma, PV Sindhu and even the Indian Men's cricket team which is now being led by a quartet of menacing fast bowlers- 2018 has been about young Indians starting their journey in global sports at a level where other Indians before them hoped to finish their career. 2019 promises some more of these sporting revolutions, says Pradhan, because unlike players of the past, these prodigies have not been swept away by their success- but see it as just the beginning of what they have set out to achieve.

The story goes that, this July, a young woman in Helsinki, Finland called her father in his village in Dhing, Assam, to tell him that she was now a junior world champion. The dad, a farmer, to whom the import of the achievement didn't immediately sink in, told her it was late and he would think about what she'd said in the morning. Hima Das, 18, told her father that he would not have any time to think in the morning because he would be too busy giving TV interviews.A couple of months before that, at the World Golf Championships in Naucalpan, Mexico, a young man approached the legendary Phil Mickelson during a practice session ahead of the decisive final round of the tournament. Mistaking him for a pesky journalist, 'Lefty' shooed him away: ""Not right now, after the round."" It look Mickelson a few seconds to realise that the young Indian before him was Shubhankar Sharma, 21, the 54-hole leader and his playing partner in the final group that day.These two sporting anecdotes, related several times over the last few months, are important to retell as we bid goodbye to 2018 because they underline why this has been a watershed year for Indian sport. Kunal Pradhan in the Hindustan Times

Paratha Vs Pepper Chicken: The Dabba Divide Is Growing

We leave you with this piece by guest contributor Sonam Joshi for The Times Of India, where she talks about the changing dynamics of one our most beloved childhood memories- the tiffin dabba. In these times when the vegetarian versus non-vegetarian debate has taken the country by storm, what implication does it have on school children who, alien to this conundrum, unassumingly and innocently share their dabbas with their fellow classmates?

Well, remember that time when your fellow strict-vegetarian-at-home Jain classmate secretly gorged on your salami sandwich at lunchtime, unbeknownst to this parents? Let's just say that may be a thing of the past now.

For generations of school students, tiffin boxes have been a reason to bond during the lunch recess, taste unfamiliar regional and community dishes, and simply swap their boring dabba with a classmate's tastier one. This lunchbox-fuelled camaraderie even inspired Amol Gupte's 2011 film Stanley ka Dabba, where students share their tiffins with a classmate who can't afford to bring one. Yet, the humble school tiffin is increasingly at the centre of a vegetarian versus-non-vegetarian food divide, with several schools issuing rules and guidelines for what's inside lunchboxes, especially for students from junior classes.Sonam Joshi in The Times Of India

The walk, based on Humphrey House's 25-page satire 'I spy with my little eye', started from College Street Coffee House and culminated at Dalhousie Square.

The 1937 satire ridicules the 'spyarchy', which was aiding the police in Calcutta in 1930s. The civic administration had all but ceased to operate and was replaced by the colonial policing system, giving way to everyday vigilantism. The narrator of the book takes the reader through the streets of Calcutta on a heady journey and the group on Saturday followed his footsteps through non-descript lanes of College Street, Bowbazar, Phears Lane and the building that housed the famous Nanking restaurant. The two-hourlong walk gave a glimpse of how spy network operated in Calcutta and the lives of real and suspected spies who waged their own battles against an oppressive regime.

JU PhD researcher Sujaan Mukherjee, who conducted the walk, said, ""I found the pamphlet relevant even after 80 years, when the freedom of speech and press is under threat. The idea was to make the participants know of the different spynetworks as well as the colonial thought-policing in a realistic and engaging way.""

House was a member of the 'Parichay' adda and was friends with some of the most dynamic minds of that time -- Sudhindranath Datta, Buddhadev Bose, Susobhan Sarkar, Chhabi Datta, Bishnu De, Humayun Kabir and Dhurjati Prasad Mukherji. He also maintained close ties with Michael Carritt, John Auden and Rev. Michael Scott. He came to be suspected of being a communist spy and was kept under close watch.

The letters exchanged between this group of friends and him (in English and Bengali) even after House's departure from India have been carefully preserved by his daughter, Rachel Thurley. During the walk, Mukherjee showed photocopies of some of these letters, parts of which were cut off by colonial police to give an idea of censorship at that time.

Mukherjee added that House's 'India Box' was digitized by the School of Cultural Texts and Records, Jadavpur University.

""The walk unraveled Calcutta as a city of spy during the 1930s when it was no longer the capital,"" said Tathagata Neogi of HWC. He added that the British authorities had banned all communist activity during this time, and offered a brief glimpse into how the party had continued to operate.

Radio personality and heritage blogger Deepanjan Ghosh added, ""I did not really know that there was a network of spies operating in Calcutta. There was a lot of information about censorship and what the city in 1930s and 1940s was like.""

Subhabrata Ghosh, an IT professional, found the idea behind the walk innovative and ""well-researched""."

Meeting Santa for the first time can be scary, wonderful, puzzling or just plain vanilla. These personas share their first brush in with Father Christmas and what happened next.

Like most Goan Catholic families, mine also propagated the tradition of Santa Claus. It was something to be associated with joy. It was not a particular event that led me to stop believing that Santa comes and puts gifts under the tree but simply a gradual process of growing up. And really, the spirit of Santa Claus is not something I stopped believing. Saint Nicholas did exist and he did a lot for children.Still, today, Christmas is much more of a spiritual matter for me about a man being born who would spread the message of equality. It's not so much about the parties for me.

My grandparents and my dad tried to propagate the myth for awhile. And I did get drawn into it for a few years but it didn't last too long.There would be stories of Santa Claus and the comic books I read would have a story around the theme. My gifts would always be there the morning of Christmas Day under the tree.There would always be a portly teacher or priest at the catholic school that I went to who would visit each class a day before winter vacations. He would dress up as Santa and go around distributing sweets to each student.

We lived in a building called Christmas Eve in Breach Candy, Mumbai, where residents were tickled at the idea of having 'Christmas Eve' [party] at Christmas Eve. My father, [Alyque], would never fail to dress up as Santa. Aside from usual gifts, he'd give special Christmas puddings to everyone at the party. I remember one time he dressed up in a green hat, green shirt and pants, as a reminder to 'go green' for Christmas. And even though he won't be with us this Christmas, we've decided to go back to Christmas Eve for their party. To celebrate this festive season with family and dine in the company of friends. That's what he'd want.

I was told all kinds of stories about Father Christmas and that you had to be good to receive gifts. When I was five, I met this fat man dressed in red, at someone's party in Bangalore, where I lived. There were kids milling around him and they wanted to know who he was and what he was all about. Everyone's parents would push their kids to go say hi to Santa. From his big red bag he pulled out gifts for everyone. I still recall waiting to open my gift, which, when unwrapped, was a small dinky car! And so a week before Christmas we would all be on our best behaviour. Even if we didn't see him the night before, there would be gifts under the tree next morning."
"279","1024880766","2018-12-23","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nagas-race-against-time-to-record-their-fast-vanishing-folklore/articleshow/67213034.cms","Nagas race against time to record their fast-vanishing folklore - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"Without a script until the later part of the 19th century, Naga tribes attached great value to oral tradition. For generations, they passed on their history, poetry, folksongs and ancient wisdom that way. Much of this vast treasure trove of knowledge and information has already been lost because of the dying art of storytelling and the zeal of the early Christian missionaries. ""Though they introduced script to the Naga people, the early missionaries saw everything traditional as anti-Christian and prohibited it, from traditional songs to hairstyles to rice beer,"" said Tuisem Ngakang, a doctorate on Naga culture and former assistant professor with Hindu College in Delhi University.

So, camcorder in hand, 42-year-old Ngakang goes to distant Naga villages, interacts with elderly residents and requests them to sing old songs. ""Among Nagas, it is considered a duty of the elders to pass on what they know to youngsters. So, these people, mostly in their 70s and 80s, are only too happy to share,"" he said. Ngakang is on a mission -- to document and preserve whatever is left of the fast-vanishing folklore of the indigenous people.

A deep sense of urgency is visible among Naga tribes as they race against time to record whatever they can. But it's not easy, going by the vast number of local languages and dialects they have. There are about 35 Naga tribes in Nagaland, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal. D Koulie, professor of linguistics at Nagaland University, said there are 89 dialects in 89 villages of just the Angami Naga people. Koulie is also secretary of the Ura Academy which works to preserve Tenyidie -- the mother language of 10 tribes, including Angami, Chakhesang, Rengma and Zeliang.

In earlier times, when villages got congested, a member would venture out to establish another settlement. But it was taboo to set up a village without a new language. So, the same tribe would speak different languages in different villages, giving rise to numerous dialects. ""These dialects are morphologically similar but different phonologically. To preserve folklore, we ask students to visit their village homes, listen to the elderly and document stories and poetry,"" Koulie added. The Ura Academy regularly brings out journals and books documenting poetry, stories and dramas in Tenyidie. Easterine Kire, one of the foremost writers from the northeast, has collected 200 poems in Tenyidie that had been passed on orally.

Tangkhul Nagas of Manipur have embarked on a similar mission. Members of the Hao Folklore Society (HFS), formed in March this year, have visited 15 Tangkhul villages in the last five months. ""We met senior residents, recorded and archived folksongs, folktales, histories and genealogies,"" said HFS president Raising Shimri. HFS also tries to preserve traditional houses and artefacts. Members of the society include lecturers, media professionals, photographers and lawyers, and live in cities across India but return to villages to document and record the oral history of their people. Armed with sound recorders, DSLR cameras or just their cellphones, HFS members fan out looking for elderly people and requesting them to perform traditional songs and dances.

But there is a Himalayan task ahead of them -- they need to cover about 206 Tangkhul villages, each with different dialects.

Not all tribes, however, are so organised. The Konyak tribe of Mon district in Nagaland were the last to get introduced to the modern education system. Only some individuals have taken it upon themselves to preserve their folklore. Phejin Konyak has written a book on the last of the tattooed headhunters of her tribe, describing in detail the rituals involved and what the tattoo patterns mean. ""It is a solo effort,"" said Phejin.

Nzanmongi Jasmine Patton, an assistant professor at Gargi College in Delhi, too has taken the solo route. She has published a collection of 30 stories from her Lotha tribe in 'A Girl Swallowed By A Tree: Lotha Naga Tales Retold'. Though Lotha Nagas have Kyong Academy that is supposed to work towards preserving their culture, the 35-year-old writer said most effort regarding documentation is being made by Lothas individually.

As early missionaries prohibited institutions like morungs (traditional Naga youth hostels) and indigenous rituals, songs and music too disappeared soon. ""We have lost most of ritual music associated with events like rice-pounding or house-building,"" said Ngakang.

Koulie, who has written 21 books of which 18 are in Tenyidie, said, ""If you look at school curriculum, there is no material on tradition and folklore. Every Sunday we gather for sermons, but have no time for traditional stories,"" he said.

H Khehovi Yepthomi, advisor to the Nagaland government for tourism, art and culture, admitted nothing much has been done till now and Naga folklore ""is going to be extinct"" if proactive steps aren't taken. ""I have asked cultural officers to identify heritage sites and look for experts willing to document oral history."" The government has now decided to hold three-day mini Hornbill festivals in all the districts spread all though the year.

But hope comes with anxiety. Shimri said, ""Time is against us. It is disappointing when we reach a particular village to find a majority of the elderly have passed away, and along with them stories that have got buried forever."""

I am six years old. The class teacher has decided that we shall stage the Nativity scene for the annual concert, which the junior school hosts just before winter vacations begin. Every single one of us, all girls, in that 40-strong class wants desperately to be Mary. Mary is the star. We may not know what a virgin is but we all instinctively understand footage.

Eventually, the sweet-faced Shreya Bachawat is chosen to play Mary, and my tall friend Anindita Kundu, who is bold and unafraid of dialogue, is going to be Joseph. The casting is so perfect that even I cannot mutter rebelliously against it -- I may be ungainly, awkward and fiercely shy, but I am nothing if not a born director, I cannot quarrel with the protagonists. Next, I focus on the angels even though I know it's never going to happen. The angels get to wear pearly satin gowns and silver stars on their foreheads and take the shimmery wings home. My bus-friend Princy Susan Idiculla, with her thick Malayali hair, is a natural angel.

The choir is the final place to aspire to if you want your takeaway from this exercise to be nice clothes. The choristers are going to wear matching pink frocks with velvet sashes and bows in their hair. I am so excited by the outfit, it's straight out of the books I like to read. But as is the nature of such things, only those who sing well are taken into the choir. So, after a whole week of panicking wildly that I am going to be nothing at all, not even a cow in the manager, and it's going to be supremely difficult to explain this to my mother who doesn't know how awkward and quiet I am in school and who is already planning to attend the concert with my great-grandmother, I finally get cast. I am a shepherd.

I don't really know what a shepherd is. But the word sounds so exotic, so soft and dense on my tongue, like a piece of sticky toffee, that the first flush of relief I feel at having been cast at last morphs into excitement after all; a shepherd with a real lantern, that's what I am, a shepherd! Later, when I realise the shepherds must wear brown, sack-like shifts (of poplin, another beautiful, deceptive word that had sounded as fancy as satin and velvet to me but turns out to be all cottony and plain), I roll on the floor and cry. But by then, it's too late. I decide I shall act my heart out in my minor scene: when Gabriel comes, the shepherds are scared. Breaking out of my shell, in order to affect genuine fear, I end up making friends with the other shepherds. It is turning out to be a breakthrough concert for me.

I don't know if anyone spots the genuine horror on my face on the final day of the performance (or the large amounts of rouge on my cheeks) -- everyone is busy falling in love with the gentle Mary -- but the show is a hit. Afterward, just before we are yanked out of the green room by our mothers, my shepherd friends and I trade vacation plans. A few are going away on holidays; a few are looking forward to the Christmas lights on Park Street; and me? I am, of course, looking forward to the Christmas tree at home. It's, in fact, been taken out today. Tomorrow, it'll be lit.

""Don't lie,"" one of the shepherds tells me bossily, ""You're not Christians. You're not going to get a Christmas tree.""

""We might not be Christians,"" I tell them witheringly, ""But my Aunty-Nani and Uncle-Nana are. And they have a huge Christmas tree. With coloured lights and tiny Santa Clauses and reindeer-heads hanging from it. And -- "" my voice catches at my personal favourite -- ""A really cute baby Jesus in a box-manger.""

But, by now, the shepherds have transformed back into little girls in skirts and pigtails, hard as nails, utterly disbelieving of my stories. I don't care though.

Now that school is over, I can focus wholeheartedly on Christmas at home. We live in a third-floor apartment on a big noisy street, and now I can spend whole afternoons in the verandah of my room, reading Enid Blyton's, imagining what Santa Claus will get me on Christmas Eve, fantasizing about the kind of a cake my mother will bake for my father's birthday which is on Christmas Day and rushing through Mental Maths, which my mother insists I solve daily, waiting, waiting, waiting for evening to come. Evening comes all smoky-orange and cold. The moment it gets dark, I am allowed to rush up to Aunty- Nani's.

One floor up. The stairs melt away under the pounding of my feet. Christmas lights are twinkling outside the door. There's a bright green Christmas tree in the corner, under the canopy of the money plant. The hallway inside is festooned with dark-green wreaths and colourful stockings. A profusion of glittery stars and silver-golden bells and colourful candy canes have created a wonderland out of that familiar drawing room. The second-most familiar place to me in all the world after my own, Aunty-Nani's house has been suddenly made new and strange. I love the transformation.

In the days leading up to Christmas, there are always plates of rose cookies and kalkals on the table, both of which I devour in large quantities, preferring them to the plummy, rum-infused slabs of Christmas cake.

On Christmas Day, there's an open house at Aunty-Nani's and millions of people come and go -- their relatives and friends, my parents and grandparents, our other relatives who have come over to wish my father a happy birthday. And, of course, my uncle and his friends who are also friends with Aunty-Nani and Uncle-Nana's four grown-up children. It's a gigantic party. While technically, we eat my father's birthday lunch at home, downstairs, a certain amount of cross-pollination happens in the food department too. Aunty-Nani always makes biryani or a zarda pulao for Christmas lunch.

As the day progresses, the grown-ups drink copious quantities of the wine that Uncle Nana has brewed through the year and talk loudly, sometimes singing and shouting and laughing wildly. But I, blending into the corner, allowing the sounds and stories to seep into me, care only for the rose cookies and the kalkals and the atmosphere of magic where the house, our familiar beloved old building, has become a place where anything seems possible as long as the twinkly lights are up.

One of the many slices of Calcutta's composite culture -- that includes, in addition to the cultures of East Bengal and West Bengal and Bihar and Orissa, discrete Parsi, Jewish and Armenian components -- is the Anglo-Indian one. And so, it is only as an adult, that I realise the true bounties of my own Calcutta Christmases in that fourth-floor walk-up in Calcutta where Mr and Mrs Ireland lived for so many years. Later, when I wrote my second novel, which had an Anglo-Indian protagonist, a lot of what I had unconsciously inhaled magically transmuted itself into fiction.

When my parents moved into that house in the early Eighties, the Irelands quickly became their kin in the city, their first port of call, ""Aunty"" and ""Uncle"". When I was born, they were promoted to the dubious double-barrelled distinction: Aunty-Nani and Uncle-Nana. At the time, all four of their children were still at home. And, while Brenda and Cheryl became my mashis, and Ivan, the youngest, the one full of jokes and crazy stories, became mama (clearly my mother was claiming most of the family), Henry, who was called Raju at home, was the lone renegade on my father's side. He insisted on being my chacha.

Over the years, the mashis got married and moved away, and Raju chacha and his wife went to the Middle East. Eventually, Ivan mama, too, got married and before they moved out, I remember that every single evening, for a whole year, his young bride Amrita and I played Uno on the roof.

When my grandparents moved to Calcutta permanently and began to live with us, it quickly became apparent that my refined Calcutta-bred grandmother and the refined Lucknow-bred Aunty-Nani would embark on an unforgettable friendship, forged over the paan-daan. Every evening, they would convene on the roof, for chai and conversation, and, as evening fell, they would delicately take their conversation indoors, in front of the television set where Neena Gupta was single-handedly revolutionising TV, with shows like Saans and Dard.

The pleasant Calcutta springs waxed into insufferable summers and, then, slowly turned into autumns and winters of discontent. There were crises, minor and major, and through it all -- accidents, exams, broken engagements and illnesses -- the exchange of food and news between the two floors continued unabated. I grew up. We moved away to a different house. I left Calcutta after college.

It was only years later, after the high drama of college and early youth subsided, one Christmas eve far away in Paris, when the lights and crowds of Champs-Élysées had fatigued me incessantly and worry about my dying grandmother was wound like a skein through my bones, that I woke up in the middle of the night, hungry for Aunty-Nani's rose cookies.

Uncle-Nana's Home-brewed Wine

Ingredients

2.5 kg black grapes, ripe

1.5 kg sugar

8-10 limes

50g fresh yeast

Method

You are going to need a large steel container to brew the wine, and large glass jars to store it during the fermentation. You will also need glass bottles to store the wine after it's ready and wooden spoons to stir the concoction. Everything has to be sterilised first.

Wash the grapes thoroughly and then let them dry off. Make grape juice. Remember, the seeds should not get blended into the juice but stay whole in the pulp. Otherwise, the wine might be bitter. Next, measure the volume of grape juice. Take an equal amount of warm purified water and dissolve the sugar in it. In another container, take lukewarm water, add 2-3 spoons of sugar and the fresh yeast. Add the juice of 2-3 limes. Cover and let it rise.

In the large steel container, add the grape juice and pulp, the sweetened water, the yeast which has now risen fully, and the juice of the remaining limes. Mix well with a wooden spoon. Now, tightly cover the container with a clean cotton cloth. As it ferments, bubbles will rise and a peculiar scent is going to emanate from it. Do not be deterred.

Advertising

Over the next four or five days, the concoction in the steel container has to be stirred twice every day with a wooden spoon. When the fermentation is complete, the concoction is now divided up into sterilised glass jars, leaving empty space above. Seal the glass jars tightly. They now have to be kept in a cool dark place for a few months, and, ideally, left completely undisturbed. After a period of at least six months, you can decant the wine into glass bottles, leaving the pulp sediment at the bottom of the jar.

Tweaking the cake and yakhni pulao are some.

You can never return,"" says Ruth Chakravarty, as she assorts the samagri (ingredients) of her Christmas cake -- orange peels, cherries, petha (candied ash gourd), candied ginger -- into small bags. The washed raisins are set to dry in a steel pan before they can make their way into a bag.

""This is how we used to do it back in Akbarpur Chitauri,"" says Chakravarty, of the Christmas preparation in her ancestral village in Sambhal, western Uttar Pradesh. The Christmas cake is ""always a family recipe, passed down generations,"" she says.

At her home in Sarojini Nagar, Lucknow, Chakravarty, 63, attempts to recreate Akbarpur Chitauri. Her living room has a vintage brass paan-daan, a nickel roti-daan to store bread, golden brass plates, rusted table tops and a silver table lamp. Chakravarty brought the artefacts, over 100 years old, from her ancestral home which was ""completely dilapidated and was sold in 1986"". A painting in her living room provides a glimpse of its past glory -- a grand white building with Hellenic pillars and a garden in the front.

""Christmas was a big affair at home and preparations would begin in the first week of December,"" she says with nostalgic enthusiasm. The family had a fleet of domestic helps who would be sent to buy and chop the ingredients for the cake -- the ""most complicated dish"" of the festival. The women of the house would prepare the ""pakwaans"", which included gujiya, namakpaare, shakkarpaare, bajre ki tikki, mathri and khajoor. A day before the festival, the children of the large joint family would get together to rehearse their lines for a Christmas-themed play. ""My aunt wrote the play and the lines were in Hindi."" As there was no electricity, the play would be conducted under lanterns, and other children of the village would gather to watch it. Each child would be served a helping of chai, pakwaans and cake. There was no typical Christmas pine tree with all its colourful paraphernalia. ""We would decorate the two big Raat ki rani trees in our garden with paper buntings and silver wraps of chocolates. That was our Christmas tree,"" she says.

Chakravarty, the first in her family to study in English medium, moved to Lucknow in 1971 to enrol at the prestigious Loreto Convent school. Over the next 47 years, she would make the city her home, completing a PhD in English literature from Lucknow University and teaching at the iconic Isabella Thoburn College for 37 years before retiring last year.

As her son works in Gurugram, Chakravarty lives alone in her sprawling home, with seven dogs for company. On Christmas, she will drape the pets with woollen coats, that are being stitched at a tailor's shop. For now, she sits with her domestic help to prepare and assort the ingredients for the cake. A day before the festival, they would place the ingredients inside a box and take it to a bakery. There, they will be mixed, placed in moulds and baked in a clay oven. Unlike most Christmas cakes, Chakravarty's family recipe does not include liquor.

As with the Christians of Uttar Pradesh, the majority of them converts from Hinduism, the Christmas pakwaans at Chakravarty's home consist of gujiyas, namakpaaras and shakkarpaaras.

Christmas in Lucknow, though, she says, is ""much simpler than it was in the village."" ""Here, people just buy the pakwaans from the market. I do that, too,"" she says.

""You can never return,"" she repeats.

In Lucknow, she now cooks the biryani instead of the yakhni pulao of her village. ""In the Aligarh (western) side of UP, yakhni pulao is the centrepiece of the Christmas meal. In Lucknow, it's always the biryani,"" she says. Her festive menu also includes qorma and shami kebabs. Mutton, not chicken, is the meat of the day. ""You see, I have been completely Lucknowised,"" she says in crisp Hindustani.

There is no typical pine tree at her home. Her entire garden is lit with small lights and colourful lanterns on the big day -- reminiscent of the Raat ki rani at Akbarpur Chitauri. Her home inside will be done up with rajnigandha, gladioli and roses -- the way her ""village home would be"".

For Chakravarty, Christmas celebrations are ""muted"", never flashy, with ""emphasis on its spiritual value"". For example, a large part of the Christmas cake is distributed among the underprivileged who can't celebrate the festival. For one week after Christmas, friends and families -- Chakravarty's extended family also moved to Lucknow -- meet each other and share gifts. ""Giving alms to the poor, and bonding with family and friends are an important element of the festival. Christmas is an occasion of giving love, of spreading harmony and peace, the reason why Jesus Christ was sent to this world,"" she says."

Mrs Maisel is Everywoman -- angry and sad, inspired and hopeful, vulnerable and buoyant, at the same time.

Somewhere in the past few years, at least in India, women found self-love. Brené Brown became a role model, vulnerability became an asset, and 'I am enough' a badge to be worn. In the Instagram avalanche of personal stories, embracing our imperfections and owning our bodies became a trend.

But nothing truly prepared us for The Marvelous Mrs Maisel, currently in its second season on Amazon Prime. On the face of it, Mrs Maisel (aka Midge or Miriam) is a privileged Upper West Side (New York) woman with a marriage and two children, a manicured home and a talent for baking (she trades briskets to gain spots at a café for her husband's unoriginal stand-up acts). When Midge's husband decides to leave her for his secretary one night, her carefully curated life becomes a house of cards; she responds by venting in a drunken stupor in front of an audience at the same café and discovers something about herself: her flair for stand-up comedy.

Mrs Maisel is a lot. She's endearing, witty, attractive, poised, well-dressed, the life of the party. She is the loud one, the funny one, the ballsy one, the weird one -- and she lets all of them thrive. Midge has the goods to survive in a world of patriarchy, but there is no feminism in her universe, even though she occasionally stumbles into rallies and says things like, ""Women will fix it. And accessorize it!""

Yes, she is a ""fix it"" bomb, much as my mother and I are; much as we all are.

Advertising

She wears her sexuality lightly, her motherhood even lighter. When she talks about pregnancy -- ""allowing another human to grow inside you till it reaches 6-12 pounds and then giving it an escape route the size of a change purse"" -- you chuckle. When she wonders if she was meant to be a mother and maybe she picked the wrong profession, you lean forward. But Midge's journey of finding her voice is far more layered than the predictable evolution from housewife to career woman.

As someone who struggled balancing motherhood with a writing career (and still does), I was reminded that even with all the strollers, baby-wearing gear, and tactile toys -- birthing and caring for children inevitably presents a roadblock to nurturing of the self. Those ""having it all"" essay writers probably haven't struggled with stifling creative freedom.

Midge is progressive in the way she turns her marital mishaps into material, without pointing fingers. I may not have her waist, or share her fetish for hats but I could see scenes from my life playing out as comedy (even the sad ones). Everything is material.

But I wasn't perplexed that a show about a woman who is a mother does not focus on her motherhood. Her children are like byproducts -- incidental, almost invisible, inaudible even. Yes, she has parents in the same building (and later, in the same house when she moves in with them); yes, she often leaves her children with them; yes, they were far less hands-on than she was; and yes, it was the maid who really looked after the children -- I didn't process the logistics. Except that time when, midway through wheeling her child in the park, she starts addressing a rally and I wondered where the baby was. I still loved her, and was in no mood to analyse her motherhood skills, which I would have done in my early years of motherhood, still hungover from prostaglandins. Perhaps she doesn't overthink motherhood, although once, while on a tour, she calls home to speak to her mother, and wonders if ""the baby"" has forgotten her. She talks to mothers who rejoice when their children go to school as opposed to the perpetually joyful mothers. That her children seem to deliberately fade into the background is exactly why The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel worked for me. Maybe it shouldn't have.

Money is never a problem for her in spite of a day-job as a sales-counter girl or cloak girl at a departmental store, having been demoted to working the phones. As a single mother with no child support, this should have jarred or made me angry -- how unequal our lives were, despite having something in common. But it didn't.

Mrs Maisel is Everywoman -- angry and sad, inspired and hopeful, vulnerable and buoyant, at the same time. The show isn't applauding Midge's bravado for the choices she makes. It works because it treats her motherhood and stand-up career as mutually exclusive events. I can't believe that a show set in the 1950s is so relatable: perhaps the universally internalised notion of a joyful motherhood is at loggerheads with the desire to pursue joys of a different sort. We can't pretend that deriving joy from our children doesn't come at the expense of our own professional/ creative journeys. Amid all the cacophony of voices we nurture, sometimes, we can still hear our own. And that's just fine."

Also, do you think readers are slowly shunning physical copies and preferring e-books? Wait, the Hyderabad Book Fair will prove you wrong. From commoners to connoisseurs, the book lovers are thronging the book fair venue which is witnessing an increasing footfall day-by-day.

Almost all of the visitors to whom we spoke share that the touch and feel of the physical copy can't be replaced by an e-version of the same. ""Visual media is just to watch and enjoy but reading books will improve your thinking and thereby imaginative power,"" says Shantha Rao, a theatre activist. He adds that reading a physical copy will lead to hand, head, and heart correlation, which is very important to make an informed decision.

Phani Palavajala, a youngster who was at the fair to buy biographies, expresses a similar opinion when he says that while reading a hard copy, there will be no deviation, unlike an e-book. He adds that catching hold of a book gives immense pleasure. A tenth standard student, M Srija Sree shares that the experience of reading a book is unmatched and they were encouraged by their school management to read books.

Sheik Sadiq Ali, who is an organiser of a stall named Thopudu Bandi, says that it is not true that the reading habit is vanishing. ""Old and young generations, especially school children, love physical books, only those in between seem to prefer digital copies. And, reading a physical copy is more eye-friendly than going for a digital one,"" he shares.

Ali adds that some of the schools are encouraging their students to read and, thus, inculcating the habit of reading among children. ""I have seen a student purchasing books worth Rs 3,500 saying there are no better friends than books,"" he says.

A film actor and writer Paruchuri Venkateshwara Rao observes that visual media is momentary but reading is not. He says, ""Once you develop a habit of reading, it will stay forever."" The veteran actor also feels that the youngsters are fed up with the repetitive visual content and books are providing them with something fresh and new.

Eshwar Kavali, a civil services aspirant who is a regular visitor of the annual Hyderabad Book Fair, says that hard copies have a tangible feeling of touch and smell which will be missing in e-books. E-copies can supplement one's reading experience at the most, but not completely substitute. Eshwar also notes that the place has become an intellectual hangout where one can interact with fellow book lovers and students can also go beyond regular textbooks.

There is much more happening at the fair which is also a platform to develop and improve reading habit, mainly for the children with events such as story-reading, story-writing, one-minute Telugu, etc. ""Exercises such as these will help in building curiosity among children and also in reinterpreting what they read,"" says Shantha Rao who is also the person in-charge of 'Bala Vikas' which is looking after these exercises.

At the 32nd edition of the Hyderabad Book Fair, which is on till December 25 at NTR Stadium in Hyderabad, the organisers are expecting a footfall of around 10 lakhs. With 10-day exclusive events being organised for school children, the team behind the fair is eyeing at 2-3 lakh more visitors this time.

The organisers of the annual book fair are confident that the reading habit has not totally gone and this book fair will prove those who think so wrong. ""Holding a book and reading it are like going back to the mother's lap. Whatever we do and wherever we go, we will finally reach our mother,"" says Rajeshwar Rao, the treasurer of Hyderabad Book Fair.

""As there are more events for school children, we are expecting more numbers with children and their parents visiting the book fair,"" he shares.

""There was a complaint during the last edition that there were fewer books of other languages; we rectified it this year by sending our representatives to other book fairs and bringing other language publishers to the fair,"" says Rajeshwar, adding that the stall owners are very happy with the response they have been receiving."

With the conclusion of Jammu Municipal Elections after thirteen years came the hope for accountability, solutions for public grievances - hope for a change. Corporators arranged thanks giving lunch/dinner and subsequently visited their wards with respective MLAs, who still had the CDF (Constituency Development Funds) as the assembly was still active and public got much needed confidence booster, once again promises of clean Jammu were given and public started believing the Corporators of their wards. Each and every Corporator's Facebook wall is full of pictures, either of felicitations or of drain cleaning which earlier MLAs were flaunting on social media. Along with all these activities background canvassing for Mayor and Deputy Mayor were also going on.

Despite BJP having clear majority in JMC, election of Mayor seemed to be a tough but ultimately Jammu got its Mayor and Deputy Mayor on 15th November 2018 after many deliberations. With this also the process of photo sessions, felicitation ceremonies commenced and in between Governor dissolved J & K assembly on 21st November and suddenly all MLAs disappeared from scene in shock mode, Mayor and Deputy Mayor became the ultimate VIPs to be invited for inaugurations which they lapped up happily as if posts of Mayor and Deputy Mayor were carved out for this purpose only. After nearly one month of their elections first general body meeting of JMC was convened and whatever expectations or dreams public were having got shattered with a bang. If one goes through the agenda of the meeting, 'Seva Bhav' for public disappeared and top priority with unanimity is to increase honorarium of Corporators to at least forty to fifty thousand despite the example laid by PM Modi who had donated 21 lakhs rupee, his personal savings as Chief Minister's salary in 10 years, for educating daughters of drivers and peons working with Gujarat Government. In today's contest it is to think about your interests rest all is secondary.

Eleven items were listed in agenda and it included demand for opening of school for Children of Municipal employees as if there is no government school in entire Jammu , recruitment of Safai Karam Charis - what about the existing ones who work for few hours in the morning and then disappear for their private assignments, promotion orders of employees - for their outstanding efforts to make Jammu a City of garbage and chaos , beautification of JMC walls - as if it is the only place in whole Jammu, no parking zone in JMC premises- to further congest adjoining roads , plantation in and around JMC - to provide better air to corporators, outsourcing of autos for garbage collection, night sanitation and animal birth control programme- to claim no responsibility of theirs in future. Jammuites are shocked and amazed to see no agenda for Jammu public as if all these corporators have been elected for their own cause, for the building of JMC or employees there in. It's not long ago when State High Court had to intervene when a RTI revealed that Rs. 34,65,374 were spent to convert a cattle pond to Municipal Quarter No.10 at Gandhi Nagar which was later allotted to Joint Commissioner (A) who was nearing his superannuation, a gift was given to the former officer at the cost of the rights of the animals.

Similarly a PIL seeking high level probe into the illegal/backdoor allotments of Municipal Quarters/ Flats/ Shops in favour of ex-employees of JMC /private persons and sought investigation by State Vigilance Organization as JMC further extended lease of their accommodations for 40 years at a meager rent of Rs.600 to Rs.900 per month for prime municipal flats situated at Gandhi Nagar, Jammu and beneficiaries included former Commissioner/ Secretary to Government of J&K Housing and Urban Development Department who at one time was JMC Commissioner as well, former Joint Commissioner (Adm) JMC, ex-PA to Commissioner JMC, Driver of JMC, PSO to Commissioner/ Secretary to Govt. of J&K H&UDD to name a few and ultimately the Division Bench ordered for the entire record of more than 600 allotments of JMC assets made in the similar fashion without adopting any procedure/ criteria. Past and present actions are in sync depicting only self use of JMC resources with impunity.

Contrary to JMC, right now SMC (Srinagar Municipal Corporation) is working day and night with Mayor Junaid Azim Mattu leading from front as any feedback on his twitter handle is treated as complaint and corrective measures are taken immediately. Srinagar public is actively participating and enjoying the proactive approach of their Mayor. No day has gone since taking oath when Mayor and Deputy Mayor have not visited different problematic areas and on spot decisions have been taken. All reharis have been asked to register so that some alternative arrangements are made to accommodate them in a phased manner but in Jammu Mayor has ordered restoration of illegal Kiosks in front of GMC to be restored at unused matador stand despite traffic bottle neck in the area. Another worth mention decision by SMC is collection of waste from butcheries so that the it is properly dumped at the authorized site but no such initiative at Jammu. Sunday bazaar market of Lal Chowk has been regularized with nominal fee, all encroachments are getting removed in a phased manner including bunkers , traffic police kiosks on footpath, suggestions / plans are being made for beautification, requisition for funds for water bodies preservation are few other measures. Though identical is the situation at Jammu's Sunday market right from Bus stand, Shalamar, City Chowk, Super bazaar, Purani Mandi, Raj Tilak road to Parade but no such stream lining or revenue generation initiative. SMC Mayor is regularly arranging meetings of different departments for better co-ordination for quick and better results but it requires a herculean effort to get one's street light repaired at Jammu. All talks little action is the buzz word at Jammu.

Coming back to JMC, only way to lodge complaint is through their web site and believe it requires hell lot of effort to get registered your complaint and the mobile number of contact person you receive by return SMS is either non -existent or the concerned person is not responsible for the concerned ward. Countless Commissioners have been replaced in a span of last three years without any result so much so that Smart City project is standing at same place from where it started but who bothers. There is no Solid Waste Disposal site/policy in place despite number of reminders from High Court, no STP in place as such whole sewage waste is being dumped in river Tawi from where drinking water is supplied to whole old city, no fogging during monsoon to check dengue. Plastic carry bags are sold openly in the market, from where they are procured and how they reach market is not priority of JMC reasons better known to them only. No scheme in place for door to door household garbage collection and no campaign in media for public awareness. There is no transparency in dog sterilization program as these services are shuttling between NGOs and Municipality and both blaming each other for the failure to curtail dog menace in almost every ward. No biometric attendance of employees in place with the result even newly elected corporators are running pillar to post to get allocated nonexistent Safai workers of their respective wards. Leaking water pipes of drinking water in drains are there in every ward as there is no mechanism in place for coordination between JMC and PHE, civil wing of JMC unable to get repaired the damaged lanes as there is no accountability, illegal infrastructures coming up despite army of 17 exclusive employees in Enforcement wing of JMC to look after 75 wards. High Court has to intervene time and again to rap JMC for repeated deficiency of services but that too is of little use and all these glaring lapses are testimony to failure of parental department which was with BJP for last 3 years.

Earlier MLAs were performing the duties of Corporators, looking after lanes, drains of the area but their half hearted efforts were more intended for photo sessions as such it had yielded only shoddy work which disappeared with the first monsoon shower of the season as there is no check on quality of work as no supervising engineer is there on site to see whether drains have proper slope or lanes have been laid as per set parameters or the resultant malba lifted. There is urgent need of streamlining the system with latest techniques along with innovative ideas to get the things done in proper manner. Installing vending machines for plastic bottles at all public places, converting flowers collected from temples to incense sticks, rain water harvesting in new buildings are few innovations which all modern cities are adopting. Mayor or concerned staff of JMC should visit Indore, the cleanest city of India, for practical ideas how they achieved this as with the elections approaching fast and BJP running the JMC now it's their last chance to set things right which their ministers and MLAs had failed in the past and with their own Government at Centre and President's rule in state they don't have any excuse this time right now. One hopes JMC takes corrective measures to put a system in place instead of random knee jerk measures which are of no use. Planning and implementation are the most important aspects without which JMC is bound to fail once again this time as well as in the past. Right now the question of public is, will they deliver this time?

When the trailer for Shah Rukh Khan's Zero dropped, the reason for the title wasn't obvious, but it reveals itself swiftly if you watch the film. Zero is the number of people involved in the film who were sober during the making of Khan's latest release.

This is the only explanation for the ridiculous plot and once you know what you're looking for, it's clear that love of intoxicating beverages plays a significant part in Zero's story. How do Bauua (Khan) and his lady love Aafiya (Anushka Sharma) bond? By getting drunk. What does Babita (Kaif) wave around in the air when we see her making a public appearance as a Bollywood superstar? A bottle that looks suspiciously like it has a grey goose on it. The fictitious international space research centre in Zero? It sounds like a slurring drunkard trying to spell NASA (""NSAR"").

The best part about getting drunk is that it makes every thought feel like a brainwave. So yes, while floating in an intoxicated haze, it might be funny to imagine a gang of mean dwarves (played by kids) who lurk in New York's alleys, looking to beat up other vertically-challenged persons. It may also seem logical that a school kid would mistake a 38-year-old person with dwarfism to be a fellow student, just because they're both roughly the same height. Similarly, it may seem like a good idea to have the cerebral palsy-afflicted heroine (Aafiya) writhe on the ground in one of her first scenes, trying to pick up a pen that was deliberately dropped on the floor to humiliate her and draw attention to her physical disability. Just like the decision to include a neurotic chimpanzee and a new-born baby in her re-introduction scene may seem like a genius when one is seeing double. Under the influence, you are forgiven for thinking candidates for space missions line up like those auditioning for So You Think You Can Dance and that the selection process to decide who will go to Mars is like a game show.

However, at some point, you should snap out of it and drink some coffee instead. When you don't, you get a film like Zero. And this is particularly unforgivable when you keep in mind that the ground floor of the Khar building that houses Khan's Red Chillies Entertainment is a gigantic coffee shop.

According to reports, Zero has had a record opening in Bihar, which suggests something about an overconfident, Brahmin man-child who isn't held back by his small-town background and lack of education resonates with audiences there. The film wants us to be impressed by Bauua's swagger and the fact that he doesn't let reality intimidate him (why we are constantly reminded of his caste with shots of his janeu, however, remains a mystery). Bauua has no doubt he's more than Aafiya's equal, even though he barely finished school and she's a celebrated scientist. He confidently takes a stab at playing footsy with Babita, undaunted by the fact that she's a beautiful celebrity while he's a nobody with limited physical charms and dependent on her charity. Throughout the film, Bauua lives off others because he is at a physiological and financial disadvantage. Yet his sense of entitlement swells like a perfectly-risen soufflé.

Babua is wish-fulfilment for all those who live in hope that male privilege will help them sail through life. His failures are forgiven, his wastefulness is tolerated and his insensitivity is adored. Meanwhile, the two heroines are plagued with self-doubt despite their many accomplishments, which is frustrating but remarkably realistic. In Aafiya's case, she does all the work and a man gets the glory, which is also very much the norm for women in science and technology. Clearly, the one detail that is immune to the happy haze of illogic in which Zero was written, is the power dynamic between men and women.

On the plus side, the film has given us Kaif's Babita, a fantastic heroine who battles addiction grapples with having her heart broken by a playboy superstar, takes a dwarf under her wing, and comes out at the other end stronger than ever. Just imagine what a delicious takedown of Bollywood we'd see if Babita got her own film."

Christmas sans the classic, beloved greeter","easternmirrornagaland.com",FALSE,"Greeting cards, left. stacked on a rack at a novelty store in Dimapur. The once beloved tradition of sending cards seems to be fading.

Eastern Mirror Desk

Dimapur, Dec. 22: Greeting cards are becoming -- or, already become? -- a thing of the past. There was a time when stores and roads in Dimapur town were decked in Christmas cards for sale even from November. All that now seems to have become a memory only people from the older generations remember. And there were times when Christmas cards that were received from loved ones were hung in a thread in almost every home -- or stored away lovingly, which also has perhaps become a thing of the past.

'It's been five years since we last received customers looking for Christmas cards... whatever is up on the rack are more than a year old while some packets are still lying unopened since the day we put it up on the rack,' said an entrepreneur Sachin Jain to Eastern Mirror. Jain runs a gift shop ""Cards Shop,"" located at the Arcade building along NL Road in Dimapur. Jain has been running the shop for almost 20 years.

The tradition of sending real cards is slowly dying out with the younger generation having appeared to be drowning in internet and mobile technology including those who have gone through the phase of exchanging greeting cards. But the warmth that Christmas cards bring is special because it's sometimes hard to express one's true feelings in person but one that can be done in writing.

Jain said, ""Since the advent of mobile phones, the sale of cards has declined. There were times when even a 'safe journey' wishes cards was selling but now the only card that sells-to some degree are birthday cards from the school students.""

Jain said that this year he received some customers looking for Christmas cards, which was expected for him as a shop owner. ""Since I do not receive any customers looking for cards for several years our shop did not bother to procure cards from the wholesaler, which is usually procured from Delhi or Guwahati. Even the wholesaler markets have limited cards because of the loss,"" he said.

However, Jain said, although the social media has taken over the old way of sending love or greetings, ""Cards Shop"" continues to take the risk of keeping cards on their rack with a hope that people would come looking for one.

Another gift shop retailer pointed out that he had removed the cards in his shop rack as there were no buyers and the cards were all lying covered in dust while some had even worn out. There are only about two-three retailers in the city that still has cards.

Where's the love?

""All I want for Christmas is to be able to send and receive a simple card that shows warmth and love. Since the advent of mobile phones and social media, I have not received any greetings through cards. Receiving cards make it special, whatever the occasion may be,"" said Dr. Rushulo Khing of Eden Medical Centre in Dimapur.

Likewise, photographer Mireuyi Herie talked about how wishes or greetings are incomplete without cards those days. He says 'hundreds of SMS is equal to one printed Christmas card,' he explained and remarked: ""Without wedding cards only family members will attend the wedding so why don't we keep and practise the age old tradition of greetings through cards as electronic conveniences have long taken over the warm greetings through card.""

Again, local singing hero Alobo Naga has a word: ""I still love the classic hand written greeting cards, and I value it but unfortunately with the advancement of digital age, it is dying in the recent years. Personally, I find it more genuine when I receive greeting cards rather than digital greetings. It is the effort that counts.""

Another person who has experienced the ""old"" custom of exchanging greeting cards is Ninoto Zhimomi. He said: ""Ever since electronics and technology took hold of our human life there is a decrease of emotions and feelings. Long back we visit homes of our near and dear ones giving cards and cakes but the trend is long lost. There were emotions and attachments with the sharing of cards with respect to the person. People nowadays are totally dependent on the technology which is good for the bad and bad for good.""

The practice of sending Christmas cards is declining. The myriad social media has an effect on the practice. While the internet offers more convenience, there is nothing more original and touching than receiving or sending a personal Christmas card, which is still cherished by many. The tradition of greetings cards is one of the most expressive mediums of conveying messages, many people agree."

BJP can never win any election if it doesn't take into account social dynamics of the nation. The party is taking appropriate measures and will increase its strength in May next year.

He was in Hyderabad to address the alumni and students of Indian School of Business (ISB) on ""A nation's journey through to the next era of governance"" during Solstice 2018, the annual alumni meet of the school.

""BJP will retain power in 2019 elections as the party has populist support. And there is a very widespread desire in the country that the Ram temple be built and we will build it. I have submitted a proposal to the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha. Amit Shah has also taken up the proposal and said he will check with his lawyers,"" he added.

Swamy mentioned that during the PV Narasimha Rao's government, Rao told the Supreme Court in 1994, in an affidavit as a part of the judgement, when asked what is the solution for the Ram temple, that if it ever it becomes known scientifically that there was a pre-existence temple, then the Government of India will give the land to Hindus to build the temple. The Supreme Court ordered Allahabad High Court to find out if there was any pre-existence of the temple. So the High Court has referred to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), and the ASI appointed two archaeologists who gave a unanimous report after using satellite imaging and lasers that there is a large Viashnav temple below that exists where Babri Masjid once stood.

""Rao's assurance is applicable to the current government too. We have taken the land and are building the temple now,"" he added.

On the opposition, he said, Rahul Gandhi cannot become a Prime Minister as he is the citizen of Britain. And Indian citizenship itself will be cancelled. He wouldn't even be a Member of Parliament.

Judiciary & gender equality

Uniform Civil Court though in the constitution has not been implemented. Law is a modern weapon for people, which is not used enough.

""I have my complaints on the lack of moral value among the lawyers. Also they take up so many cases that have led to delay in judgments. In the US, a court handles about 200 cases in a year while an Indian lawyer handles 200 cases individually in a year,"" he added. He said, women empowerment should happen in the country but reservation in the labour force is not necessary.

Pakistan

He said Pakistan which has been a failed nation should be divided into four parts and India should back it. The Baloch from Balochistan are keen to split out."

In its prime years, the theatre was one of the first modern halls in the city, often showcasing the latest English movies. It was quite the hangout spot for students, who bunked classes, young lovers on dates, families, friends and many more. Celebs and socialites, to whom the theatre has been an integral part of their life in Bengaluru, recount their fond memories and bid farewell to the iconic cinema hall. Excerpts:

It is sad that Rex will be no more: Pankaj Advani, cue sports champ

Before the advent of multiplexes in Bengaluru, single-screen halls like Plaza, Rex and Galaxy were our go-to places for latest film releases. As a kid, I watched many films at Rex. For us, a fun day in the city included eating out and watching a movie. It is sad that Rex will be no more, but we have to understand the market dynamics that force owners to move with the times and upgrade cinema halls.

Rex was almost like a heritage building: Madhu Nataraj, danseuse

For me, there are a lot of rapidly altering old memories and standalone landscapes that are changing. Rex was one such iconic figure. I moved to Bengaluru as a college student, and a large part of my college life was bunking classes and going and watch movies at Rex. It was the one place, apart from all the multiplexes, that one could go to. Although I haven't been to the theatre in a few years, it felt like a heritage building to me. One must also keep in mind that it was owned by a family and they had some pressure, too. A majority of Bengalureans must be feeling disappointed with the news of it shutting.

I'll miss the idea of Rex on Brigade Road: Paul Fernandes, artist

The news of Rex shutting down didn't really sadden me. But I'll miss the idea of the theatre once Rex shuts down. It is one the last old English theatres to shut down. Rex used to play only English films back in the day. I remember there would be a counter full of food items to eat during the interval. We would take great care to not buy balcony tickets, as there were huge pillars there, and if you got a seat behind the pillars, you wouldn't be able to see the screen. I remember on holidays, we would cycle down to MG Road and watch at least three movies a day. So, we would go to Galaxy Theatre for the afternoon show, then go to Rex for the next show, and finally to Plaza for the night show.

A man used to serenade those who waited for tickets: Arundhati Raja, theatreperson

When I first came to the city, Plaza Theatre had been around for a while, and Rex was, in fact, the new theatre in town. It had a new look to it. My husband, Jagdish, and I were recently recounting our memories of the theatre. One particular memory stands out for me. Given that those were the days when there was no online booking of tickets, people would queue up at the theatre to buy tickets. There used to be an old Anglo-Indian man who would stand there and sing for those standing in the queue, and make some money. Rex was just a great place to be around.

Watching the last show would be an ideal goodbye: Aravinnd Iyer, actor

My college mates, school buddies and I often skipped classes to head to Rex. We watched quite a few movies there. Once, I remember, we went to watch a Steven Spielberg film, expecting it to be a comedy, but it turned out to be dramatic, and we all walked out perplexed. Anyone who grew up in Bengaluru has a fondness for Rex. I hope they retain the old buildings and restore it, if possible. Watching the last show of the last movie to be screened at the theatre would be an ideal way to say goodbye.

It was a landmark and a place of refuge: Rubi Chakravarti, performing artiste

Rex was a place of refuge. It was also the go-to place for a lot of girls from Mount Carmel College then, and some of our professors, too. Walking down Brigade Road and heading to Rex was an experience in itself. And it was where I would meet my then boyfriend and now husband. The city was quite nuclear in the sense that everyone knew everyone and there was always a relative that we might bump into. The fact that Rex is going away makes me sad. Every Bengalurean has fond memories of the theatre -- the packeted popcorn, the homemade cutlets and the ticket-seller. But I guess the old has to give way to the new and that the next generation can make new memories in the multiplex/mall that is to replace the theatre.

It's sad that it's shutting down, but it's inevitable: KM Chaitanya, filmmaker

I have wonderful memories of Rex. My family and I -- all six of us -- used to go to Rex regularly to watch movies. What was fascinating is that there used to be a beggar outside the theatre who used to beg in English. Those of us from South Bengaluru used to see the Cantonment area as that of English-speaking folk, and even beggars spoke English there! I remember that even after I got married, my wife, I and my grandfather went to Rex to watch Taal. It's sad that the theatre is shutting down, but it's inevitable. It's like when you go back to your college -- you want everything to be as it was when you left, but that's not possible. Modern economics has made single screens impossible to manage.

We would strike up friendships with people from other colleges: Srujan Lokesh, actor-TV host

When I was in college, Brigade Road was one of our a favourite hangouts to chill out at and watch movies. We would hang out at Wimpy's (a burger joint), which also shut down many years ago, and then head to see the latest English blockbuster at Rex. The good thing about watching movies at Rex was that we would meet youngsters from other colleges also regularly and strike up friendships.

The routine was to snack at eateries nearby and then head for a film: Akul Balaji, actor-TV host

Cliffhanger was the first film I saw at Rex when I came to Bengaluru. Back then, MG Road and Brigade Road were the must-visit places for visitors to the city, and Rex was popular, since it played almost all the new English films. I used to be super impressed with the audio and video quality at the movie hall. The routine for most of us was to have a quick snack from eateries nearby and then head to watch a film at Rex. It is sad that it being replaced,but the promoters must have their reasons to shut it down."

He launched a scathing at Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu by recalling the latter's days of deception when he deception when he backstabbed his father-in-law, late CM NTR, soon after the TDP founder was elected to the Assembly from Tekkali in 1994.

YS Jagan said the local minister Atchannaidu was a complete failure in addressing public issues in the last four years. ""The TDP minister, it is said, is the big boss of the sand mafia in Amudala Valasa, Narasapuram and other places in the region. All government contracts are awarded only to the minister's brother Hari Prasad,"" he said parroting the locals' woes.

All the rivers in the region have been exploited in the name of Neeru-Chettu program while the TDP leaders demand commissions for building toilets, providing pensions and Anganwadi jobs.

The Leader of Opposition said 1,500 people in this constituency had to approach the Courts to get their pensions after the TDP leaders deliberately removed their names. The locals said Atchannaidu encroached government lands to build godowns.

Any one who wants to get a new granite quarrying license and NOC should pay Rs 25 lakhs to the associates of Atchannaidu. A land belonging to the RTC in Tekkali has been registered in the name of Atchanaidu's relative.

In Chandrababu Naidu's rule, the electricity charges for polishing units have been increased by Rs 8 per unit. Employees of Metkore Ferro Alloys were staging a protest against the management demanding payment of salary dues, while I was passing by, he said.

Speaking about the protests against Kakarapalli power plant, YS Jagan recalled that in 2014 Chandrababu Naidu promised to cancel permissions for the plant. Fishermen were losing their livelihood while 51 villages were living in danger. In Bhavanapadu Port project, the farmers' lands were acquired for cheap prices only to benefit the rich and powerful.

YS Jagan said the locals who were affected by cyclone Titli are still awaiting compensation. Fake cheques have been in circulation in the aftermath of the cyclone, he said reading out anonymous names owho were said to have been awarded the compensation.

Chandrababu released just Rs 520 crores while the damage evaluated in the Titli cyclone was Rs 3,400 crore.

The Opposition leader mocked Chandrababu's claims of controlling the ocean currents in cyclone Phethai. While the cyclone was on, Chandrababu took a special flight to the swearing-in of chief ministers in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.

Does Chandrababu's Real Time Governance System predict the cyclone effect better than that of IMD and ISRO? Did you send a satellite into the space for estimating weather conditions? he asked Chandrababu. YS Jagan recalled that late Chief Minister Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy signed an MOU with ISRO in 2006.

Doesn't the RTGS system remind Chandrababu on the pending Rs 87,600 crore farm loans?

Doesn't the RTGS stystem remind Chandrababu on the pending loans of the women's self help groups?

""Only Nara Lokesh was employed with a minister's post in the last four years.""

In Chandrababu's rule, the electricity charges, fuel prices, RTC bus charges, house tax , school fees etc. have skyrocketed. Chandrababu, who promised to provide nine hours of electricity to farmers, did not keep his word. Besides, the TDP is collecting huge revenue in the form of electricity bills, he said.

In 2014, Chandrababu vowed to ban all liquor shops in the state. But, after four years of his rule, he has ensured that every village had a liquor shop, YS Jagan said.

Chandrababu's opprtunism and antics have touched new heights with his friendship with the Congress. After having abused Congress leaders post-bifurcation, he is now befriending the Congress. He had planned on spending crores of Rupees to buy out MLAs in Telangana. In the process, he was caught red-handed in note for vote case. His friendship with the Congress is only to protect himself from facing prosecution in the cases and corruption charges.

Just a few months back, the Congress leaders released a book on Chandrababu's deceptions and corruption charges. Chandrababu took a massive U-turn in demand for the Special Category Status (SCS) after accepting the special package.

YS Jagan recalled the golden days of Dr YSR. He lashed out at Chandrababu Naidu for ignoring the interests of lakhs of students with the scrapping of fee reimbursement.

After coming to power, we are going to transform the lives of the poor in the State, he said while explaining the benefits of Navarathnalu."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: A farmer couple cultivates land near Udaipur in Rajasthan. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

TRADITION VERSUS MODERNITY: Farmers in Rajawas village in Jaipur district. (Photographs by Purushottam Diwakar)

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

A DIFFERENT TREATMENT: Patients crowd a makeshift clinic in Patna in Bihar. (Photo: Purushottam Diwakar)

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

Initially, my journalistic inquisitiveness didn't surprise him much but as we passed the suburbs and entered the city, his enthusiasm matched mine. Suddenly at the turn of a road, he announced, ""This is where Sean Connery lived... and delivered milk in his younger days."" This sudden shattering of a romantic/glamorous image of one of the most handsome Bonds came as little more than a surprise to me. Then he continued, ""Well, he delivered milk to my grandmother and many others like her, every morning, going around on a bicycle."" Oh! It must have been wonderful to see a handsome lad bringing milk every morning and deliver with a sunny smile! Wonder how many girls sighed after he left and how many spent sleepless nights for the morning to dawn and for the budding Bond (Sean Connery) to appear!

As we passed the Castle, Derek swelled with pride and shared some details. The castle is Edinburgh's jewel in the crown that dominates the skyline of the city: it is admired by the city folk every day from every angle. The castle stands upon the plug of an extinct volcano, which is estimated to have risen about 350 million years ago. As one of the most important strongholds in the Scottish Kingdom, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts. I decided to allocate some time to the castle but on another day.

I checked into the iconic Scotsman Hotel ideally located on North Bridge between the Royal Mile and Princess Street. The hotel is an Edwardian building which had housed The Scotsman newspaper for nearly a century and boasts a rich history which reflects in its architecture and décor.

Guide John joined us at lunch at the Scottish Café and took us on a walking tour. As we walked on the lush green lawns and looked around, the tall, gothic and imposing clock tower appeared yonder. John said it never shows the correct time. Then why the clock? ""It is always five minutes ahead so that those who catch the trains are never late!"", he chuckled. Impressed with the wisdom of Edinburgh elders, we all chorused, ""Awww...it's so cute!"" Well, it is the same ploy that our parents engaged during our school days.

We walked up to The Scottish National Gallery, which is home to the country's sensational collection of fine art, from the early Renaissance to the late nineteenth century. We spent an hour strolling through the magnificent neoclassical building, looking at great works of art. Rembrandt was visiting the UK and there was an exhibition of his works in the adjacent building: I reserved it for a leisurely visit later, as Rembrandt is one of my favourite painters and deserves more time and attention.

The lively bagpipe music played by the buskers gave an intense feeling of being in Scotland. We walked through the Princess Street Gardens that were filled with lovely flowers: I was much impressed by a floral clock and the stunning fountain adorned with classic sculptures. The castle made an impressive backdrop staring at us from the top.

John compared the old town and the new town of Edinburgh to Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde saying that a young architect designed the New Town for the middle class when they left the higgledy-piggledy old town to escape the stench. Packed with medieval dwellings, narrow streets the Old Town had a quaint charm against a sweeping elegance that swathes the Georgian New Town.

We walked through the Royal Mile, the heart of Edinburgh. Running through the centre of Old Town, impressive, towering tenements flank it, between which cobbled closes and narrow stairways interlock to create a secret underground world that reminds me of Shambles in York (England). Just a short walk away is the Grassmarket - once a medieval marketplace and site for public executions. Now the Grassmarket is a vibrant area buzzing with lively drinking spots and eclectic shops. Its detailed medieval architecture, stunning castle views and dynamic atmosphere make it one of the city's most-loved places. Though Grassmarket executions ceased in the 1700s, some of the traditional pubs in the area still keep the tales of its chequered past alive. Of course, the sandstone buildings have blackened with time and do look dirty from outside.

Edinburgh is said to be the world's leading festival city and the Old Town's bohemian, busiest areas buzz with activity during these festivals, turning every shop, bar and available space into a venue. They are said to be a treat: outstanding festivals flood the city in the summer with colour and heart-thumping excitement, while the autumn nights are illuminated by the Scottish International Storytelling Festival.

The undulations of the city add magic and for some events, the ubiquitous castle makes a dramatic backdrop. Out of the many book festivals, art festivals, dance and music festivals, their New Year festival of three days with fireworks attracts thousands to start the journey of life afresh. And the celebrations continue, to celebrate life and its every precious facet.

The students demanded an annual hike, based on inflation and cost of living. They haven't seen a hike for the past four years, they claimed. Holding placards, they formed a human chain from the main gate to the administrative building.

The institutes included International Centre for Theoretical Sciences (ICTS), Raman Research Institute (RRI), Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), National Institute of Advanced Studies (NIAS), Institute of Wood Science and Technology (IWST) and Bangalore University (BU).

Vivek Sharma, 28, chairman of the Student Council at IISc said, ""We demand Rs 50,000 for junior research fellows pursuing PhD, from the current Rs 25,000, and Rs 56,000 for senior research fellows from the existing Rs 28,000, which has not been increased since 2014. We also want annual increments based on inflation and cost of living.""

They pointed out that some of the married researchers had the responsibility of supporting their spouses, aging parents and children. ""My wife is back home and luckily, is supported by my parents. We don't have children but some research scholars have to pay their children's school fees, and sustenance becomes difficult with the paltry sum they get,"" he added.

Students pursuing their Masters demanded Rs 22,500 from the existing Rs 12,400, which was last fixed in 2014. Undergraduate students haven't seen a hike since 2008, and their stipend has remained Rs 5,000.

There are 4,000 research scholars in IISc alone, among who around 2,500 are pursuing their PhDs. ""We have submitted our demands to the director and he agreed to forward it to the Department of Science and Technology, ministry of Human Resources Development and Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. The institute's hands are tied in this matter, we're told. We also want timely disbursal of funds,"" he said.

Gaurav Solra, 21, an undergraduate physics student, said that they get Rs 5,000 only for the first three years.

Monmun Bhasin, 26, is a Computational Biology PhD student. ""I get Rs 25,000 as a junior research fellow and don't live on campus. I have to pay rent with that money and also have medical bills as I have health issues,"" she said. There was no response from the director's office on this agitation by the students."

But how many of you have heard about the one that awakens the architect laying latent in you? Well, don't be surprised. There actually is a competition that has been on for the past 26 years. The House Plan Drawing Competition envisaged and organised A R S Vadhyar, managing trustee, Yasoram Charitable Trust, has till date helped many students realise their true calling.

According to Vadhyar, who is also managing director of Yasoram Builders, the competition was a result of his desire to impart the knowledge he gained in the construction field to the younger generation. ""More and more young talents need to take up this job. People are not aware of the immense possibilities that learning the nuances of architecture brings them. An exceptional architect who can design a house as per the needs of the client is always in great demand,"" he said.

""But like everything else, the skill needs to be identified in the early years. Children are very perceptive. So, I realised that if you want to bring in a revolution, they are the right people to approach,"" said Vadhyar who has been in the construction industry for the past 42 years. Thus, was born the house plan drawing competition.

The competition is not something frivolous. ""The students are provided with a training class before the competition to give an idea of what all this is about. However, one thing which I have noticed in all these years is that kids are quick to learn and the product they generate has wowed even seasoned architects,"" said the builder, who is famed to have constructed a concrete house in 24 hours in the 1970s.

Usually, the children who participate in the competition are from the LP, UP, high school and the higher secondary, he said. ""But in the past few years, a lot of kindergarten students too have shown interest in taking part in the competition,"" he said. Vadhyar said, ""It is amazing how the kids as young as five come up with precision plans.""

The rules of the competition stipulate children have to draw the plan as per the dimensions provided by the organisers. ""If the plan misses the dimension by even a decimal point, it is not considered for the prize. However, since this year we received many great plans that missed out on the prize due to miscalculation of the dimensions, we have decided to give a prize that will recognise their talent,"" he said.

According to Vadhyar, the competition has benefitted many children. ""Many of the children who had participated in the competition have taken up architecture and are today doing very well in their jobs. I feel very happy when parents call me up and thank me for helping guide their kids in the right direction,"" he said. One of his proteges is the daughter of the headmistress of St Albert's LP School, Kochi.

""Her daughter did her Bachelors and post graduation in architecture. She is doing well today. She wants to share her experience with the parents of the other students. Another factor has her all buoyed up. This year, she had entered her students in the competition and one of her Class III students have bagged the first prize,"" he said.

The prize distribution of the competition will be held at Yasoram Building near the Public Library on Sunday at 10 am."

In a breathless 2018, they were just a handful of headlines on immigration, one of the year's most dominant issues.

Combined with a relentless stream of administrative memos and changes in regulation and enforcement, it represented a government bombardment on virtually every type of immigration -- a bold follow-up to the opening salvo of President Donald Trump's first year in office.

For those who champion Trump and believe that cracking down on immigration translates to better lives for Americans, it has been a year of fulfillment of campaign promises. For those who've watched in horror, it harkened back to other points in the country's history, when fear of new arrivals led the US to refuse entry to various groups and when open discrimination of certain ethnicities prevailed.

READ | US President Donald Trump's Mexico border wall going up in Texas

""This is our generation's sort of existential moment,"" said Frank Sharry, head of pro-immigration group America's Voice. ""Are we going to continue to be a nation that practices 'e pluribus unum' and welcomes people from around the world to make this country better? Or are we going to shut the door?""

Throughout 2018, the answer has largely been the latter.

Even as roundups and deportations persist in targeting those who enter the US illegally, the Trump administration has pushed beyond that to redefine what legal immigration looks like, too. It has slowed down or altogether halted many seeking to come to the country for a job offer or through their relationship to a citizen, and narrowed the chances of finding a home here as a refugee or asylum seeker. Jarring visuals of children in detention centers and other enforcement actions have dissuaded some from seeking to come here at all.

""There has been this constant chip, chip, chipping away at the legal immigration system using every tool of the executive branch,"" said Doug Rand, who worked in the Obama administration before helping found Boundless Immigration, which helps people navigate the immigration system.

The year neared its close with the administration saying those seeking asylum would be forced to wait in Mexico, a major shift that immediately spurred questions of legality from opponents. Meantime, the possibility of a government shutdown loomed as Trump and Democrats once again butted heads over funding to build a wall along the border with Mexico.

Even without it, though, the policies he's pursued have effectively put up a virtual wall.

""That is far more effective than a border wall ever would be,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.

Even top-tier computer programmers, architects, engineers and other professionals with job offers in the US saw their applications for H1-B visas under much more scrutiny; a means of expediting processing of those visas was ended under Trump, and bids for work authorization have been met by what employers and immigration attorneys say seem like endless requests for evidence to prove seemingly straightforward facts.

Still, the odds of those professionals eventually gaining clearance to enter the US are better than for many others.

Trump's so-called ""travel ban,"" the first iteration of which was unveiled in the president's first week in office, was upheld in June by the US Supreme Court, stopping most visas for residents of mostly Muslim Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as North Korea and Venezuela. Though the policy allows for waivers, initial data showed few such applications were actually approved, effectively shutting the door to most from those nations.

It's had very real consequences for people like Soolmaz Dadgari, an Iranian who came to the US in 2017 so her 4-year-old daughter, Arina, could take part in an experimental study to treat a rare genetic disorder. Dadgari's husband has been unable to get a visa to join them, and sanctions make it hard for him to send money. She alone cares for a child who can't walk or talk and requires 24-hour help, as well as another 11-year-old daughter.

Dadgari has considered returning home but knows she needs to remain for her daughter's treatment. Still, the situation has affected the way she views the U.S., which she had always regarded as the best place in the world.

""I have no hope,"" she said.

Even as wars, persecution and famine have continued around the world, the US capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the lowest ceiling since the State Department began tracking the figure in 1980. Far fewer were actually admitted in that time frame: about 21,000 refugees. The number is likely to fall further, with the cap for the current fiscal year set at 30,000.

Meantime, tens of thousands fleeing violence in Central America sought asylum in the US this year. The Trump administration responded by narrowing who is eligible, declaring that neither those escaping gang violence or domestic abuse nor those who cross the border illegally qualify. Both changes have been blocked by federal courts.

Some seeking refuge in the US are stuck in untenable positions.

Ivis Muñoz, 26, decided to join a caravan leaving Honduras in mid-October. A gang member had shot him in the thigh and threatened to kill him. Muñoz planned to seek asylum in the US but learned along his journey that he was unlikely to be accepted.

His first night in Tijuana, Mexico, he slept on the beach until rocks rained down on him and other migrants and a man shouted in the darkness: ""Go back to your country!"" Now he's a few hours east in Mexicali, his aching leg full of bullet fragments, overwhelmed and scared by his reality.

""I don't know what to do,"" said Munoz, a coffee farmer from the Honduran town of Atima. ""I want to go to the United States, though I'm scared they'll send me back. I'm afraid to be in Honduras, but I don't feel safe here either.""

At every turn, there were policy changes. One proposed rule would restrict visas or legal permanent residence for those receiving certain government benefits for low-income people, such as food stamps. Hundreds of immigrant enlistees in the Army were discharged or had their contracts cancelled, though some were later reinstated. Even some US citizens were targeted by a ""denaturalization task force"" looking for naturalized Americans with past infractions.

More than any other shifts in policy, the Trump administration's move to separate apprehended migrant children from their parents shook people around the world. Though Trump eventually ended widespread use of the practice, the scars remain for those affected.

Evelin Roxana Meyer of La Union, Honduras, thought 2018 would be the year things turned around for her family. They've struggled to pay off a loan for the grocery store they run out of their home, so her husband, Douglas, and son, Eduardo, set off for the United States in hopes of finding work. Instead, the two were picked up by Border Patrol agents and separated.

The father was deported, but it took weeks before the parents knew where Eduardo was taken. He spent four months in detention, turning 12 alone at a facility in Brownsville, Texas. The once-affectionate boy returned home angry in September. He rarely goes out, spending most of his time in his room watching TV. He's refused to go to school and will have to repeat the sixth grade. He talks back to his parents and hits his little sister, whom he used to be close to. The family doesn't know what to do to help him.

""This was the toughest year of all,"" said 38-year-old Meyer.

Polling finds a big majority of Americans still view the country's openness to immigrants as essential to the nation's identity. But the profound shift in government policies on the subject threatens that idea of the US as a welcoming land of opportunity for all.

Christina Greer, a political science professor at Fordham University, sees Trump's immigration overhaul as the continuation of a tug-of-war that's played out since the nation's founding, between what many see as bedrock American ideals and a pattern of nevertheless being hostile to newcomers.

""The country, unfortunately, has had an incongruence with the myth of America versus the reality of America,"" said Greer, who authored ""Black Ethnics: Race, Immigration, and the Pursuit of the American Dream."" ''Trump's really fine with blowing up the myth.""

Sharry thinks the country's reputation suffers when its leaders close the doors to others: ""They've put a million people on the road to deportation. They've ripped thousands of kids from their parents. They've gutted refugee protection at our border. They're building and expanding detention centers. They're trying to scare low-income immigrants from using health and other services. They've taken aim at legal immigration. They've slashed refugee admissions. That's a pretty relentless assault on a core principal of the American experiment.""

Others see it far differently.

Neil Gouveia came to the US from Guyana as a 7-year-old. His family waited years to earn visas, then waited again to become citizens. His parents made the difficult choice to leave behind his 9-year-old sister, who had cerebral palsy and wasn't granted a visa.

Gouveia considered himself a typical ""liberal New Yorker"" until 2016, when he was drawn to Trump for what he believed was his strength on national security. Gouveia is gay and said the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, particularly shook him.

He wasn't offended when Trump referred to parts of the world as ""shithole countries,"" and doesn't see anything inherently wrong in separating immigrant children from the adults they arrive with. He thinks, ultimately, it will all lead to greater dialogue and better policies. And he still believes America stands as a beacon for much of the world.

""At the end of the day, people will say what they want to say about America, but there's hardly anyone who still wouldn't want to come here,"" said Gouveia, 39, a collegiate fundraiser. ""They still know it's like winning the lottery.""

Daniel Stein heads the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports restrictive immigration measures. He agrees the year's immigration imagery has had ""a huge political impact on the psyche of the nation,"" but argues it has moved more people to his side of the debate. And to those who see the year as an extended assault on a cornerstone American value, he's unmoved.

""They have a vivid imagination,"" Stein said. ""We have one of the world's most generous immigration programs.""

That's little comfort to Buena Ventura Martin Godinez, a 29-year-old mother of two who carried her 9-month-old son across the border in May, fleeing threats from violent gangsters in her hometown of San Juan Atitan, Guatemala. She was caught in Arizona and held for a week at a detention center with her baby. When her husband followed two weeks later with their 7-year-old daughter, they weren't so lucky.

The girl was sent to a facility in Michigan and kept there for six weeks; the father went to an Atlanta jail, where he still awaits deportation. Her family fractured, Godinez now regrets the day she ever headed to the U.S.

""I came looking for a better life ... and everything went wrong,"" she said from the five-room house in Homestead, Florida, that she and her two children share with nine others. ""I thought that it was true that it is a country that gives opportunities. But it is not.""

Godinez notices changes in her children. Her daughter, always so sweet and obedient, cries incessantly and struggles in school. Her son keeps falling ill, his temperament now trademarked by screaming, crying and sighing."

On Friday, 21 December, Lok Sabha was informed by Minister of State for Women and Child Development Virendra Kumar that there are 24 lakh staffers who work in anganwadis across India. Currently, over two lakh posts for the workers and helpers at anganwadis are vacant.

For the beneficiaries, a package comprising of immunisation, health check-up, supplementary nutrition, referral services, health education and pre-school non-formal education are being provided.

In a written reply, he said that about 1.09 lakh positions are vacant for anganwadi workers and 1.18 lakh for helpers, Deccan Herald reported. The vacancies are highest in Bihar as 53,000 positions are unoccupied.

Apart from the above, 86.15 per cent of anganwadis are functioning on concrete buildings, while 13.85 per cent are running it using make-shift building. There are about 13.63 lakh anganwadis in India.

Deccan Herald quoted Kumar as saying, ""The government has made provision of funds for providing medicine kit of Rs 1,500 per annum for anganwadi centres and Rs 750 per annum for mini-aganwadi centres and other administrative expenses under anganwadi services are Rs 2,000 per annum for anganwadi centres and Rs 1,000 per annum for mini-anganwadi centres."""

Adrien Locatelli, a high-school student from Grenoble in France, apparently translated religious passages from the holy books of Bible and Quran into DNA codes and then transmitted them into his body. He built unknown proteins from these DNA sequences. He translated the religious texts into building blocks of DNA and it did not matter to him whether injecting them into his body would cause any harm.

DNA and proteins are written with letters and have a fixed structure. A DNA strand is made up of chemicals which are denoted by ACGT and genes are codes prepared with these 4 letters. In the recent studies, it was found that it is possible to convert any sort of information to DNA for storage. Locatelli decided to try it with religious texts and injected it into his body to try out. The biohacker used himself as the mouse of his experiment.

For this, he downloaded digital versions of the religious books and then gave the character a specific nucleotide. After the tedious tasks of translations, he converted them into protein using an online tool. It gave him a protein sequence and he created them with amino acids. It was time to test it out. So he injected the religious coded DNA into his thigh. It did not give him much of an effect, other than soreness for about 2 days. It did not really affect him and he was just happy with the success of the experiment. Although trying something like injecting other DNA proteins can sometimes have dangerous effects on one's body."

Corporations around the world are making special efforts to make their organizations places where talented employees from all walks of lives and cultures find acceptance and appreciation. The need for creating inclusive workplaces is today propelled not just by social and moral responsibility but also by the realization that diversity brings long term benefits.

Opening your arms to a wide talent pool brings benefits that often traditional recruiters fail to comprehend. An anecdote here might help to drive home the point. A senior marketing manager interviewing fresher candidates for a sales opening once gave his interviewees a few sheets of paper and asked them about ideas on how to sell them. While someone made a notebook out of them, another turned them into toy boats.

One of the candidates who was a formidable athlete during student days pulled out the idea of converting those sheets into a sporty activity book for children by creating interesting puzzles and crossword games! The marketing manager was sold out for the last candidate despite the fact that he had an unremarkable academic career with no other field experience. This is just one example of how people with different backgrounds can bring enriching ideas and problem solving skills to the table.

In a rapidly changing world where straight-jacketed ideas of work are making way for new professions as well as unconventional ways of working within traditional professions, the ideas of what recruiters look for in their employees are also changing. No more is a sabbatical considered a negative void on your resume; rather interviewers are keen to know how you enriched yourself as an individual during that key break from work. Candidates are actively being asked about what they do outside work as organizations try to drill down to get a better overall perspective on the candidate.

Diversity beyond gender

While forging diversity is a hot subject across the corporate world, the emphasis largely is on making workplaces more gender inclusive. However, diversity is a concept that has far reaching implications and must stretch to all candidates who are 'different' from the majority. This includes differently-abled people, ethnic and cultural minorities, as well as candidates from smaller towns and non-urban backgrounds. Promoting diversity not only implies providing a level playing field for all such candidates but also ensuring that they do not face any sort of discrimination at workplace. The workplace should be free from sexist or racist slurs. Biases are often part of social settings, but an organization as an ethical institution has to ensure that individual employees do not carry such individual attitudes to the workplace.

The need for ensuring gender diversity is a well recognized concept across the corporate world today. However, increasingly organizations are also making efforts to enrich their talent pool by adding creative voices to it as well as candidates whose core talents may lie outside academics.

Having a few mavericks on board

If you put 10 people with exactly similar backgrounds - urban, male, upper middle class -- on a project, the ideas that emerge from this group are likely to be limited. On the other hand, if you entrust a problem to a group with people from diverse backgrounds - men, women, small towners and people with creative instincts, it is more likely to throw different types of solutions. It all boils down to having different minds at work and access to a wider talent pool.

Globally, organizations are making special efforts to give opportunities to opportunity deprived differently-abled people with autism, down syndrome, speech and hearing defects or those with physical disabilities. Experts believe such employees do not just add a touch of conscious capitalism and social responsibility to organizations but are also much more dedicated, loyal with lower attrition rates. In India, this concept has only now started receiving attention.

A large number of athletes in India play a variety of sports during school and college, some even making to district and state teams. Most of them do not turn pro and drop out from the sport to look for traditional jobs. Their discipline, physical and mental fitness, competitive spirit and dedication to team building makes up for what they lack in the field of academics. A 2014 research at Cornell University in the US found that people who played competitive sports during secondary school, displayed better leadership and success rates throughout their careers. Similarly, people from creative arts can bring their own creative approaches to problem solving which may add vibrance to an organization.

Making your culture amenable to all

There might be a brilliant computer programmer who is specially-abled and has different needs as an employee. There might be another remarkable data analyst who stammers and finds it hard to impress people with his verbal communication. As an employer, will you let go the services of such talents because they do not fit in? Or will you work to create an environment that is amenable to them and welcomes them into the organizational fold with open arms? This is a vital question that faces organizations today. Undoubtedly, creating more inclusive workplaces requires investment in time, money and effort, but it is worth making the effort.

Apart from removing biases during hiring, it is equally important to sensitize the workforce to be assimilative and appreciative of differences - be it of gender, background or physical ability. The leadership plays a vital role here by leading with example and showcasing the need to value diversity. Acceptance and belief for it flowing from top, makes it much easier for people to adapt.

Respecting each other's opinions and accepting the differences is the only way to create a workplace which is diverse, inclusive and well equipped for current and futuristic developments."

The Indian Premier League (IPL) auction for the 12th edition was huge for the Indian uncapped players. The franchise went haywire for them during the event and Varun Chakravarthy turned out to be the most expensive player along with Jaydev Unadkat. He was snapped up by the Kings XI Punjab for a whopping amount of Rs 8.4 crores.

However, before becoming the millionaire, Varun had almost given up cricket and didn't see a future in the sport. He joined Architecture in one of the top colleges in Chennai and was thinking about building and designing the houses. Though after two years, he decided to give another shot at the game he loved the most and the decision has changed his life forever now.

""At that point, I was thinking about how to design houses. I didn't see a future in cricket. That's why I went into architecture. I wanted to become an architect. But after two years into my job, I asked myself if I hadn't put my heart and soul into my first love, cricket. That's when I thought I will return to the game. I woke up one fine morning and had this thought. It was unforeseen. I was a bit frustrated with my job,"" he said while speaking to India Today.

Varun Chakravarthy was so much focussed on his architectural career that he didn't even think of cricket for seven years. During this period, even the matches on television didn't generate any interest in him as the mystery spinner felt he didn't belong at the highest level.

""Cricket was not part of my routine during those seven years. I was focussed on my work. Designing ate up a lot of my time. I was just playing a bit of tennis ball cricket but not professional cricket. I didn't even watch cricket matches often. During my school days, I watched a lot of cricket but after I stopped playing, I didn't have the urge to watch cricket because I felt I don't belong there,"" Varun further added.

CEO Darius Adamczyk isn't the type to play the hype man,so when he says he's ""extraordinarily excited"" about something, it's meaningful. Those were the words he used earlier this year to describe Honeywell's visionfor using technology to improve air travel and stake out a leading position in theburgeoning field of connected aircraft. It's Kristin Slyker's job to make that happen.

Slyker, 44, leadsthe company'sefforts to sell antennas that enable satellite communications, high-speed in-flight WiFi service and software that can improve fuel efficiency, predict maintenance needs and help pilots plan flights. It's a job she says she never would have envisioned for herself when she joined the companymore than 16 years ago in an information-technology role. Having grown up in the Phoenix area, where Honeywell Aerospace's headquarters are located, she graduated from Arizona State University's W.P. Carey School of Businesswith a degree in computer information systems.But with a father who served in the Air National Guard, airplanes were an important part - and occasional playground - of Slyker's childhood.

""This job brings it full circle,"" Slyker, vice president of connected-aircraft customers and partnerships, said in a Dec. 4 interview on board Honeywell's Boeing Co. 757 test plane as we circled the Grand Canyon. The plane, stripped of most passenger accoutrements save for a dozen or so seats, now serves as a flying laboratory for Honeywell's latest innovations. These include its GoDirect software services and connected radar that crowdsources information from other planes, satellites and ground systemsto give pilots a more complete and accurate picture of the weather.

One reason Slyker may not have envisioned her job is that it didn't officially exist until early 2017, when Honeywell Aerospace CEO Tim Mahoney established connected aircraft as its own business and tapped her to lead it. Connectivity is in Honeywell's DNA: the company has been enabling cockpit satellite communications since the 1980s, and has a long history with radar and flight-planning services. The turning point for converting its connected-aircraft aspirations into a full-fledged business was when it gained theability to pair those traditional offerings with big-data mining and real-time information, Slyker says. The market also had to be ready for next-generation technologies.

Buzzwords like ""connected"" and ""digital"" tend to translate as ""overplayed"" and ""expensive"" to industrial investors bruised by General Electric Co.'s poorly executed foray into software. Honeywell has pitched its connected-aircraft business as a means to make its aerospace unit, the company's largest, less vulnerable to economic slumps. Demand for connectivity upgrades and software services isn't dictated by flight hours or gross domestic product to the same extent as new planepurchases and traditional repair work, Ben Driggs, president of services and connectivity at Honeywell Aerospace, said in an interview.The big question, as it was for GE, is whether this can be a new source of revenuefor Honeywellor if these investments are simply necessary to maintain its hold on high-margin maintenance work, says Scott Davis, CEO of Melius Research.

It's easy to understand the business model for Honeywell's JetWave equipment that enables reliable WiFi even over oceans. The company also sells access to that connection via adistribution agreement with satellite communications operator Inmarsat Plc.In an increasingly connected world, the ability to be plugged in and entertained at all times holds appeal for passengers -and for the airlines that can charge them for that service.The less tangible part of Honeywell's connected-aircraft push is the idea of using data harvested from plane parts to improve operations.United Technologies Corp.'s $30 billion takeover of avionics maker Rockwell Collins Inc. is a bet that scale will help it get ahead in connected aircraft, but Honeywell is prioritizing quality over quantity.What works in Honeywell's favor,Davissays, is its bottom-up mindset.

The company starts with a known problem - like the delays passengers can face while an airline tracks down a fueling truck from the other end of the airport - and then tries to find a way to solve it via software and data analytics. In this case, it's Honeywell's GoDirect Ground software, which uses data scraped from fueling and baggage-sorting trucks to give operators better awareness of how their fleet is being used, allowing them to allocate vehicles more efficiently and improve turnaround times.(2) It sounds simplistic, but it's easy to spend a lot of money in software and wind up with offerings people aren't willing to pay for. ""I'm not going to build my infrastructure in the hope that I'm going to find a problem to solve,"" Slyker said.""I'm building my infrastructure to solve the problems I know exist.""

She has unique insight into what those problems are. Before coming to Honeywell, Slyker worked in programming andprogram management at Accenture with a focus on the oil and gas industry. She drew on that background at Honeywell as she transitioned from IT, working first with the team that decided what next-generation business jet technologies the company should invest in before eventually handlingplanning and controls for the commercial-aviation business's$1 billion annual research and development budget. She also spent about four years as vice president of commercial-customer operations for Honeywell's integrated supply-chain team, which is a fancy way of saying she had to manage cranky phone calls if deliveries didn't show up or quality issues arose. This isn't a job I envy, but it trained her to make customers' needs the starting point for decision-making.

That mentality is paying off. Swissport International, the world's largest ground-service provider, inked a deal this month to deploy GoDirect Ground across its operations.No financial terms were disclosed, but the 13% reduction in maintenance costs Swissport reported after applying Honeywell's service across five ground-handling stations earlier this year was enough to entice it to sign up for a bigger project.

The benefit of Honeywell's multi-faceted approach to connected aircraft is that it doesn't necessarily need to earn billions of dollars in revenue from predictive-maintenance software to be successful in this industry. In addition to satellite antennas, Honeywell also sells a little gray box it calls the Aircraft Data Gateway, which gives airlines a way to securely and wirelessly transfer information on and off a plane. It's what makes this whole idea of connected-aircraft and real-time information work, so you can see the appeal even for airlines thatmay prefer to build data-analytics capabilities in house. Honeywell's predictive-maintenance offerings should also allow the company to save costs on its own repair work: if you know something will break ahead of time, it tends to be a more minor (and less expensive) fix.

All of this math is made easier by the fact that Honeywell hasn't been throwing money around willy-nilly on software. Its connected-aircraft operations blossomed out of three acquisitionsand,true to Honeywell form, they were niche and reasonably priced. The company bought wireless-connectivity company EMS Technologies for $491 million in 2011 and then paid an undisclosed amount to acquire fuel efficiency software-maker Aviaso and in-flight airtime provider Satcom1 in 2015.

Connectivity is a squishy word that many companies abuse, but Slyker and Honeywell have a concrete approach to it that should pay off one way or another.

Two years back when theatre director Nimi Ravindran, 43, got a grant to teach theatre to students at a public school, she was confident her fluency in the local language, Kannada, would be enough to communicate with the students. Instead she found that all but one of 20 fifth graders at a Kannada-medium public school in Bengaluru's Marathahalli area spoke Bengali.

""Most of them said they were from West Bengal. I wondered what these children were doing so far from home,"" Ravindran said. As she started conducting workshops in Hindi, that the children were somewhat familiar with, their stories started flowing.

""They spoke about the trees near their homes, the spirits that lived in them and the clean air. They missed their home,"" Ravindran recalled.

The Sundarban delta--nearly one million hectare in area--is formed at the point where the rivers Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna merge into the Bay of Bengal. The delta is extremely fertile as the three rivers carry an estimated one billion tonnes of sediments.

Nearly 40% of Sundarban--the world's largest mangrove forest, three times as large as Goa--is in India, the rest is in neighbouring Bangladesh.

Sundarban (literally 'beautiful forest') features in the list of UNESCO's 209 natural heritage sites in the world for supporting ""an exceptional level of biodiversity in its terrestrial, marine and aquatic habitats"".

Over the last 40 years, Sundarban has lost 220 sq km--nearly the size of Kolkata--to the sea, according to Sugata Hazra, director of the School of Oceanographic Studies at Jadavpur University.

As rising sea levels engulf entire islands, residents are migrating en masse, from the Bangladesh as well as the Indian side of Sundarban.

Not all are environmental migrants, but with no documentation of this kind of migration, the numbers are hard to estimate.

But ripples of this migration are being felt over 2,000 km to the southwest. As many as 40% of students in some Kannada-medium government schools in Bengaluru speak Bengali, according to the Samridhdhi Trust that runs bridge schools to help these children cope.

IndiaSpend tracked some of these migrants from Sundarbans to the Kalihata slum in east Bengaluru's Marathahalli area. Studies show that several districts of West Bengal, not just in Sundarban but across the state, are extremely vulnerable to the impact of climate change.

By 2060, nearly 1.4 billion people across the world will be at risk of becoming environmental migrants, some internal and others flocking across borders. The annual rate of sea level rise is expected to triple by the year 2100, making agriculture as well as everyday life in low-lying places, like Sundarban, unsustainable.

This is the third story in our series on how climate change is disrupting people's lives (you can read the first story here and the second here). The series combines ground reporting from India's climate change hotspots with the latest scientific research, and highlights how people are adapting to the changing climate.

The Sundarban delta, home to the world's largest mangrove forest, is at risk from rising sea levels because of global warming.

One in 10 individuals living in a low-lying coastal area on this planet is in India. Along with China, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Vietnam, India has the highest population that will be exposed to the impact of flooding and extreme weather events that the rising sea will bring, according to a 2015 study.

Human activities have already caused global warming by 1 degree Celsius, according to the September 2018 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world body for assessing science related to climate change. Governments of 195 countries are on this panel.

""Over 90% of the heat trapped in the climate system is actually in the oceans. As the oceans warm, just like liquid in a thermometer, it expands and (the) sea level rises,"" said John Church, research scientist and one of the lead authors for the chapter on sea level rise in the IPCC's fifth assessment report.

Melting of non-polar ice, like that in the Himalayas, the thermal expansion of oceans as they warm, and the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are pushing up global sea levels.

""With unmitigated emissions the sea level rise could be as much as one metre by 2100,"" Church said. If the entire ice sheet over Greenland were to melt, that alone would cause global sea levels to rise by seven metres. If all the ice sheets in Antarctica melt, it could push the levels up by another 55 m.

A video by the European Space Agency (ESA) explaining what contributes to sea-level rise.

Sea levels will continue to rise not just through the century but well past 2100. For people living on small islands, low-lying coastal areas and deltas, this means, at best, that more salt water from the sea will enter their fields making the soil unsuitable for agriculture, there will be increased flooding, frequent cyclones and infrastructure damage. At worst, it means the piece of land they call home would be under water.

Scanty research on the India side of Sundarban

The changing climate in the Bangladesh side of Sundarban is well documented but not much is known about the Indian side, according to Selvin Pitchaikani, an oceanographer at the Institute of Environmental Studies and Wetland Management (IESWM) in Kolkata.

Pitchaikani, who published his data on the changing weather patterns in Sundarban in 2017, found that the land is increasingly growing saline and that cyclonic storms have become frequent. Rainfall patterns have already changed, making conventional cultivation difficult for farmers, his research found.

But ""to come to any conclusion, we need data for a minimum of 20-25 years. We need more weather stations in the region as well as funding"", he said emphasising the need for more research.

With migration, children grow up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly

It's a four-hour car ride from Kolkata to the Sundarban delta region. Once here, a car becomes useless. To reach the island of Mousuni, it's another hour-long journey of switching between electricity-powered rickshaws while on small stretches of land, and small boats to cross the streams.

Electricity reached Mousuni--one of the larger islands in the delta with a population of over 25,000--a year ago, trailing climate change by decades.

Mousuni is an island in the Sundarban delta with a population of over 25,000 residents. Frequent floods and the rising sea level have forced many to migrate from Mousuni.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, grew up in Mousuni. His home is on the coast overlooking the Bay of Bengal. ""We used to grow rice and chillies but a decade back there was severe flooding. After that the crops haven't grown,"" Sufi said, holding his three-year-old son Abdul Rehman over his shoulder. Once their land became infertile due to salt water, they learnt to fish. Now, six months a year, Sufi travels over 2,000 km to Kerala to work as a construction worker earning about Rs 300 a day.

Like Sufi, nearly 96% of these environmental migrants are headed to other areas within India, according to a study of 1,315 households in the region. The study was conducted by Deltas, Vulnerability & Climate Change: Migration and Adaptation (DECCMA), a consortium of researchers from universities in UK, Ghana, Bangladesh and India.

Of these migrants, 83% are men and 17% women. Most are young; between the ages 21 and 30. The men interviewed for the study said they were moving for employment opportunities as agriculture was unsustainable. The women were moving to either join their husbands post marriage or to live with other family members.

Left behind are the elderly, children and most women.

""There are two types of migrations--proactive, who plan their retreat from the coast in advance and reactive, who move only when there is no other alternative left. In Sundarban we are still witnessing reactive migration,"" said Indrila Guha, principal at Basanti Devi College, Kolkata and a researcher in environmental economics.

Children growing up without a parent, fewer people to care for the elderly, and poor women who could become easy targets for traffickers, are some of the potential fallouts of this situation, according to Guha.

For the ones who move with their families in tow, life continues to remain tough. The children in Bengaluru's bridge schools struggle to adjust to life in the city, the language barrier making it even more challenging for them to adjust. Parents frequently move in search of jobs and education is one of the first casualties.

Residents adapt to rising seas

As the onslaught of the sea continued, Sufi's home was reduced to rubble. During high tide, the sea waves wash away chunks of his house. On a low tide day, like the one when IndiaSpend visited, his home provides a view of the sea that tourists scout the globe for.

Sufi, his wife and young son live with a neighbour. ""We have no money to build another home. Where can we go?"" he said, with eyes downcast.

Sheikh Sufi, 27, outside his destroyed home in Mousuni. Sufi works as a construction worker over 2,000 km away in Kerala for six months in a year.

""We have no policies directed at rehabilitation and resettlement of people who have lost their land due to sea level rise and coastal erosion,"" said Hazra, of Jadavpur University.

Rainfall is usually heavy, and severe cyclonic storms frequent. This area receives 1,501-2,500 mm of rainfall, compared to the Indian average of 801-1,500 mm.

Those who haven't migrated try to adapt. Shabir Sheikh, 27 and Khushbanoo Bibi, 25, married for 12 years, are constructing a new home for themselves and their three children, on higher ground.

""During floods, the stove gets wet and so we are making sure in the new home it will be higher so flood waters don't reach it,"" Khushbanoo said. Most women here cook in the open, on mud stoves and firewood, which makes it impossible to cook during the floods.

Shabir Sheikh and his wife Khushbanoo Bibi's new home is being built at a higher level to keep flood waters at bay.

The government is helping by building embankments along the coast to stem the flood waters, and flood shelters to accommodate those affected by floods. There are no long-term policies to help relocate and rehabilitate residents.

Double burden of rehabilitation and poor health in Sundarban

Globally, of the regions in the low lying coastal areas at the risk of flooding, most are underdeveloped or developing.

Nearly a third of the children under the age of five in South-24 Parganas, the district where Mousuni is, are stunted--short for their age. Half of the households still lack modern sanitation facilities and as many six in every 10 women are anaemic. Yet, the district is now having to prioritise infrastructure to deal with climate change.

Depending on the material used to build the embankment, a one-km long section could cost as much as Rs 1 crore. As seas rise, locals plead for the government to build more walls even as they are aware that these are just short term measures against climate change.

Threat to biodiversity

More than 200 species of plants, 400 species of fishes and 300 species of birds, numerous phytoplankton, fungi, bacteria, zooplankton, reptiles, amphibians and more call Sundarban their home. Even within Sundarban, species differ depending on the salinity of the soil. Sundarban is also home to many threatened and endangered animals like the Royal Bengal tiger, estuarine crocodile and the Indian python.

The changing temperature of water and increased salinity and acidity in the soil has already impacted the region's biodiversity, according to studies by the Marine Science Department of Calcutta University and the Department of Biological Science of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata.

While the rising sea level impacts biodiversity, experts also blame human activity. ""If, for instance, there were no obstructions on the major rivers and flows were not diverted, eroded material would have reached the delta,"" said Anurag Danda, senior advisor for Climate Change Adaptation at the World Wildlife Fund.

""Between the Tehri dam (Uttarakhand) and Farraka barrage (Murshidabad, West Bengal), there are at least 1,000 interventions along the Ganges that either divert water or hold water resulting in much reduced sediment delivery,"" he explained.

Problems for nature and man will continue to grow as sea levels continue to rise, scientists say. ""The question would be not whether it would happen but how quickly it would happen,"" Church, co-author of the latest IPCC report, said.

What is the way out for those living along the coastline? Planned retreat to safer places, aided by the government, is the main option, Hazra said. ""It will be economically beneficial as a whole rather than keeping people there and rebuilding embankments."""

Homely and modest, those were the words that came to my mind as we walked through the gates of the SAI Gopichand National Badminton Academy in Hyderabad. I had always imagined the place to be a grand theatre, but it had a rather unremarkable facade for a place which had given Indian sports some of its biggest champions in the past decade.

As we entered the building and started to settle down, getting ready in turn for the busy schedule of interviews, I realised why this place had and continues to produce so many top quality athletes. This was more like a school, where India's finest badminton talents would submit themselves to the tutelage of 'Gopi Sir', who would then mould them into world beaters.

We were slowly putting our equipments in place as we were told that our big ticket interview was still a few hours away, until someone announced, ""please get your cameras ready, Sindhu is here."" I had last interviewed the shuttler on the eve of the opening season of India's first professional badminton league way back in 2013. Back then Sindhu was a shy teenager, still learning the ropes of handling her newfound success and most importantly the media.

READ: Sindhu scripts history, beats Okuhara to become first Indian to win world series title

The Sindhu who walked in a few moments later was a different person. Tall, lean and sinewy, her gait easy yet extremely confident. The Sindhu of now had travelled the world, won many titles, rubbed shoulders with celebrities from other walks of life and most importantly she was assured of her place among the legends of Indian sports, even if she were to retire the same day. It reflected in the calm and candour with which she handled my first question on tackling expectations and scrutiny at every step of her now fabled career.

""There is always scrutiny and pressure from the media. I am always told that I have to win. I do understand that I have a responsibility and it has only increased after the Olympic medal.

Every time I go on to the court people expect me to get a medal. It is tough and I can't win always but I still have to go out there and give my best. If you think about the expectations then there will be extra pressure. I believe in performing and the results follow and that keeps everyone happy,"" the 23-year old shuttler said.

At the time of the interview, Sindhu was preparing to launch one final campaign to end 2018 with a gold medal. The year so far had turned out to be one of near misses for her as she had lost in the summit clash of a few top bracket tournaments. But the young achiever said every medal that she wins motivates her to keep moving ahead.

""It has been really good that I have had lots of medals and that's what keeps pushing me and motivating me. This is only the start and there is a lot to come. Having all these medals behind me helps me believe that there is a long way to go,"" said Sindhu who would in a week's time from the interview go on to become the first Indian to win the year-ending BWF World Tour Finals title.

Talking about her equation with her mentor and national badminton coach Pullela Gopichand, Sindhu said that she had unwavering faith and belief in her coach. Sindhu has been seen looking at Gopichand for direction when things are not going her way in matches and the Rio Olympics silver medallist had an interesting explanation for that.

""Being Gopi sir's student for so long I know what he is trying to tell me when things aren't going my way on court. I know I have to change my plans when he points them out and I should be able to do it immediately. You need to believe in him to be able to make those changes and I believe in him.""

Sindhu has been involved in several see-saw battles in high profile matches and when asked about who her toughest opponent is, she had two names to give.

""I have had lot of tough and long matches. There are a couple of players with whom my matches have gone up and down. One is Okuhara and the other is the Olympic champion Carolina Marin. There are these players and I like facing the challenge against them.""

Talking about her life post the high of the Rio Olympics silver medal, Sindhu said that she is happy to be in the limelight and is enjoying every bit of it.

""Life has changed both on and off the court after the Rio Olympics medal. I have a lot of confidence on the court now and feel anything is possible. I also feel that I have improved my game. Off the court I do get recognised more now. People come for autographs and then there are the endorsements. Life has become busy but I am enjoying being in the limelight. When I was young I looked at those who were popular and wanted to be like them and now that I am in the limelight I must enjoy it.""

Sindhu will be representing her home town Hyderabad in the upcoming season of the Premier Badminton League and the shuttler is excited at the opportunity to play in front of her home fans.

""I am excited to be part of the Hyderabad Hunters team for this season of the PBL. Obviously there will be a lot of home support and I want to win the title for them. PBL is very exciting as we team up with a lot of different players and coaches. We interact with the foreign players and get to learn from them. Everyday in the PBL is a learning process.""

While the next Olympics is still more than a year away, people are already talking about whether badminton can produce India's next individual Olympic gold and Sindhu has her sights on the yellow metal.

""Definitely looking ahead to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo and that is the aim for everyone. I am working hard and will be aiming for the gold medal. It won't be easy but I have to work hard for it.""

There have been lot of theories and stories about Sindhu's equation with her compatriot and rival Saina Nehwal, who recently got married to fellow badminton player Parupalli Kashyap. When asked about their relationship off the court, Sindhu said they are on cordial terms.

""On court we have to play aggressively against each other but off the court we are friends. You don't need to be an enemy of someone's if you are not friends and we definitely aren't enemies. When we meet each other we are just friends,"" the champion shuttler signed off."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - At least one protester was killed in the northern Sudanese city of Atbara on Friday, the security chief said, as people took to the streets across the country for a third day against price rises and corruption.

Police fired teargas at groups who gathered in Atbara and the capital Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman after noon prayers, witnesses said, and residents reported hearing gunfire in surrounding areas and in the southern state of White Nile.

Web users reported problems accessing the internet, and some accused the government of blocking social media including Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp in a bid to stop protesters communicating. There was no comment on that from the government.

Public anger has been building over price rises and other economic hardships, including a doubling in the cost of bread this year and limits on bank withdrawals.

At least eight people died during larger protests on Thursday when some demonstrators called for the overthrow of President Omar al-Bashir.

Security services said they used restraint in containing demonstrations that on Thursday took place as far afield as Dongola to the north and al-Qadarif to the east - and a government spokesman said 'infiltrators' in the crowd had spread trouble.

In a rare press conference, the head of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), Salah Abdallah Mohamed Saleh, said seven people had been arrested in connection with the burning of ruling party office buildings in earlier protests.

""We recognise that we must have self-restraint and manage things wisely and take care of the lives of the people and of public property, and we are not bothered by demonstrations, but we are upset by the lapse in security,"" said Saleh, also known as Salah Gosh.

He said one person died during what he said was an attack on a police station in Atbara.

""LAPSE IN SECURITY""

Saleh blamed rebels with links to Israel whom he said had been brought into Sudan by a network based in Nairobi, Kenya, for inciting the violence. He did not offer evidence to back up the assertion.

Police had stepped up their presence outside Khartoum's main mosques ahead of the third day of demonstrations.

There were small-scale protests across at least eight neighbourhoods in the capital on Friday, but they were short-lived, witnesses said.

Authorities have declared states of emergency and curfews in cities in at least four of Sudan's 18 states, according to local media.

The education ministry suspended some school or university classes in the states of al-Qadarif, White Nile and Nile River, private TV channel Sudania 24 reported.

The ministry has also announced that it would shutter universities in Khartoum state and schools and kindergartens in the capital city.

Sudan's economy has struggled to recover from the loss of three quarters of its oil output - its main source of foreign currency - when South Sudan seceded in 2011.

Long lines continued to stretch outside of ATMs and bakeries in Khartoum early on Friday.

Bashir, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, took power in an Islamist and military-backed coup in 1989. Lawmakers this month proposed a constitutional amendment to extend term limits that would have required him to step down in 2020.

The announcement seems certain to complicate efforts to reach a peace deal, mostly because it gives the Taliban leverage by allowing them to hold off until a total US withdrawal, or step up their demands over a weakened Afghan government.

""I believe the Taliban will see this as a reason to stall, and therefore it disincentivizes the Taliban to actually talk to the Afghan government, which it has refused to do,"" said Bill Roggio an Afghanistan analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on US airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate, and Afghan military officials note the announcement by the Trump administration comes as the country's security is at its worst since 2014, when more than 100,000 NATO troops pulled out of the country and handed off security to Afghans. The US and NATO retreated into a training and advising role.

""A complete withdrawal of U.S. forces would very likely cause the Taliban to make gains in key areas throughout Afghanistan,"" Roggio said. ""This likely would cause the general collapse of the (Afghan National Security and Defense Force) as a cohesive fighting force and lead to the return of the warlords.""

US President Donald Trump considers the war in Afghanistan a lost cause and has long pushed to pull the troops out. His decision was made public a mere few hours after he abruptly announced the US was withdrawing troops from Syria.

Trump's state of mind is sure to have given a sense of urgency to US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been working to reach a negotiated end to America's longest war and has been pushing for a deal by April.

In an interview with Afghanistan's TOLO TV on Thursday hours before the withdrawal plans were announced he noted Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to end the Afghan war, which has already cost Americans nearly USD 1 trillion. More than 2,400 American soldiers have also died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.

""There was little doubt that Amb. Khalilzad was always working with limited time and a zeal of desperation to achieve something before the president pulled the plug,"" said Daniel Markey, senior research professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

A Taliban official told The Associated Press the announcement was a positive step.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, the official said Taliban officials think the promised departure could help the peace process because it could ""lead to trust building that the US wants a political solution.""

The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since their ouster in 2001, controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.

Several high ranking Afghan military officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the morale of Afghanistan's undertrained and poorly equipped security forces was already at a dangerously low ebb. The troops routinely complain about reinforcements that arrive too late, equipment that fails and even running out of food.

The officials called America's withdrawal a defeat, comparing it to the U.S.'s evacuation from Vietnam, and Russia's 1979 forced withdrawal from Afghanistan that capped a failed 10-year campaign.

US troops invaded Afghanistan in November 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 attacks.

Their ouster of the Taliban returned to power former warlords, whose bitter infighting and runaway corruption had resulted in vast tracts of the capital Kabul being destroyed and given rise to the Taliban, who used a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam to restore calm to the country.

Ordinary Afghans have mixed feelings about the presence of US and NATO troops.

Many fear their departure believing it will strengthen the Taliban, yet criticize their presence for doing little to improve security, which has deteriorated. Afghans complain bitterly about their deeply corrupt government and see the US which largely bankrolls the government as responsible.

Neighbour Pakistan, who has been harshly criticized by Trump for not doing enough to bring the Taliban to the table, had warned that a sudden departure of U.S. troops would result in chaos in Afghanistan and destabilize the region.

""The last thing it (Pakistan) wants is a radical Islamist state on its Western border, even if that eliminates or reduces Indian influence in Afghanistan,"" said Shuja Nawaz, author and fellow at the Atlantic Council's South Asia Center.

Like an imminent surgery, an election has a way of crowding out all thoughts from the mind and turning the focus of politicians to populism and free giveaways, forgetting the difficult job of economic and governance reform. The results of the latest state elections have reminded us that Indians are by nature sceptical and not shy to change their leaders. The grand certainties of 2014 have suddenly become the grand doubts of 2019.

From earliest times, the Indian temper has been comfortable with uncertainty, beginning with ambiguity over how the cosmos was born in the famous Nasadiya verse in the Rig Veda and the doubting neti, neti ('not this, not that') method of Advaita. I believe our questioning nature is a strength in building citizenship and democracy. Unfortunately, our educational system, instead of nourishing inquiry, does everything possible to kill it through a rote learning system. The ascendance of technology, engineering and 'useful subjects' has displaced the old-style liberal education that promoted inquisitiveness. A few excellent private liberal arts and sciences institutions are coming up, and they offer some hope for the future. Most of the older ones have faded into mediocrity.

In these times when 'liberal' has acquired a bad odour, it is worth reminding ourselves that it shares a root with 'liberty'. Liberal education is a method of learning rather than mastery of specific content, teaching one to reason and providing the confidence to judge for oneself. A liberal education befits a free human being, one who is capable of governing himself and participating in collective self-government. This ability translates at election time in distinguishing a charlatan from a sensible and sincere candidate. In the recent elections, it would have exposed the disastrous idea of farm loan waivers which rewards defaulters and punishes honest farmers, aside from bankrupting the states' treasuries, leaving no money for real agricultural reform.

If a liberal education is not only about book learning but an approach to learning, any subject - even manual labour - could be part of the curriculum, and help shrink some of our caste prejudice against working with our hands. When we study something for its own sake, it reinforces our early curiosity as children and builds upon our civilisation's ancient sceptical temper. Indeed, an interrogation of the Upanishads and the epics with a modern mind can be as valuable as reading Homer, Shakespeare and Marx.

A liberal education can also help to raise the tone of our political discourse that has plunged to great depths in recent years. All parties were responsible for the shameful lack of civility in the recent elections. Rahul Gandhi contributed to it with his persistent 'chowkidar chor hai' with regard to the Rafale fighter deal. He did not censure his functionaries who made obnoxious remarks about Modi's mother's age or cast aspersions on his father. It is to Rahul's credit that he apologised for a former minister's insulting reference to Modi's occupational caste. Earlier references to 'maut ka saudagar' by Sonia Gandhi were equally 'uncivil'.

BJP is no better. Modi has been guilty of uncivil language about the dynasty. A Gujarat minister falsely accused the late Verghese Kurien of diverting funds from Amul to Christian missionaries. Modi did not repudiate this aspersion on a bureaucrat who has made India the world's largest milk producer. All parties, especially AAP and Shiv Sena repeatedly abuse opponents - for example, ""son of Khilji"" is a sickening reference to Rahul's foreign origins.

A liberal education is beneficial in cultivating the habit of respectful engagement in a community, dedicated to finding workable answers rather than resorting to insulting innuendos about the ethnic identity of opponents. It also leads generally to a centrist position in politics, eschewing the extreme right and left. The political centre is accommodative, tends to harmonise social and cultural contradictions and appeals to the average voter, especially the minorities. Hence, most elections in India since Independence have been won by moderate candidates. Even the Modi wave in 2014 was the result of Modi adopting a centrist promise of vikas and jobs, which attracted the aspirational, young voter. It is quite another matter that the promise has not been fulfilled and Modi is a worried man today.

Finally, approaching education in a liberal manner can also make us better human beings. By freeing us from the demands of getting a job and making a living, it offers the freedom to reflect upon existential questions of who we are and why we are here. It turns our attention away from ourselves to our place in the world, making us see that we are part of something larger than ourselves. This 'self-forgetting' is always good for building character. When combined with action and experience, it leads to prudence (phronesis) as Aristotle suggested - to do the right thing to the right person, at the right time, in the right manner, and for the right reason.

But how can a poor or middle class Indian family afford the luxury of not preparing its children for a job? Surely, a four-year undergraduate American liberal education is a luxury that most Indians cannot afford. Indeed it can, if you view liberal education not as content but as an approach to learning; it should begin in primary school and go right through postgraduate education. Liberal education is not an end but a means to prepare a young person to become a thoughtful member of society. It does not exist in isolation from making a living or becoming a good citizen. It merely reminds us that there is more to life than consumption and production."

The announcement seems certain to complicate efforts to reach a peace deal, mostly because it gives the Taliban leverage by allowing them to hold off until a total US withdrawal, or step up their demands over a weakened Afghan government.

""I believe the Taliban will see this as a reason to stall, and therefore it disincentivizes the Taliban to actually talk to the Afghan government, which it has refused to do,"" said Bill Roggio an Afghanistan analyst with the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies.

Afghanistan's security forces rely heavily on US airpower against both Taliban and an upstart Islamic State affiliate, and Afghan military officials note the announcement by the Trump administration comes as the country's security is at its worst since 2014, when more than 100,000 NATO troops pulled out of the country and handed off security to Afghans. The US and NATO retreated into a training and advising role.

""A complete withdrawal of U.S. forces would very likely cause the Taliban to make gains in key areas throughout Afghanistan,"" Roggio said. ""This likely would cause the general collapse of the (Afghan National Security and Defense Force) as a cohesive fighting force and lead to the return of the warlords.""

US President Donald Trump considers the war in Afghanistan a lost cause and has long pushed to pull the troops out. His decision was made public a mere few hours after he abruptly announced the US was withdrawing troops from Syria.

Trump's state of mind is sure to have given a sense of urgency to US peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has been working to reach a negotiated end to America's longest war and has been pushing for a deal by April.

In an interview with Afghanistan's TOLO TV on Thursday -- hours before the withdrawal plans were announced -- he noted Trump had campaigned for president on a promise to end the Afghan war, which has already cost Americans nearly USD 1 trillion. More than 2,400 American soldiers have also died in Afghanistan since the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.

""There was little doubt that Amb. Khalilzad was always working with limited time and a zeal of desperation to achieve something before the president pulled the plug,"" said Daniel Markey, senior research professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.

A Taliban official told The Associated Press the announcement was a positive step.

Speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, the official said Taliban officials think the promised departure could help the peace process because it could ""lead to trust building that the US wants a political solution.""

But there was no sign the Taliban were ready to move on the two major sticking points: Direct talks with the Afghan government and a cease fire while the two sides negotiate Khalilzad's so-called ""roadmap for the future of Afghanistan.""

Peace talks aside, the announced withdrawal has Afghan generals and analysts worried about the ability of the beleaguered Afghan National Afghan Security Force to stave off a Taliban insurgency unfettered by U.S. troops and their pounding air power.

The Taliban are already stronger today than they have been since their ouster in 2001, controlling or holding sway over nearly half the country.

Several high ranking Afghan military officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified because they were not authorized to speak to the media, said the morale of Afghanistan's undertrained and poorly equipped security forces was already at a dangerously low ebb. The troops routinely complain about reinforcements that arrive too late, equipment that fails and even running out of food.

The officials called America's withdrawal a defeat, comparing it to the U.S.'s evacuation from Vietnam, and Russia's 1979 forced withdrawal from Afghanistan that capped a failed 10-year campaign.

US troops invaded Afghanistan in November 2001 in response to the Sept. 11 attacks.

Their ouster of the Taliban returned to power former warlords, whose bitter infighting and runaway corruption had resulted in vast tracts of the capital Kabul being destroyed and given rise to the Taliban, who used a strict and harsh interpretation of Islam to restore calm to the country.

Ordinary Afghans have mixed feelings about the presence of US and NATO troops.

Many fear their departure believing it will strengthen the Taliban, yet criticize their presence for doing little to improve security, which has deteriorated. Afghans complain bitterly about their deeply corrupt government and see the US -- which largely bankrolls the government -- as responsible.

Neighbour Pakistan, who has been harshly criticized by Trump for not doing enough to bring the Taliban to the table, had warned that a sudden departure of U.S. troops would result in chaos in Afghanistan and destabilize the region.

The chosen venues where the mock drill was conducted were Udalguri Hospital, Aspire Junior College, Deputy Commissioner's Office, Indian Shopping Mart and Officers' Colony. As for the Relief Camp on the occasion, Bagoriguri LP School was chosen. After the siren started wailing, all the officers assembled at the District Emergency Operation Centre (DOEC).

After the earthquake was simulated, the Incident Response Team collected information about the devastated areas and the incharge officers proceeded to the staging area which was created in the parade ground from where the NDRF, Indian Army, Fire & Emergency Service, Civil Defence and Home Guards were instructed to take their positions.

The rescue teams then proceeded to the specific areas where 'devastation' took place. The volunteer patients were also transported by ambulances to the district hospital. The doctors and nurses also proceeded to their pre-fixed destinations during the mock drill.

It may be mentioned here that officers of different departments were entrusted with multiple functions during the mock operation. After completion of the entire drill, the District Magistrate noted down the shortcomings and problems faced during such a natural calamity and presented it during the video conference titled, 'Hot Wash'.

IN Biswanath Chariali: Along with the rest of the state, the District Disaster Management Authority in collaboration with ASDMA and NDMA conducted a surprise mega mock drill on earthquake yesterday at four different venues simultaneously in and around Biswanath Chariali town.

The four pre-designated places included City Hub, Municipal Office Complex, Nityananda Complex, Kochgaon and Biswanath Chariali Civil Hospital.

From 10 am, personnel of NDRF's 12th Battalion, SDRF, Assam Rifles, CRPF, SSB, F&ES took part in the demonstrative rescue operation. The various rescue teams consisting of more than 70 members from the forces successfully evacuated 40 mock victims hailing from NCC, NSS and Biswanath College Union Body. All injured person were shifted to the designated hospital, i.e. Biswanath Chariali Civil Hospital where specialised doctors' teams provided medical care to the mock patients.

A special observer from NDRF's 12th Battalion monitored the entire exercise and shared his views on the scenarios created.

IN Tezpur: The mock drill on earthquake disaster was held yesterday and conducted jointly by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) in coordination with Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).

A post earthquake-like scenario was simulated at 10 am and on receipt of the information, the Responsible Office (DC) activated the Incident Response System (IRS) and all members of the district Incident Response Team (IRT) assembled at the District Emergency Operations System (DEOC).

Of the four venues selected for the exercise, a scenario of building collapse was recreated at the LGBRI of Mental Health, while a fire at the District Treasury Office, a stampede at the District Library due to a large congregation of people and a scenario of chaos and injury at NC Hotel was recreated for the purpose of the mock exercise.

All rescue and relief teams were mobilised from the 'staging area' at the Church Field and deployed for rescue and relief operations. Ambulances and fire-tenders were mobilised as per requirement. Response teams from police, civil defence, SDRF/ fire services, Army and SSB were engaged for rescue and evacuation operations.

Traffic was regulated and police personnel deployed for law and order. A 'hot wash' or review was also conducted via video conference later in the day.

A table top exercise in this connection was held via video conference with all the concerned deputy commissioners on December 19 where all notified members of the Incident Response Team (IRT) of each district took part.

IN Haflong: The District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in association with the National Disaster Management Authority and Assam State Disaster Management Authority conducted a mega mock drill in Haflong along with the cooperation of police, defence personnel, fire fighters and all other line departments and volunteers yesterday.

Prior to the mock exercise, a table top exercise was also conducted on December 19 with an objective to review the disaster management plan along with identifying gaps and to enhance coordination among the stakeholders and responding agencies following the principle of Incident Response System (IRS) at state and district level.

The mock drill was simultaneously performed at five different locations like Deputy Commissioner's office, Waimijing Club building, Girls' Higher Secondary School, Don Bosco Higher Secondary School and Haflong Civil Hospital/Holy Spirit Hospital.

As a part of the mock exercise, different situations were simulated such as setting up of staging area, incident base, District Emergency Operation Centre (DEOC), incident command post, rescue operation team, medical, logistic, media and information etc.

As many as 150 participants, including officials from various departments, Army, CRPF and police personnel, school students, teachers, NGOs and clubs performed the mock drill with full enthusiasm and coordination.

It may be noted that such mega mock drill to check earthquake preparedness was conducted in Dima Hasao and the entire state for the first time.

ANN Service adds:

IN SONARI: Mock drill was organised yesterday under the auspices of the Charaideo district administration at the Deputy Commissioner's office, Sonari Municipal Board, Saint Joseph's School, Urban Health Centre and public field.

Personnel from the Army, CRPF, Assam Police, NDRF, ONGC, PHE, Fire Department, Health, ASEB etc., participated in the drill where the local public evinced positive response.

How to save life and property during fire, earthquake and other emergency situations were exhibited through mock drill for the first time in the district. On conclusion of the drill, an awareness meet was held at the public playground. Vivekananda Phukon, Deputy Commissioner of Charaideo district, additional deputy commissioners Jitu Kumar Das, Pranab Bora and Dipak Kumar Bhuiya, besides Jayanta Mout, SDPRO incharge of Charaideo were also present on the occasion."
"314","1024173050","2018-12-21","http://mydigitalfc.com/fc-weekend/science-cooking","Science of cooking","mydigitalfc.com",FALSE,"You may call it food science or a fad. But molecular gastronomy is the in-thing in the world of fine dine culinary.

As they say, there are many branches of food science that study different aspects of food: safety, microbiology, preservation, chemistry, engineering and physics. Till molecular gastronomy came along, there was no branch dedicated to studying the chemical processes of cooking at home and in restaurants although it all existed in some form or other.

Food science has primarily been concerned with industrial food production and, while the disciplines may overlap, they are considered separate areas of investigation.

The creation of molecular gastronomy was intended to bring together what had previously been fragmented and isolated investigations into the chemical and physical processes of cooking into an organised discipline within food science, to address what the other disciplines within food science either do not cover, or cover in a manner intended for scientists rather than cooks, claim experts.

The term ""molecular and physical gastronomy"" was coined way back in 1988 by Hungarian physicist Nicholas Kurti and French physical chemist Hervé This. In 1992, it became the title for a set of workshops held in Italy's Erice, where scientists and professional cooks came together for a discussion on the science behind traditional cooking preparations. Eventually, the term ""molecular gastronomy"" became the name of the approach, based on exploring the science behind traditional cooking methods.

According to Sous Chef Vikram Bisht at Taj Gateway Resort, Damdama, molecular gastronomy is a science-based concept of cooking. According to the technical term, it is an art of cooking that involves a combination of physics and chemistry. Nowadays, a lot of hotels, institutes and restaurants in India are exploring it.

Demand

The demand has started picking up slowly, he says. While its popularity hasn't shown the highest momentum, chefs today have started to incorporate these techniques into their cooking and experiment with ingredients. Moreover, curating food is interesting as minute details are covered as one resorts to a scientific way of cooking food, says Bisht, adding: ""At Taj Damdama, our complimentary gastronomy cooking has been a great delight. Dishes like veg caviar that cannot be made with non-veg items, have been experimented with molecular gastronomy.""

The fact that eminent restaurateur Zorawar Kalra has upended all notions of traditional Indian cuisine is nothing new. One can credit him with introducing foams, spheres, gels and liquid nitrogen -- all hallmarks of molecular gastronomy.

Of late, he has been dabbling with all things connected with molecular techniques, yet go much beyond it. It's a combination of culinary methods some of which are ancient and others are way ahead of their time. For instance, the pickling of karela that takes 15 to 20 days, is evocative of cooking methods of yore, while the lip-smacking chocolate dessert is done by supercharging a magnet and having it quantum-locked in space.

""It is pure gastronomy now,"" says Kalra. ""We have gone past molecular gastronomy some 4-5 years ago. There are new technologies that have come in along with old conserving methods like fermenting food through pickling etc. These days we use homogenisers for cocktails so that food safety is protected and nothing is touched,"" Kalra explains.

For him the millennials are the major customers who eat out four-to-five times a week. The Indian market is about to grow at 20 per cent. ""It is already seeing an 18 per cent growth,"" he says.

His company, Massive Restaurants, clocked an FY18 revenue of Rs 220 crore, a 30 per cent growth over the previous year.

'Molecular Magician' and top Chef Bakshish Dean who has been studying this subject since 2002, says he was lucky to have had very supportive bosses who gave him all the liberty to experiment and put out dishes on the menu which had been enhanced using this wonderful science.

The top chef of the country who has been awarded the title of 'Molecular Magician,' is a maverick in the world of gastronomy. He is the man behind 'Johny Rockets' coming to India and he is also 'the man' behind the conceptual Cha-Bar in Delhi.

While people like Chef Bakshish and Chef Abhijit Saha have been the pioneers in the field in India, the concept got mass recognition only recently.

Innovative

According to Chef Bisht, chefs these days are thinking innovatively and re-visiting everything that did not make sense in the kitchen earlier. The availability of niche ingredients in India that help curate meals are much more innovative and keep up with global trends. ""The interest in science, the precedence given to it and the desire to question culinary art has now been more than ever,"" he says.

For Chef Mohib Farooqui, associate director, Culinary Arts at Indian School of Hospitality, anything and everything from boiling an egg is molecular gastronomy because it's the chemical and physical reaction that has led to the whole process. He too claims to be among the fortunate few to have started working in the area as early as 2005 when he was in Australia.

""In India it all got promoted in 2009 by pioneers like Chef Abhijit Saha in Bangalore and Chef Bakshish Dean in Delhi,"" he recalls.

It's a fussy thing, he says, adding how everybody those days was involved in spherification.

Spherification is kitchen alchemy, a technique that enables you to imbue a flavourful liquid with the appearance of being solid, an illusion that's broken when the spheres burst with flavour as they're eaten.

The idea of exploiting spherification-like techniques for food production was first patented in Britain in 1942 by William Peschardt, a food scientist working for the firm Unilever. Since then, the technique -- using ions to trigger a gelling process -- has found a variety of uses in the food industry.

It was Sergi Estragues and Joachim Vives, representatives of a Spanish food company, who initially demonstrated the technique to Ferran Adrià. He put it to far more creative and surprising uses at his restaurant - elBulli - one of the pioneers of molecular gastronomy those days.

'It's abolished completely today as it's a cliché thing and chefs are moving away from it,"" says Farooqui.

The term ""molecular gastronomy"" has often been misused. Everyone thinks some sublimation of smoke or dry ice is molecular gastronomy. That's not true, he argues.

Food technology has been using all these for a long time. Today, says Farooqui, anything new would be termed as molecular but in fact a more apt term would be to call it modernist cuisine.

Even making mayonese requires a modernist procedure.

While the concept of molecular gastronomy is exciting and revolutionary in the world of culinary art, there are complex challenges that embrace this discipline as far as India is concerned.

Most of the ingredients used are imported, and very expensive be it Agar-Agar or China Grass as texture modifier. Agar-Agar is a jelly-like substance, obtained from red algae. Often used as an ingredient in desserts throughout Asia and also as a solid substrate to contain culture media for microbiological work, Agar-Agar can also be used as a laxative, an appetite suppressant, a vegetarian substitute for gelatin, a thickener for soups, in fruit preserves, ice-cream, and other desserts, as a clarifying agent in brewing, and for sizing paper and fabrics.

""These ingredients are difficult to procure and there is only one Mumbai-based company, Chenab Impex, that is importing products from Spain. Procurement is expensive,"" argues Farooqui.

Moreover, he says, homegenisers are beyond Rs10 lakh, which means restaurants have to spend that much and also get return on investment, which is difficult.""

Kalra points out how equipment is a big challenge. ""There are just five homogenisers in the whole of UK. You can well imagine the situation,"" he adds.

As Bisht puts it, the constraints around time, space, money will continue to persist, unless there is adequate investment in these areas. ""Also, one of the main troubles is that this methodology in cooking does not facilitate all kinds of dishes,"" he complains.

Chef Dean recalls, ""It definitely has proliferated from the time I started understanding and learning the subject but not to the extent that I would have loved to witness. I see a lot of young chefs and bar experts wanting to learn the subject but unfortunately because of the lack of subject experts they are grappling with it, so the learning curve is way too long. There is no school or institute that has taken the mantle of making this wonderful subject available to students and professionals from the trade. It's a wonderful subject that will lead to advancement in cuisine but is in a pretty sad state.""

Executive Chef Rajani Ranjan Rashmi of Sahara Star points out that liquid nitrogen is banned by FSSAI and hence despite a craze for gastronomy many people are going back to ancient techniques.

""Dry ice is not safe either. Molecular gastronomy may provide visual appeal with jalebi caviars etc but the major challenge is that most ingredients are not readily available. These have to be imported. Also there's little education on the subject in cooking schools,"" he says.

Acceptance

As for demand it is often created with acceptance and embracing the idea. ""Acceptability in India is slow due to lack of understanding. Otherwise it can push our cuisine towards pathbreaking development and once on that track, I do see a lot of demand,"" Chef Dean adds, saying, ""Little knowledge, they say, is dangerous but having no knowledge is like pushing yourself into reverse gear at a time when everyone is moving ahead. I sincerely hope we realise this soon and encourage our next generation to learn, master the subject and move forward.""

The future is a raging debate. This will stand or fall with its capability to exhibit whether it is a scientific discipline of relevance or just a sub-study under food science, say experts.

The merit of molecular gastronomy will be proven after it receives enough interest from the general public, says Bisht.

The world over, the concept is very successful as it is viewed as a development like in any other field and the subject is studied as a science and not discarded as a fashion, explains Chef Dean, adding, ""It empowers us to get deeper into the subject and take control of what we can do with food, islolate flavours, create textures, understand nutrition, enhance how we present and grow food. It empowers us to create diets which can assist in curing disease, look at alternates that one would never ever have considered, revive lost foods and much more.""

Food gastronomy is connected with food beverages and their genesis. Experimental cooking is an evolving style and this can be continually built upon by building on the knowledge base in kitchen studies.

""Our training institutes ensure progressive cooking is taught to our employees in the kitchen and we strive to bring in excellence and ideas together. Our guests love what we learn and plate up. We hope that as much as this concept is creating the buzz, we are able to sustain it over the years to come. Considering the immense scope around creating dishes that have flavour and meaning, this concept, if made to bloom, can be instrumental in creating stellar recipes in the kitchen,"" adds Chef Bisht."

Mr. Ansari, who had run away to Pakistan in 2012 to allegedly meet a female friend that he met on Facebook and was later arrested, reached his house on Thursday after spending six years behind bars in Pakistan. His building in Versova, despite efforts of his family to keep their celebrations low key, wore a look of jubilation and euphoria on Friday. While neighbours and relatives kept pouring in to meet him, Mr. Ansari spent most of the day gazing out of the window.

""When I left Mumbai, Samsung Galaxy S2 was a fad and roads were open and wide. The city is changing,"" he said in an exclusive interaction with The Hindu on Friday evening.

Now 33 years old, Mr. Ansari expressed regret at his decision six years ago and said he wants to bury all the unpleasant memories. ""I really regret having left everything behind and running there. I regretted that even when I was in Pakistan. I should have given it another thought. While on social media, we often forget that we do not know much about the person on the other end. Right from the beginning, one should be cautious of who they are interacting with,"" he said.

About his dark days in Pakistan, Mr. Ansari said happy memories from his childhood became his strength.

""I do not know why or in what context they occurred, but there was not a week when I did not have dreams of my school and friends from there. In isolation, miles away from the city, these dreams kept me going in every sense of the word,"" he said.

However, Mr. Ansari said he has no hatred whatsoever. ""We cannot ignore the fact that humanity is alive there also. Those who helped me, showered their kindness, fought for me while I was behind bars, were all Pakistanis. We all talk about treatment given there by the agencies, but they were doing their job. They stopped when they realised the truth,"" Mr. Ansari said.

He said, ""Instead of scratching old wounds and harbouring hatred, it is better to slowly let them go. I am back home, but there are many who need to be repatriated too. My brothers and sisters are there. I know what they are going through and the pain of their families.""

Back in Mumbai, Mr. Ansari now has one goal: to find a job and resume from where he had left his career six years ago. While settling in life continues to be his priority, nothing, he said, is more important than finding a job. ""My family has done a lot for me. I now want them to sit back and relax and let me do my best for them.""

An avid learner, Mr. Ansari was working as a teacher with a hotel management institute in Mumbai, and wishes to go back to the profession. ""The crucial period of my career building has gone by in jail, but I will not lose hope. It was hope that kept me going in Pakistan; I will ensure that that hope never ever perishes,"" he said."

A new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. (Mohit Suneja/HT)

To the world, Manish Sarki was the perfect all-rounder.

A strapping boy of 18, Sarki worked hard in school during the day and sent fielders scurrying after his shots at the neighbourhood cricket ground in the evenings. He would never get home later than dinner time even when his friends were out chatting, his mother Chandra Maya remembers, and his closest friends joked about how he would blush talking to girls.

Everyone in the village of St Mary's Hill knew Sarki would grow up to be a policeman or join the army. Maybe because he was so well-behaved, no one noticed when he went quiet. They only noticed on the night of August 20 when he didn't come back home.

The village gathered around the Sarki house around 9pm. A chill was enveloping the small mountain village on the outskirts of Darjeeling in northern Bengal, but a small group of men and women trekked to the local police station a couple of kilometers away. Boys go missing all the time, they were told.

Undeterred, the villagers split into smaller search parties and fanned out into the jungles, determined to find Sarki. Their hopes were dashed around 1.30am when a search team stumbled on Sarki's body hanging from the ceiling of an empty pig warehouse on top of a hill.

Below, in spray paint, were the words ""half blood prince was here"" in what everyone recognised was Sarki's handwriting. On the wall behind was drawn a hangman with two victims, an older boy, and more chillingly, a younger one. Every wall of the building had been scribbled on - the words ""illuminati"", ""last king"", ""savage"", ""doped up"" and the number ""666"" appearing repeatedly.

In the light of day, some of the graffiti might have appeared benign - after all, some the walls displayed banalities like ""be the change you want to see"" or ""the thing you fear the most is fear itself"". But in the eerie quiet of a cold mountain night, the villagers were convinced Sarki's death was the doing of the satan. ""I was heartbroken for my son but also scared out of my wits. We were all scared about who the younger boy could be,"" said Chandra Maya.

By the time police arrived two hours later, a mist of rumours had cloaked the village. Wasn't Sarki always on his phone for the past few weeks? And, wouldn't he go out to the graveyard, barely a kilometer away, every night with his phone? ""I think he was going crazy. That's when I heard about the game,"" added Chandra Maya.

By sunrise, everyone had heard of the game: a shadowy application called the Momo Challenge that had apparently killed Sarki. Several explanations were offered. ""For the past few days, he was very sad and distracted. He would be lost in his phone. He never said anything to me, later I found out that he was playing the Momo game,"" said Sarki's friend Deekchen.

But how did he find out? Villagers say the local police first told them of the game, but the police deny ever saying anything. ""In fact, we have not been able to confirm any role of any Momo Challenge game. We never told the locals about the game. Maybe the graffiti made them think that,"" said Hare Krishna Pai, additional superintendent of police.

'HI, I AM MOMO. LET US PLAY A GAME'

The next day, a second death, that of 26-year-old Aditi Goyal in Kurseong town, was also attributed to the Momo Challenge, turning the creeping fear into full-blown panic. By then, local politicians had put out statements about the supposedly lethal game, and everyone in the hills was talking about it.

""The whole area was in trauma and everyone was scared of their phones. We found young boys from Class 7 had started playing it. We started spreading awareness and seized phones from those who seemed vulnerable. Someone even sent a message to my daughter,"" said Raju Gurung, a local from Kurseong.

Hindustan Times spoke to at least 20 people in the area and everyone claimed to know a relative, friend or neighbour who had had a close shave with the game. But everyone had a different notion.

Some described the game, which supposedly sets self-harm challenges that finally end in suicide, as an app, some as a Whatsapp message. Some said they received texts, some described a phone number. Indeed, beyond the ubiquitous image of the oblong faced, bulbous eyed doll that has come to signify the game, every detail was foggy. ""Sometimes people are faking names and photos and sending messages 'Hi, I am momo. Let us play a game.' The fear of the game has hypnotised us,"" said Junita Rana, a schoolteacher in Kurseong.

AN EPIDEMIC OF FEAR

It began with the braids. In June last year, a girl in Rajasthan claimed someone chopped off her braid while she was asleep. Dozens of women across Rajasthan followed up with similar claims. Over the following months, the pattern spread across north India like an epidemic: Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, Delhi. By November, over 200 cases of braid chopping had been reported in Kashmir where the trend took its most vicious turn. Many women claimed to have seen Godmen, witches or cats before losing their consciousness. After finding their braids gone, many complained of aches and pains for days after. The police couldn't really find any culprits, so the people took the matter in their hands. In August, a poor woman was killed by a mob in Agra on the suspicion of chopping braids. In October, an old man in Anantnag was killed for the same reason.

Then there was the Blue Whale. In July, a schoolboy's suicide stoked the hysteria around the web-based game created by a Russian tech geek targeting teengers. The 50 challenges begin differently-- from shutting yourself in or watching a horror film-- proceed incrementally, and end the same way: suicide. Through 2017, more than 150 cases of young suicides across India -- West Bengal, Delhi, Indore, Solapur, Dehradun-- were blamed on the Blue Whale, often with no more proof that the young person was obsessed with smartphone and videogames. Every case was rife was contradictions and yet, websites were blocked, advisories issued, and in some cases, smartphones banned in schools.

FACE-RIPPERS AND VAMPIRES

Experts say that underneath the web-fuelled hysteria, something more sinister is going on with the mental health of young people. Samir Parikh, director of the Department of Mental Health and Behavioural Sciences at Fortis Healthcare, insisted that we cannot dismiss these phenomena, but the focus should be on greater media literacy, on making children understand what is right and wrong content, and on teaching people to seek help if they are feeling vulnerable.

""Is there a component of hysteria in all this? Of course, there are lots of stories in the media and they have an impact. But we cannot deny the fact that there are pressures and problems that young people go through silently. If help and access is not given, they can be misused,"" he added.

Parikh is clear that any approach that aims at shutting down access to the internet is wrong, mainly because it is impossible. ""We need to understand that be it Blue Whale or Momo, if you are vulnerable, you might be pulled towards it. So you give people skills and teach people to not bottle it up, tell parents, block or involve authorities.""

India has had a long history of public panic. From a half-man half-monkey roaming the streets in Delhi, sometimes wearing a helmet, to the Munhnochwa (face ripper) of Mirzapur, claimed to be a flying object emitting beams of green or red light, sending shock waves through anyone who came in its contact, and leaving them with bites and scratches on their faces, to the Rathakaatteri (vampire) of Gundalpatti who allegedly sucked the blood of the village cattle, a new panic seizes the public imagination every few years. Many of these have been analysed as incidents of mass hysteria. The patterns have been revealing. Women are more likely to end up as victims than men, children turn to be more vulnerable than adults. The trends pick up in regions or communities marked by oppression of women, economic uncertainty or social anxiety.

Yet, questions remain about why a particular fear grips a set of people at a given time. Did every woman who complained of braid chopping do it herself? Was every alleged case of Blue Whale suicide made up by the parents or the police to evade responsibility? What do the women whose braids were chopped say now? And, did a year of fear and panic leave us any wiser?

LOSING BRAIDS, EARNING REST

In Kanganhedi, a village of 700 houses on the Delhi-Haryana border, Munesh Devi's hair has grown back just enough to tie it in a ponytail. A lot more has changed in her life since last year besides her hairstyle. ""I can no longer work in our field. I hardly leave the house, except being taken to the doctor by my son every two weeks. Any exertion leaves me tired. Even going to funerals gets up my blood pressure. I lie in bed almost all day. Daughters-in-law press my feet.They also bring me rotis to eat in bed,"" said Devi, sitting on a double bed in the living room. Its doors remain shut and its light dimmed to prevent Devi's recurring headache.

They began in July 2017, immediately after she found her braid chopped at the neck. It was there when she finished feeding the cows in the family's farm, she said, but gone when she got back home and slipped back her pallu. ""Must have gone missing while I was travelling home on the back of my son's motorcycle,"" she added. She remembers fainting after the realisation struck. She continues to feel giddy. ""My head spins. My whole body aches. My feet go numb. My teeth hurt."" She doesn't know what ails her; neither does her doctor. He prescribes her pills for each of her symptoms. She shows off the stash to people asking her how she has been doing since ""the incident.""

Munesh Devi's was one of three braids found missing in the area in the course of one eventful day. The other two women don't know, either, who chopped their braids or why they continue to suffer. Sri Devi said she lost her braid while sitting on a couch in the courtyard of her house. One moment it was hanging down her waist, the next moment it was lying on the floor. She had heard of the braid-chopping phenomenon only hours before. ""My uncle, who was visiting us from Pataudi, had told me about a video he had seen on Facebook. I said, 'Mama, please don't say such things.'"" Her son had called 100 after she fainted at the sight of her severed braid. ""The police are yet to tell us if they found anything,"" she said.

Devi also visited a psychiatrist in Dwarka along with her son, at the urging of the police. ""He asked my son some questions. Gave us no answers,"" she said. Her braid was taken away by a forensics team sent in by the police for further investigations. ""We haven't heard from them."" Perturbed by three incidents in a week, people in the village even consulted a tantrik (mystic). ""He spoke about the presence of a mysterious cat in the village. But no such cat or dog has been found,"" she said.

For many women, the disappearance of braids has been transformative. It has allowed them rightful rest after a lifetime's slog at home and farm, won them the nurturing attention of their families, and given them the chance to talk about themselves for the first time. The third ""victim"" in Kangnahedi, Ombati, a daily-wage labourer who found her braid gone while working around the house, is still waiting for her life to change, however. ""No government compensation, no one has even come to offer me a glass of juice,"" she said, lying on a cot and complaining of a headache.

""We sent a team to that village for a couple of hours after a request from the concerned division of the Delhi police, but we haven't received any formal communication from the top brass,"" explained Nimesh Desai, director of the Institute of Human Behaviour and Allied Sciences, which had investigated the phenomenon of Delhi's Monkey-man in 2001. ""From the preliminary impressions of our team, in all probability, the incidents in Kanganhedi fit into the pattern of mass hysteria, which tends to subside on its own.""

MASKED MEN OR MAIDS?

In Kashmir, the last region to be swept up in the storm, over 100 FIRs were registered over six months. Many women alleged masked men entered their homes when they were alone, sprinkled sedatives in the air, and chopped their braids while they lay unconscious. Separatist leaders accused the Indian government, and armed militants suspected the evil hand of intelligence agencies. As locals flooded the streets in protest, shutting down shops and schools, the police resorted to extreme measures, from announcing an award of Rs 6 lakh for information to unleashing riot-control tactics to disperse the crowds. Several vigilante groups armed with lathis and axes emerged to patrol the streets at night. A 70-year-old man in Anantnag died after being hit by a brick by a group of people who suspected him to be a braid chopper.

But now, police say the paranoia and panic was fuelled by nothing substantive.

""Almost all the cases turned out to be without any substance. There were a few cases where the women had cut their hair themselves. In one case, a maid had cut the hair of a girl,"" said additional director general of police (law and order), Muneer Khan. In Kulgam, where 21 cases had been registered, the state government had formed a special investigation team(SIT). Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP), Kulgam, Aijaz Ahmad, who was part of the SIT, said that most of the cases have been closed because the allegations had no factual basis.

""In some of the cases, the culprits remain untraced, while maximum cases turned out to be of hysteria,"" Ahmad said. He said the lack of a single eyewitness in all of the cases was particularly baffling.

Across the valley, the police arrested between 70 and 80 people, including members of vigilante groups, for ""raising false alarm about braid chopping and creating disturbances"".

""We felt that this [braid chopping] was being done by agencies. It was a matter of honour of our women. Everybody wanted this should end. Stone pelting was the only option with us. Surprisingly it did end abruptly after that,"" said a villager from north Kashmir who requested anonymity. Some of them are still visiting the courts for hearings.

BLUE WHALES AND PHONE BANS

It was around 5pm on July 29 last year when Manpreet Singh Sahani climbed on the ledge of his fifth-floor apartment. As he teetered on the edge, neighbours and witnesses on the street below called out to him but could only watch helplessly as he jumped. Initial investigations by local police and testimonies of his friends exposed talk of the Blue Whale Challenge. Several of them took to social media to blame the game and link it to Sahani's death.

In 24 hours, reports of the supposedly lethal game had inundated media, and reports of copycat cases were streaming in from all parts of India, ratcheting up paranoia about mobile phone and internet use among teenagers and their parents. Over the next two months, more than 150 deaths or injuries across the country were alleged to be linked to the game.

But while police initially suspected the boy was an avid gamer and could have been influenced by the Blue Whale Challenge, detailed investigation indicated more offline triggers.

""The boy was in love with a girl who had left him for some other boy. We had gone through his email accounts and mobile phone and found a draft on the phone which clarified his intention to commit suicide,"" said Navin Reddy, deputy commissioner of police Zone 10.

This might not be an isolated phenomenon. Earlier this year, Union minister of state for home Hansraj Ahir told Lok Sabha that a committee formed under the chairmanship of the director general of the Computer Emergency Response Team-India (CERT-In) couldn't establish the involvement of the Blue Whale Challenge in any case.

""The committee analysed the internet activities, device activities, call records and other social media activity, other forensic evidences and also interacted with rescued victims associated with these incidents,"" the minister told the lower house.

Of course, by then several other central ministries, a number of state governments, the Central Board of Secondary Education and even the Supreme Court had got involved, with the apex court calling the game a ""national problem"".

But experts say official agencies may have jumped the gun. ""It was definitely a hoax. We need to shift focus from these voyeuristic things and to suicides, which is a big problem that kills a quarter of a million people. Some of these hoaxes have a life of their own because media makes them into a big story. We need long-term institutional solutions,"" said Soumitra Pathare, director of the Centre for Mental Health Law and Policy.

THE BIGGEST TRAGEDY

Back in St Mary's hill, Chandra Maya Sarki has gone back to her old routine -- wake up at the crack of dawn to draw water, fix food for her husband before he leaves for his daily wage work, and then clean their small wooden house. She likes to keep the television on and stray dialogues from the afternoon soaps animate the living room. She stares not at the screen, however, but at the the small framed photo of Sarki hanging on the blue wall, wondering why the mysterious admins of the Momo Challenge chose her child as their prey.

She doesn't know yet that the cyber cell of the West Bengal police has completed its forensic probe of his phone and found no trace of any Momo Challenge. ""If any application is downloaded, the forensic machine would find a trace, even if it is an unknown application. But we have found no such application, or any message on WhatsApp motivating people to play the game. We have found nothing so far,"" said a senior official of the cyber cell on the condition of anonymity.

She doesn't know that police has ruled out any links between the game and the death of Aditi Goyal and that at least two other cases in the state have been found to be hoaxes traced back to mischief makers sending scary messages through WhatsApp. She doesn't know that Sarki's teacher Sarita Sharma has a simple explanation for why he and his friends would go to the graveyard at night -- the mobile network was the best at that spot.

All she knows is that her beloved younger son will no longer come back home at 8pm every day. That she will never make him his favourite meal of dal-aloo and dum-eggs. The money she had been saving with her husband to send him to Bengaluru for higher studies now seems meaningless. Sometimes she talks to Sarki's sister, now in college, about him and the day that took him away from her. She will probably never know what really happened to Sarki or what troubled him enough to withdraw from his friends. Momo Challenge or not, that is the biggest tragedy of all.

The tiny habitation consisting just 13 mud-walled houses by Yanadi tribe on the bank of an irrigation channel here reminds the uniqueness in the old housing architecture and tastes of the rural folk of Andhra Pradesh.

Located on the outskirts of Vaadapalem hamlet in Machilipatnam mandal in the Krishna mangrove cover, built by wild crab hunters have every feature that was seen in any normal thatched house of yore in rural Andhra Pradesh.

More precisely, rural women of those generations were masters in building mud-walled houses, extensively using mud and cow dung. They are mostly built by the family members themselves, sometimes, with a helping hand from neighbour of the same tribe in erecting poles and laying the roof.

Eega Ramanamma's house is a model, meeting all the features of the mud-walled house - with three rooms including a hall, bedroom under one thatched roof. It has a separate fireplace made of mud and a kitchen meant both for cooking and storing grains and water. The motifs of various floral designs and birds are drawn on the floor with rice powder. They use chalk powder to draw the motifs on the walls.

""The life of the roof laid using grass procured from the river is at least five years while mud-walls sustain the same period. Cow dung is applied on the walls occasionally to maintain the smoothness"", Ms. Ramanamma told The Hindu, daughter of a crab hunter.

A majority of the houses have trees and flowering plants. Some houses have a bathroom that is covered with plastic bags, indicative of their hygiene awareness.

Other Yanadi tribal families said that they enjoy the fresh and unpolluted air on the bank of the irrigation channel and take the responsibility of maintaining the house.

Presently, the Yanadi families live in a pathetic condition, with no access to proper planned house and hygienic conditions in the rest of the Krishna district. Having a secured livelihood from crab hunting, the group of Yanadi families here has set an example by creating a healthy and sophisticated housing facility for them in comparison to their tribal cousins in the rest of the district.

Both men and women are engaged in crab hunting in the mangrove cover including the Krishna Wildlife Sanctuary.

The collected crabs are directly exported to Asian countries for consumption and cultivation in brackishwater ponds in Krishna district.

However, this tribal group is yet to realize the importance of education. Despite various serious attempts to bring the children back to school, parents still want their children to accompany them during crab hunting."
"318","1024126861","2018-12-21","https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/the-sinking-island-of-kerala/article25802177.ece","The sinking island of Kerala","The Hindu",FALSE,"Munroe Thuruthu, in Kollam district, is slowly going under water, and its fleeing residents join the swelling ranks of climate refugees. Navamy Sudhish reports on the mystery behind the 'sinking island' and what the future holds for the families who continue to live there

From a vantage point on the narrow ridge that meanders through Munroe Thuruthu in Kollam district, Kerala, you can see water seeping into the ragged edges of a house. Mould has invaded its walls. Its crumbling roof forms an eerie silhouette in the afternoon sun. Tall coconut stumps pierce a slate-grey sky. A canal spews dark slime. Despite all the water, the landscape is a picture of desolate barrenness. The 13.4 sq. km Munroe Thuruthu is an island that no longer holds any promises.

Thulasi, 42, still remembers the day, 20 years ago, when she came to Munroe as a bride. Back then, the island seemed like an idyll. Her small thatched house stood in the middle of coconut palms, on land filled with layers upon layers of silt. But today there is neither sand nor coconut trees. She lives in a ramshackle structure bursting at its seams. Water enters her house every day -- an unwelcome guest that leaves the walls damp and turns her yard into a brown pool of filth. She knows that her land is being reclaimed by water, and that the entire island will be wiped off the map soon. Yet, this is the future that awaits all residents of Munroe Thuruthu, a string of eight islets at the confluence of the Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada river. It cannot be easy waking up every day to the certainty that the place you call home is sinking.

In low-lying Pattamthuruthu, one of the islets in the island's mid-western part, the homes are a little more than rotting heaps. Salt residue sticks to their floors like fungi while saline water gnaws at the concrete. Says Thulasi: ""Water rushes inside during high tide and the strongest tides happen on full moon and no-moon days. You cannot flush your toilets when the flooding happens. When the water recedes, it stinks for hours.""

The home of Appukuttan, 40, and Sumangala, 36, is a fly-infested cesspool. The couple say there is no option to help them drain the flood water as they can't afford the clay -- priced at ₹1,000 per boat load -- that is needed to fill it. Says Sumangala, ""The flooding will continue till May. There are nights when you suddenly wake up sensing something is wrong and step into ankle-deep water."" Their house is surrounded by kambatti thickets, a variety of mangrove, that keeps the water in the nearby canal stagnant.

Like many others on the island, Sunil Kumar, Geetha and their two daughters, aged six and eight, have to wade through dirty water almost every day. Says Geetha, ""We know it's not hygienic for the children and they often get skin diseases. But we don't have any other way out.""

Her neighbour, Ponnappan, 68, says the recent floods have made the situation worse. He says: ""The water level has grown compared to previous years.""

Two islets in Munroe, which include Pattamthuruthu and Peringalam, do not have motorable roads. Connectivity is a major problem for the residents. The only higher secondary school on the island is in Peringalam. For students, getting to school can be an ordeal. Says Kalyani, 48, a resident, ""You have to walk on waterlogged roads and take a boat to the school. There are no vehicles."" When Thulasi's husband, Sathyan, fell ill, his neighbours had to carry him on a chair for nearly 2 km to the nearest road. ""Elders, pregnant women, and people with serious health issues suffer a lot. Recently, a girl delivered her baby on the road while on her way to the hospital,"" Kalyani adds.

In the past, most of the islanders were farmers. Today, the men take on odd jobs while the women look for earnings from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). The island also has a small number of fish farmers. Yet regardless of their occupation, they all share similar nightmares.

Lakshmikutty, 72, talks about how, in August this year, the pandal that was put up for her grandson's wedding got flooded. The family had to suddenly organise extra funds to book a wedding hall. Shobhana, a homemaker, adds that for many families, finding a good matrimonial alliance has become very difficult. ""Who would want to relocate to a stinking island with no basic facilities?"" she asks. The island, which lies barely 20 km from Kollam city, presents a stark contrast to the bustling business centre.

Not surprisingly, there has been a steady exodus from Munroe island, which currently has only 2,200 families, and is dotted with abandoned houses in varying stages of decay. Says Sathyan, 49, ""Our biggest problem is finding a buyer for our land. Many have just abandoned their home as it has become impossible to sell it.""

The island's decline began with the construction of the Thenmala dam. Located 70 km away and constructed in the 1960s under the Kallada Irrigation Project, the dam blocked the flow of fresh water as a result of sediments from the Kallada river -- the main determinant of the land's fertility. Today the whole area has turned saline.

Binu Karunakaran, president, Munroe Thuruthu panchayat, says, ""The threat of tidal surge became aggravated after the [Indian Ocean] tsunami in 2004. It also accelerated the whole sinking phenomenon. Earlier, it took decades for a building to deteriorate. Now it happens in a couple of years."" He spreads a map of the island on his desk and points to an island called Ekkappuram. ""Eight families used to live here,"" he says. ""Today, the whole island is completely under water.""

Munroe itself has been reporting a dip in population over the last few years. Says Karunakaran, ""The island currently has 9,800 residents. But it used to be over 15,000.""

According to a report prepared in 2016-17 by the Government Engineering College, Thrissur, the 2004 tsunami caused a sudden rise in the volume of building settlements, affecting the life of islanders. It says: ""Around 418 families are reported as affected. Many buildings in the area had settled down into the ground, ranging from a few centimetres to nearly half a metre (sic). The flood water during periods of high tide enter into the buildings and cause damage to the dwelling units. The premises of the houses are water-logged at times, causing problems for even entry/exit. A few residents have abandoned their dwelling units for safer locations.""

Karunakaran says that outward migration from the panchayat is the main reason for the decline in the island's population -- a demographic pattern that bucks the trend in the rest of the country. He says, ""As per the 2011 Census, the population growth rate for Munroe Thuruthu was minus 0.57%. In 2001 it was minus 0.36%. Parents often leave the place when their children relocate to other places. Hundreds of families have fled the island in the last few years.""

Another problem on the island is the scarcity of drinking water. During high tide, the public water supply system stops functioning and water has to be transported in canoes. V.K. Madhusoodan, a member of the environment committee of the Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad, says, ""Before the tsunami, there was tidal flooding in the island for only two months in a year. But now it happens eight months in a year."" Madhusoodaan, who also conducted a study on the sinking island, adds, ""The island can also be seen as the first casualty of global warming in Kerala, creating a band of environmental refugees.""

In the not too distant past, Munroe Thuruthu used to be a hub of coconut farming. Named after Colonel John Munroe, the British Resident of erstwhile Travancore State, the island was the main source of funding for the construction of CMS College in Kottayam during the pre-Independence era. But over the years, saline intrusion has stripped the soil of its fertility. Now the coconut trees on the island are mostly barren stumps. The local coir industry too collapsed due to a shortage of the raw material.

Many farmers then turned to the only remaining option: aquaculture. The last few years have seen the emergence of several fish farms. But the recent floods have wrecked the island's fragile ecological balance, and, once again, it is the farmers who have had to bear the brunt. H. Salim, Deputy Director of Fisheries in the Kerala government, says, ""The floods caused a sudden change in the physico-chemical parameters of the water, making it a less suitable environment for many species. Then the change in the salinity level led to the vanishing of plankton which, in turn, will affect fish production in future.""

While several studies have tried to pinpoint the reason for the island's steady sinking, none has come up with a fully satisfactory explanation. The National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS), based in Thiruvananthapuram, has been monitoring the island for the past one year. Says K.K. Ramachandran, Group Head, Atmospheric Processes, NCESS, ""The preliminary results of their investigations do not suggest that there is any rapid subsidence or 'sinking'. Structures on the island which have faulty foundations, of which there are many, have gone into this self-weight consolidation stage."" He adds, ""To reach any conclusion on ground subsidence, we should track ground measurements using GPS for a longer period of time. But flooding is another matter, and the low-lying reaches of the island are under serious threat.""

An NCESS study has found that the total water-holding capacity of Ashtamudi lake has decreased by 15% in the last 17 years. He says, ""Munroe's canal system is not properly maintained. A mesh of vegetation is blocking the waterways. So, once the astronomical tide from the Neendakara harbour [40 km away] reaches Ashtamudi, water gets trapped in the island.""

Global warming and climate change are also seen as the main forces driving the steady inundation. Ramachandran, however, says that climate change can only be one of the contributing factors. ""There is no denying the impending threat of sea-level rise. We have decoded that pattern. But that alone cannot cause such a geo-environmental condition,"" he points out.

""In Munroe,"" Ramachandran continues, ""there are areas that get inundated, but when we analyse the tides, we find that sometimes even the highest tide doesn't flood the island. We have also found a particular kind of internal resonance in the water body of Ashtamudi and currently we are researching that. Results from geophysical methods are expected to throw light on the sub-surface lithology and sediment layers. So the real reason behind the flooding is not the astronomical tide, but something else. We are hoping to figure it out within a year.""

Another major concern for the scientists is the evident sagging of the railway line cutting through the island. This is the same line from which, in July 1988, the Island Express fell into Ashtamudi lake, claiming 105 lives. Says Ramachandran, ""Nearly 100 trains pass through the line every day and the ground vibrations will affect a place like Munroe. If you go to the Munroturuttu railway station, you will see that the entire platform has come down almost to the level of tracks.""

The NCESS has also collected vertical core samples -- soil samples collected by digging deep -- from different parts of the island to study the sediment build-up. Adds Ramachandran, ""This island was partly built by the dumping of soil. So the sediment layers have become compressed over the years. That's why the buildings get slumped into the sediment layer, which means they are settling down and getting consolidated into the mud. The loosely laid sediment build-up cannot bear heavy structures and therefore we should adopt a construction method that is not so harsh on the terrain. We have to be very careful when it comes to new constructions.""

K.N. Balagopal, a former Member of Parliament from Kollam -- he drew national attention to Munroe's plight by raising it in Parliament, in 2015 -- believes that it is time to look for sustainable solutions. He says, ""I first noticed the issue when I visited the island in 2014 to assess rain damage. The farmers were facing a severe crisis, with nearly all their crops buried under water. But the flood pattern hinted at something other than the annual monsoon havoc and so I started observing the geographic and environmental changes on the island.""

After he raised the issue in Parliament, a Central delegation visited the island to study the problem. Says Balagopal: ""They went back after installing a tsunami warning system and nothing much came of it."" He feels that instead of branding the island as ""ecologically fragile"" and preparing for a mass evacuation, the State should adopt construction methods that suit the topography.

He adds: ""While looking for solutions, we discovered this concept of disaster-proof amphibious houses that can either be floating type or built on stilts. They use low-weight and water-resistant material and the units will have chemical toilets. At a later stage, we can focus on the possibilities of reviving agriculture and tapping the tourism potential of the place. The island can also be marketed as a model showcasing the terrifying consequences of global warming."" Funded by the Communist Party of India (Marxist), the first flood-proof house of Munroe is now nearing completion. Soon, the island will also flaunt the first amphibious building in India.

Nanma Gireesh, a postgraduate student of Translational Engineering, says, ""This is a structure that will rise whenever flooding occurs and settle back when the water recedes."" Gireesh, who is designing an amphibious structure on the island for the tourism department, adds, ""It will be the first such amphibious project in India. I finalised the design with the help of my guide, Suja R., after visiting the Netherlands and studying the patterns there.""

For its buoyant foundation, the construction method normally prescribes using recycled plastic barrels or bamboo/concrete pontoons as per site specifications. Says Gireesh, ""Under normal conditions, the structure stays on the ground. But when flooding happens, it rises over the level of water. It won't float away as it will be connected to four guidance posts whose heights can be customised."" Another highlight of the amphibious building is that it can be easily transported to another location as a single unit. ""It's not attached to the ground, and you don't even need to dismantle it in order to transport it,"" she adds.

At a workshop in February, at Munroe Thuruthu, organised by the State Wetland Authority Kerala (SWAK) and Directorate of Environment and Climate Change (DoECC), Kerala, many experts suggested that the entire island be divided into different zones based on vulnerability and that residents of only specific areas be rehabilitated in safer locations. While some parts of the island such as Patamthuruthu, are caught in the death throes, others such as Manakkadavu and Peringalam are seeing a revival in tourist inflow.

Says Karunakaran, ""We currently have 28 homestays, four service villas and two resorts. Shikara rides on the river are very popular. The tourists also enjoy travelling in country boats and canoes. Mangroves and migratory birds are another attraction. The District Tourism Promotion Council is operating a couple of special packages to the island.""

He adds, ""But instead of mindlessly fuelling the demand, we have decided to promote only responsible tourism in the area. Nothing that harms the environment will be allowed."""

Each of the 500 people invested in the creation of the restaurant for $1,000. The project is social: 80% of the profits will go to funding education, urban, cultural, environmental and other projects for the development of Kiev.

Non-random place

The building, which housed a Urban Space 500 belongs to the ""National suspine telerama"". It was built in 1937 by architect Joseph Karakis. Initially, there was a music school.

During the war the building was badly damaged but it was rebuilt in 1951 and opened in its walls, the TV and radio Center.

Biggest cities: Kyiv, Lviv, Kharkiv, Odessa, Dnepr, Zaporozhye, Krivoy Rog, Donetsk

Urban Space 500 took an area of 400 m2 on the ground floor. In the school six rooms, which were all named after streets and neighborhoods of the capital: ""Hem"" (meetings), ""Pechersk"", ""Borschagivka"", ""str"", ""Rusanivka"" and the input area ""Khreshchatyk"". To ""hem"" it is planned to conduct free lectures, presentations, musical performances and multidisciplinary events. The building also has a courtyard with a Park.

The interior of the restaurant used environmentally-friendly furniture is produced in Ukraine from wood and metal, natural fabrics and recycled chairs from IKEA, which appeared this summer.

Worked on the project with different contractors, but the final project was developed and implemented team Peker and Partners.

The concept

The idea and model Urban Space belongs to the framework of the ""Warm City"", which in 2014 opened a public restaurant Urban Space 100 in Ivano-Frankivsk. The project embody the Kiev public organization ""NSA Osvita"" management and restaurant company DRUZI Cafe & Bar.

At the Kiev restaurant 500 co-founders, among them - businessmen, public figures, restaurateurs, pros, artists and concerned citizens. 87% of them live in Kiev, 40% women, the average age of the co-owner of 34 years.

Each founder contributed a total $1000, but the income from the restaurant they will not receive. 80% profit Urban Space 500 will go to city projects.

The first meeting of investors scheduled for January 20, 2019. It will begin selecting projects for implementation.

Priority organizers are calling the projects to develop transport, urban planning and revitalization of spaces and promote the improvement of the city in accordance with the individual needs of different groups in society. Will still pay attention to the projects that form the ecological consciousness and progressive education for people of all ages.

Kitchen

Restaurant offers European cuisine with an emphasis on healthy food. The menu was developed by chef Druzi Café Anton Edicin. there are Superfoods (spirulina, beans ataman, nori) and universal dish, suitable for vegetarians. For Breakfast offer cereal with coconut milk and a smoothie-bowl. There are also salads, main dishes, desserts. The average check is 200-250 hryvnia."

The book that I most enjoyed buying, reading and re-reading this year is Living With The Gods by Neil MacGregor, who very famously gave us A History of the World in 100 Objects.

Based on the 30 part BBC radio series, which I haven't listened to, I was very lucky to have caught the exhibition itself at the British Museum earlier this year. Beginning with the 40,000 year old Lion Man sculpture to fascinating art and artefacts, the book weaves the incredible story of our existence through not just practise but also our individual understanding of faith. The convergence of many of the beliefs, the reasons why communities often choose to ignore them, and wear the differences as a badge will make us think hard about the need and purpose of religion.

Very early in the introduction MacGregor spells it out quite simply - 'that in deciding how we live with our Gods, we also decide how we live with each other'.

Illuminating, thought provoking and quite simply, staggering in its scope, Living With The Gods will remain one of the most important works (across its many formats) including as a print book.

I had loved Michael Ondaatje's Cats Table, a small, retro little gem, and his new novel Warlight is a deeper, more beautiful and haunting version of it. It returns to the writer's old terrain, WW2, this time telling the story of two siblings in post-blitz London left to their own devices by a mysterious and glamorous mother and looked after by a host of colourful characters.

And, of course, because this is Ondaatje there is tragedy and bloodshed and deep love at the centre of it -- in particular about a mother and her children. Maybe because I have a two-year-old and am immersed in motherhood, maybe because it seems to me Ondaatje has returned to real form with the last two books, this moved me and stayed with me this year like nothing else.

Sometimes you hear a writer talking about an idea and you know instantly that it's for you -- as editor, publisher, reader, citizen. One is so bombarded by big talk these days, and breaking stories, that to find a non-fiction narrative that explores interiorities within the context of the big political picture is unusual in itself. In The Anatomy of Hate, investigative reporter Revati Laul tracks the lives of her characters -- ordinary men and women caught in an extraordinary time -- through transformative moments in their lives over a decade-and-a-half. Gradually, she paints a canvas for us, of the way hate and violence play out among neighbours and strangers, of relationships built and damaged, of caste and class, tradition and rebellion, as they intersect and culminate in specific individual actions.

And yet, all of this sits lightly on the page. On the surface, it's pacy and anecdotal -- and shocking, given the subject. It's only as you get deeper into the narrative that you realise how every sentence has been born of years of research and reading, and hours of interviews, beginning in 2002, the year that changed something fundamental in India. This is a book that demands nuance and engagement from the reader, and I would recommend it without hesitation.

The best book I read this year - which we didn't publish - was Red Birds by Mohammed Hanif. With Hanif, the thing that draws me in, always, is how he never paints an underdog; even his victims are fighters and survivors. This is richly rewarding for the reader; we are often so buried under misery narratives (not that there's anything wrong with portraying the bleak perspective!) that the dauntless righteousness and the survival instincts of Hanif's characters are, quite apart from being tremendously entertaining, very gratifying indeed. For me, the novel felt like a reminder that we're all in this together, and we all had better count on each other if we are meant to survive the times we've found ourselves in.

I would also like to mention another extraordinary book: What We Talk About When We Talk About Rape by Sohaila Abdulali, which we did publish, and which I think will always be urgent, necessary, valuable and game-changing. This too is a book about survivors, and absolutely no one in the world could have written the book that Abdulali wrote.

The two books that I really enjoyed reading this year are The Epic City by Kushanava Choudhury (Bloomsbury Circus) and Great Textpectations by Ruchi Vadehra (Rupa). The Epic City portrays the world on the streets of Calcutta. The book is a fascinating read not only for those who have lived in Calcutta, but also for those who have only heard about the mystery surrounding the city. Having lived the better part of his youth in the USA, the author decided to return home and take up journalism as a profession in Calcutta. Obviously, he loves the city of his birth and his observations are honest and insightful. Interspersed with a lot of humour and sunny sarcasm, the book is his soulful, compelling and often hilarious account of life in a city that often looks like it lives in its own time zone. After Suketu Mehta's classic Maximum City on Mumbai, Epic City is the best city-centric book that I have read so far.

Ruchi Vadehra's debut novel, Great Textpectations, seems to suggest that 'text is the new talk'. Though a breezy read, it is not a mushy love story. The author breaks new ground by highlighting the fun text conversation between two young persons, which becomes instrumental in connecting their worlds. Amaya is a Delhi-based intellectually inclined 35 year old single woman who is financially independent and sexually liberated. She wants to open a boutique bookstore and live life on her own terms. While playing Scrabble online, she comes across Rohan and they soon get chatting. The actual texts the author weaves into the narrative are realistic, while also being highly original in their tone and tenor. When Amaya's boutique bookstore, to which Rohan has supplied a lot of concepts, is to be inaugurated, they decide to meet. Rohan goes to Delhi from Mumbai and the apprehension of a face-to-face meeting with all its concomitant baggage vanishes and their ideas resonate well with each other. We close the book with a satisfied chuckle as it ends with hints of a happily-ever-after.

POULOMI CHATTERJEE, EDITOR IN CHIEF AND PUBLISHER, HACHETTE

One of the best books I've read this year is The Essex Serpent by Sarah Perry. I came to it later than I should have (it was published in 2017) - the perils of being in the business of books! - but it came highly recommended (and beautifully packaged), and I waited for the right stretch of time so I could read it at one go. And I'm so glad I did! After a long time I think I found a book that had me completely immersed in it.

The story is set in Victorian England; the recently widowed (read liberated) Cora travels away from London to recuperate at Essex, where she hears of a monster water serpent that is said to be haunting the area. The eerie, gothic setting and tone, the overwhelming 'presence' of the mythic monster that leaves you guessing, the turns the plot takes - it is just a fabulous example of old-fashioned storytelling, the stuff that the best books are made of. It also has a tremendously layered narrative - you have the play-off between faith and science (as Cora goes hunting for fossils - and the serpent - she meets the rector of Aldwinter, who does not quite (or is it wish to) believe the creature exists); reality and the imagination; the expectations of men and desires of women.

And through all this what really kept me reading is the exquisite use of language. The descriptions of the marshes especially, the moss and fungus and bugs and mud, and the waters that seem to hide in them a constant menace. Not to mention the dialogues and exchanges between the characters, be it debate or banter or snarky disdain or confessions of vulnerability. I could go on and on, but yes, this is a book I will come back to again and again. I've recommended it and gifted it a dozen times over, and will continue to do so for some time to come.

PRASUN CHATTERJEE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, PAN MACMILLAN PUBLISHING INDIA

In 2018, I have been inspired by the idea of travel and read through Stewart Gordon's book on great routes of human history. His There and Back (Oxford University Press 2018) is one of the memorable books I read this year. Also, my interest in the reasons for the rise of Hitler and his appointment as Chancellor in January 1933 led me to read about the failure of Social Democrats in Germany and I picked up The Letters of Rosa Luxemburg (Verso, 2011).

In February, we published what is perhaps our most important and yet endearing book, The RTI Story: Power to the People by Aruna Roy and the MKSS Collective. The book charts the journey of the movement, from a call to action to legislation and how, along the way, ordinary citizens joined to relentlessly fight for transparency in governance. It is an extremely readable book, full of anecdotes and in the inimitable deferential style of Aruna Roy it gives credit to no one person, or organisation but to the thousands who rallied around the movement to empower people through the Right to Information. I particularly enjoyed reading about the remarkable RTI soldiers such as Norti Bai who dropped out of school at age 10 but went on to be computer literate, a sarpanch of her panchayat and teach girls computer studies, or Sushila who was a Class 4 pass who coined the slogan Hamara Paisa, Hamara Hisaab! When asked by journalists why she was fighting for the RTI she answered, ""When I send my son to the bazaar with Rs10 ask him for an account of what he spent; why should I not ask the government to be accountable when they spend crores in my name?""

With the RTI Act under threat there has never been a better time to read this book. A line from the introduction sums up best why I recommend this as the book of the year. ""This collective history empowers young readers to understand their capabilities and possible roles in shaping governance."" In these dim times, read this ""story of the success of Indian democracy"" to, perhaps, feel a sense of hope again.

If I could be indulgent and include another book! My Paper Chase by Harold Evans. I stumbled across this book this summer even though it was published nearly 10 years ago. What a charming, engrossing read by one of journalism's finest. Evans is a natural storyteller and his account of growing up in middle class Britain and being amongst the first editors from a background other than the typical public school-Oxbridge pool, made the book all the more engaging. Its pace and energy is matched with the stories he recounts of his time as editor of the prestigious Sunday Times - from the murder of his correspondent David Holden and the investigation into his death, to the Philby exposure, and the scoops by the Insight team... A brilliant read.

RAVI SINGH, PUBLISHER, SPEAKING TIGER BOOKS

One of the best books I've read this year, and which I wish we'd published, is Neelum Saran Gour's Requiem in Raga Janki, based on the life of the Hindustani singer and tawaif Janki Bai Allahabadi (1880-1934), a contemporary of Gauhar Jaan and just as famous. Neelum is an extraordinary writer of fiction who deserves far greater recognition than she has received, and this is perhaps her finest novel. Janki's life is the stuff of legend, full of glory and tragedy -- born to a wayward wrestler and a woman who was later sold into prostitution, she survived an attack in which she was stabbed fifty-six times (after which incident she was nicknamed 'chhappan chhuri').

Trained in Hindustani music by the biggest ustads, she eventually gained great fame as a singer, being invited to perform at mehfils and royal durbars across India, and becoming the first artist recorded by HMV. She amassed great wealth, loved freely and lost much, and converted to Islam -- but in the best traditions of Hindustani music, continued to find beauty and solace in Islam and Hinduism as in secular and sensual experiences forbidden in both religions. It couldn't have been an easy task to strike the right balance between credible storytelling and the melodrama necessary for a full telling of such a life, but Neelum pulls it off. The prose is brilliant, even if not all her experiments with language are successful.

It's a capacious novel, gloriously rich in period detail and rare histories. But its real triumph is the feisty narrator, a 90-year-old who may well have been a tawaif herself, a survivor and a bit of a subversive. The perfect voice to tell the story of a woman who pursued art, love, fame and wealth with equal passion."

It is time for renaissance for the country's Muslim community to develop itself and the nation, said Lt Gen (retd) Zameer Uddin Shah, who was also Vice Chancellor of Aligarh Muslim Unuversity, on Wednesday at a discussion on empowering young Muslims.

He said modern secular school education for the community is a must for its development.

""I have been repeatedly requesting all to join us for the renaissance in the Muslim community,"" said Shah in his key note address at a day-long workshop on 'Strategies and Approaches for Empowering Young Muslims -- Building Resilience, strengthening nation' in Patna.

He said children belonging to the community must be given best school education and for this the community should build schools with modern outlook with Islamic ethos on the lines of Christian missionaries-run institutions.

""We have set up a modern school in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. It is named Sir Syed National School. AMU students have donated Rs 51 lakh to build this school,"" he said. ""We hope to set up another similar school in Saharanpr"".

He said he was surprised when 40 Muslim families in Uttar Pradesh came forward to offer 2 acre each for setting up such schools in the state. ""Government funds and other forms of assistance may come, but Muslims have to set up world-class schools for children. Other communities have done so,"" he said.

Shah said the condition of the Muslim community today is similar to what it was in 1857. ""The community is marginalised, impoverished, victimised and at the bottom of development indicators,"" he said. ""But fault for this pathetic situation of the community lies with us. We have neglected the importance of education, particularly modern education.""

Others prominent people who addressed the workshop included Venkatesh Srinivasan of UNFP, Sadur Rahman of UNICEF, Amir Subhani, principal secretary Minority Welfare, Bihar, and Dr A.S. Nakdar, founder of American Federation of Muslims of Indian Origin.

The eight men thrashed Mazloom and Imtiyaz and hung their bodies from a tree. Imtiyaz was just 12 years old. The incident took place at Balumath, about 45 kilometres from Latehar.

Earlier this week, judicial magistrate Rishikesh Kumar convicted the eight accused - Arun Sau, Awadhesh Sahu, Manoj Sau, Manoj Kumar Sahu, Mitihlesh Prasad Sahu, Pramod Sahu, Vishal Tiwari and Sahdev Soni - and sent them to jail. Most of the eight are said to involved in cow protection activities, or in short, are Gau Rakshaks.

This is the second lynching case in which Gau Rakshaks have been convicted. In March this year, a fast-track court in Jharkhand convicted 11 out of 12 accused, including one BJP leader, for killing Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh in June 2017.

The relative success of lynching trials in Jharkhand is said to be mainly due to the steadfast pursuit of the cases by lawyers and activists and a certain degree of proactiveness on the part of the judiciary. Some also say that the police probes were more prompt compared to the cow vigilantism-related crimes in other parts of the country.

The case is important at several levels. First, the killings were so gruesome that the sight of Mazloom and Imtiyaz's hanging bodies became an iconic image depicting the violence by cow vigilantes. Second, the background of the convicts, particularly Arun Sau, shows how cow vigilantism is a combination of communal hatred and criminality.

Let's look at these two aspects in more detail through the accounts of eyewitnesses as well as the confessions of the convicts.

Eyewitnesses Recall The Horror

The conviction has largely been based on the eyewitness accounts of Mazloom's younger brother Munawar Ansari, Imtiyaz's father Azad Khan and one Mohammad Nizamuddin. Mazloom, Azad and Nizamuddin were all business partners. Their testimonies were published in a fact-finding report prepared by independent journalist Ajit Sahi in association with several human rights organisations. Here are some excerpts from the report.

Narrating the events that took place on the morning of the murders, Azad Khan said, ""At about 2:30 am on 18 March, Mazloom and Imtiyaz were going towards the cattle fair with eight oxen. I too left on my motorcycle a little while later"".

After travelling a certain distance, Azad saw that the eight oxen were grazing on the side and that Mazloom and Imtiyaz were missing. Soon he heard his son screaming for help. He saw a group of people armed with pistols abusing and assaulting Mazloom and Imtiyaz.

""I immediately hid in the bushes. I saw Arun Sau had climbed a tree and was fixing a rope. The others were on the ground trying to push Mazloom and Imtiyaz up to hang them from the tree,"" Azad said in his deposition.

Munawar Ansari named and recognised five of the eight accused - Arun Sau, Mithilesh Sahu, Manoj Sau, Avdhesh Sahu and Vishal Tiwari. He recognised the other three accused but didn't know them by name. Munawar said that Manoj Sahu had taught him in school and that Mazloom had once purchased building material from Mitihlesh's store.

Nizamuddin corroborated the events narrated by Azad and Munawar.

According to the fact-finding report, Nizamuddin also identified a man called Vinod Prajapati, who is associated with the BJP, near the oxen. Nizamuddin claims that upon seeing him, Prajapati shouted, ""Catch him, he's the real cattle trader.""

""Upon hearing that, I quickly started my motorcycle and fled. After that, I called up Munawar,""he said.

Prajapati, who was named in one of the FIRs, is still at large.

Confessions Of Gau Rakshaks

In April 2016, Catch News had published excerpts from the confessions of the Gau Rakshaks, which provided chilling details of how they killed Mazloom and Imtiyaz. These confessions were later made part of the charge sheet filed by the police in the court.

Manoj Sau said in his confession, ""On the morning of 18 March 2016, Avdhesh Sau called me at 3:30 am. He told me that he saw cattle being transported from Jhabar village towards Balumath. I told him to continue tracking the traders. Immediately, I called up Arun Sau. We summoned all other team members.""

""Then Arun Sau hanged the body from the tree. We wanted it to appear that the cattle trader had hung himself.""Pramod Sau

In his confession, Pramod Sau narrated in detail how the murder took place:

""We went to the kaccha road leading to Pakdi and stopped at Khaprail Bar. Then I, Arun Sau, Sahdev and Manoj Sau thrashed the two traders with sticks. Then Arun Sau got rope from a nearby village. He said that 'these are the people who sell cattle to the Qureshis of Balumath. We will not leave them alive. I will take revenge on them"".""Arun Sau used the rope to strangle the 30-32-year old trader (Mazloom Ansari) to death. He tied the rope around his neck and hung him from the tree. He ordered us to climb on the motorcycle and push the body upwards. I, Sahdev Soni and Manoj Sau began pushing the body upwards.""""Then Arun Sau hanged the body from the tree. We wanted it to appear that the cattle trader had hung himself"".

Another of the convicts, Mithilesh, confessed that he is a functionary of the local Gau Raksha Samiti and he was ""only carrying out the responsibilities given to him"".

""Around five months back, in October 2015, at Jhabar village, a meeting of some men of the village was called. At the meeting, I was given the responsibility of the area's Gau Raksha Samiti. I was given the task of countering people involved in cattle trade. On the basis of that mandate, I did what I did,"" he said.

How A Dacoit Became A Gau Rakshak

By most accounts, it seemed that Arun Sau, who hails from Balumath, was the leader of the group. His transformation into a vigilante Gau Rakshak is an important aspect of the entire story.

In his confession, that was part of the police's charge sheet, Arun said that he dropped out of school in Class 7 in 1997 and began working first as a truck-helper and then as a driver of one Munna Gupta, who initiated him into dacoity. According to his confession, he was caught in 2005 along with Gupta for carrying out dacoities. He was caught again a few months later, along with one Siraj Miyan of Palamau, for illegally transporting coal and was jailed for nearly a year.

After a few years of staying out of trouble, he was charged in two cases in Balumath in 2012. But the nature of his activities had changed. This time he was charged for rioting, unlawful assembly and intentional insult with the intent of trying to breach peace. From dacoity, he had moved to communal violence.

This revival in his criminal activities coincided with his increasing involvement in the Gau Raksha campaign. Around the same time, Balumath became a major hub for the cow protection campaign of an Uttarakhand-based preacher Gopal ji Maharaj. Arun Sau is said to have attended his discourses.

""In 2012, a campaign to prevent slaughter and trade of cows and oxen was started in Balumath. I became part of it. Because of this, I had altercations with Muslims of Balumath and I had to go to jail twice,"" he said in his confession.

In 2015, he had a confrontation with a few locals belonging to the Qureshi community, who thrashed him.

Even though a Muslim named Jasim Miyan gave him refuge after the attack, Arun Sau decided to ""take revenge"" on Muslim cattle traders. For this purpose, he created a ""team"" which included Manoj Sau, Mithilesh Sahu, Sahdev Soni, Vishal Tiwari, Avdhesh Sahu, Pramod Sahu and Majoj Kumar Sahu.

According to locals, Arun Sau is linked to the Bajrang Dal and had put up a board claiming to be the organisation's block in-charge. However, Bajrang Dal has denied that Sau was part of it.

Arun Sau's case shows how history-sheeters reinvent themselves as Gau Rakshaks. It not only provides them a legitimate pretext for their crimes, it also helps them gain social acceptability and influence. Conversely, some cow-protection organisers also seem to be using criminals like Arun Sau as their storm-troopers.

With a presence in almost every car market across the globe, Daimler and BMW have led the European charge in the global car industry not only in terms of technology but also in terms of volumes.

Daimler group, Mercedes' parent company, and BMW have been in talks for joining hands in terms of resources to develop future tech for transportation. While the joint effort had already got a green signal from the competition authorities in the EU some time ago, now America has also issued a nod clearing the path for the two German conglomerates to come together.

The global automotive industry is undergoing a tectonic shift after a century of building combustion engines to an electricity driven future. It is not only the powertrain that is reinventing itself, but along with it, the buying patterns, customer choices and the basic definition of transportation is being questioned in order to fit into the future that looms ahead of us.

In the meantime, while the traditional carmakers continued playing to their strengths, disruptors like Tesla built the alternate narrative and have now have gained the higher ground in terms of technology, learning and applications. Autonomous driving tech has been catapulted into the limelight by advances in artificial intelligence and the old-school manufacturers have been left behind, having to play the catch up game with small-scale startups not only from the Silicon Valley, but also from China. While China's imminent collapse, as predicted by the western economists, isn't even on the horizon, the capability of Chinese investors and hence, their technology has become a major threat to the global biggies of the automotive industry.

The joint venture would work towards developing and standardising non-specific components like batteries, motors, control systems et al. While that would certainly help in cost sharing, it might also lead to a faster development cycle. This would, ultimately, allow the Germans to catch up to the leaders in the multiple fields and help re-establish their supremacy on the back of the decades of production and quality management experiences that the existing thought leaders lack."

Tuning back

Varrun informs us that he is a composer first and engineer only after that. Starting young, at the age of six, he learned piano and later also delved into Carnatic classical music.Picking up the basics of the studio workstation, Cubase, in high school, he realised something that changed his life.

""Most composers are dependent on producers, so I wanted to be acquainted with that part of creation as well,"" informs the 28-year-old. When he set up his first studio in 2016, Varrun had already decided to only take up projects in entirety -- from recording to mastering.

Reaching out

Extending support to indie acts, Mondosonic also takes the avatar of a record label. ""I want to pick a few artistes every year and fund their production and distribution,"" says the producer, who already handles Thrissur-based, Ugly Old Men, and Kochi's Ago.

The most exciting news from the camp, however, is the opening of a bigger facility early next year.

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

As you sow, so shall you reap -- is how the proverb goes, and as far as loan waivers are concerned, TOI's headline tells us what it has reaped: ""Loan waiver pledge causes 24 per cent rise in MP farm NPAs"". The report explains, ""Anticipating relief, farmers start skipping repayments, impacting bank finances. Banks, in turn, go slow on fresh loans until state governments reimburse the amount written off, which often happens over several years.""

In the latest data, ""farm-related nonperforming assets in Madhya Pradesh doubled to 10.6 per cent of advances in a little over three years between 2014-15 and June 2018. In just a one-year period ending June, NPAs on farm loans in the state rose 24 per cent, according to the state-level bankers' committee.""

The Indian Express reports on the government's solution to NPAs in the public sector in its lead story, ""To ease their cash crunch, Govt to put in Rs 83,000 crore in public sector banks"". This is to ""increase its capital commitment to partly make up for the lender's shortfall in fundraising from markets"".

The 'Explained' box says that this will eventually lead to growth in the economy, ""This decision enables these banks to step up lending in the economy and absorb some of the collateral impact of stressed assets"".

HT puts the news on its front page flap, choosing to lead with RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha's decision to join the UPA in the upcoming elections. HT calls their recent alliance ""a shot in the arm"" for the Congress.

TOI editorial says this could spell bad news for the BJP, ""It's possible that BJP's formidable electoral machinery can be defeated through smart alliance building and seat sharing adjustments...The 2015 Bihar assembly polls that resulted in a mahagathbandhan victory against BJP provide a ready-made template for the opposition camp. Thus, BJP simply can't ignore these UP-Bihar rumblings,"" it says.

Also, the Bulandshahr story has also made it to the front page. TOI quotes actor as Naseeruddin Shah saying, ""In many areas, we are witnessing that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer.""

The Express also comments on the matter. ""The killing of a policeman is especially heinous because it violates a central contract on which the state is founded. In a constitutional democracy, a disarmed populace surrenders the capacity for violence to the state...the designated repository of the armed force is the police...their writ cannot be challenged... The killing of a cop violates this contract"" and ""threatens to open the door to anarchy"".

Parliament is in session, or at least it's supposed to be. A headline in the Express reads, ""Amid disruptions, Speaker calls meeting of rules panel"", referring to the constant forced adjournments and disruptions since the session began 8 days ago. A corresponding editorial calls it ""part of a larger crisis of institutions, where personalities and events and power-play have taken primacy over processes and norms.""

Other news

'No check on use of highly toxic pesticide', reads a grim headline in The Hindu. Monocrotophos pesticide is ""sold at subsidised rates to farmers at Raitha Samparka Kendras, is banned on vegetables"", and was the same one used to poison dozens of devotees in Karnataka's Sulwadi temple.

Even grimmer is the death of a Dalit girl who was set on fire, ""A 15-year-old girl from Agra, set on fire while returning home from school on Tuesday...The tenth grader suffered 70% burns, according to doctors and police,"" reports HT.

India Today anchor Rajdeep Sardesai asked Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot in an interview -- whether farm loan waiver is a solution to agrarian distress or not.

To this, Pilot replied, ""I want to assure everyone that our government will not only maintain but enhance social sector spendings.""

When asked whether it is an election game plan, Pilot said, ""We owe our farmers' loan waivers, cannot see them commit suicides. We are trying to tell the farmers that we are there for you. The country cannot move forward if large sections of our society remain backward.""

When asked about the long-term measures which Congress will take, Pilot said, ""Congress will try to eradicate the cartel of hoarders and black-marketeers, at least I will ensure that in Rajasthan.""

The government on 20 December sought Parliament's approval for an additional Rs 41,000 crore for PSB recapitalisation during the current fiscal.

Consulting editor Mythili Bhusnurmath said farm loan waiver will eat into banks' recapitalisation while chief executive of Indian Banks' Association V.G. Kanan mentioned that recapitalisation will help the banks lend.

Bhusnurmath said, ""Farm loan waiver will eat up the recap amount announced for banks and their requirement will increase. Government should have announced PSB recap at starting of their tenure.""

The profile of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, one of the most densely populated neighborhoods in the world, may have risen when it was showcased in the Oscar-winning movie ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" but my tour guide didn't particularly care about that at the moment. What concerned him more was the pejorative nature of the word ""slum"" and how outsiders perceived Dharavi, an area smaller than New York City's Central Park but where about a million people live and work.

""We don't want people to think slums are dangerous and full of lazy people,"" said Hitesh Vaidya, a guide for Reality Tours and Travel. The reality of daily life in Dharavi is sobering, however: Laborers work in unsafe conditions, and a lack of basic services like clean water and sanitation facilities endangers the health of residents. Mr. Vaidya and I spent the next couple of hours touring the many different industries and businesses within Dharavi, which included plastics recycling, textile manufacturing and food production. I left with a better knowledge of both the poverty and industriousness of Dharavi, as well as an understanding of Mr. Vaidya's point: that the two are not mutually exclusive.

Mumbai (sometimes called by its former name, Bombay) is an electric and complicated city, an extraordinary place, both uplifting and heartbreaking. Its eclectic composition of different groups and cultures makes it a difficult city to define, but for many, it's a city that represents possibility. Dharmesh Gandhi, a friend who lives in Mumbai, offered his take on India's financial center and one of the world's most populous cities: ""It's like New York,"" he said. ""Everything is happening here, so everyone wants to come here.""

After a four-day visit this past October, it was easy to see why: The shopping and entertainment options were excellent, and opportunities for great dining were second-to-none. And while the rupees flow freely in Mumbai, I was able to keep my spending under control.

A couple of logistical items: My flight, booked through Jet Airways, cost a bit over $200 for a one-way flight from Sri Lanka. As I was re-entering India, I had to produce my double-entry e-visa once more to passport control. My Uber ride from the airport was about 370 rupees, or a little more than $5. If you'd prefer not to use Uber, another popular service is Ola Cabs. I used both while in Mumbai, typically opening both apps and using whichever had a car closer to me. The ubiquitous tuk-tuk is conspicuously absent in much of Mumbai (""The traffic here is bad enough,"" Mr. Gandhi told me). In central Mumbai, you'll just see regular taxis. Fortunately, they're metered, with fares beginning at 22 rupees.

I was well-located in the Fort neighborhood of the city, close to the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus railway station, the huge Victorian landmark constructed in the late 19th century. My quarters at the Hotel Residency Fort, Mumbai, booked for $52 a night on Hotels.com, were modest luxury, roomy and air-conditioned, and with free breakfast.

A walk around the neighborhood was the first order of business: A stop by Mumbai's first Anglican church, St. Thomas Cathedral, established in 1718, was followed by a visit to the free Jehangir Art Gallery near Wellington Fountain. I enjoyed the Nayanaa Kanodia exhibition, ""The Quintessential Woman: A Celebration,"" which featured oil paintings and drawings celebrating feminism. Another exhibition, ""Rural Beauty,"" featured darker, more sensual pencil and pastel works by Parshuram B. Patil.

There are numerous fine museums in Mumbai, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya (formerly known as the Prince of Wales Museum of Western India). Admission is 500 rupees, plus an additional 50-rupee fee to take cellphone photos. The main hall of the museum, which features Rajastani temple columns and wooden railings from a nobleman's home, is topped with a great Islamic dome -- a nod to Mumbai's diverse history.

There are some wonderful statues of Indian deities on the ground floor -- Shiva, Ganesh, Brahma and Vishnu, some dating as far back as the sixth century. I also enjoyed looking at a series of paintings from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, done in the Rajasthani Bikaner style, particularly one depicting a scene from the Mahabharata epic.

My favorites, though, were probably the later work of Jehangir Sabavala, a Mumbai-born artist who died in 2011 at age 89. His paintings, which intriguingly join East with West, have elements of both Cubism and Impressionism. I particularly liked ""The Eye,"" as well as his somber ""The Raven,"" 2010 works that were two of Sabavala's final pieces.

The most interesting museum I visited, however, proved to be the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Mumbai City Museum, which claims to be Mumbai's very first, established in 1872 (100 rupees admission). The building itself is quite beautiful, and houses interesting artifacts like old model ships, ganjifa -- round playing cards that became popular under Mughal emperors in the 16th century -- and examples of pottery from the Sir J.J. School of Art near the turn of the 20th century. Particularly interesting was an exhibition documenting the movement of peoples to Mumbai over the years, from the Kolis fishermen of Gujarat in the 13th century to the Parsi, Surati and Khoja people that immigrated with the rise of the East India Company.

But it's not just the past that impresses in Mumbai -- the present is pretty happening, too. I headed to the club the Quarter one evening to catch a show with Azamaan Hoyvoy and his pseudo-funk trio (750 rupees for a standing ticket). They grooved through a number of pretty good covers, including ""How Deep Is Your Love"" and Allen Stone's ""Unaware."" Cocktails at the Quarter run in the 600 rupee range, but you can get a Kingfisher beer for 275.

I spent another evening at Shanmukhananda Hall, a large auditorium near the King's Circle train station, to take in a Lucky Ali concert (1,500 rupees, purchased through the website Book My Show). Lucky Ali, a Mumbai-born musician, went through crowd-pleasing soft rock favorites with a six-piece band. Between numbers, he took the opportunity to speak on various issues. ""If Ganga goes, where do we go?"" he asked, referring to the Ganges River. ""I think half of you probably haven't even been there. Go there! Plant some trees or something.""

About two-and-a-half miles to the southwest is Siddhi Vinayak Mandir, a beautiful temple dedicated to Ganesha and an essential place of worship for many Mumbai Hindus. I arrived just in time one evening for a puja, and after leaving my shoes at a counter outside, was ushered in to the sound of clapping, drums, bells and the smell of incense. A small, serene-looking Ganesha statue sat among orange and white flowers while a group of about 150 of us stood engaged in an intense, rhythmic call-and-response that changed tempos and melodies throughout the course of the next 30 minutes. For those looking to worship in a hurry, a ""quick darshan"" line can be entered for a payment of 50 rupees.

Any explorer of Mumbai will eventually need to try one of thousands of street vendors and restaurants that grace the city. Fortunately, there is no shortage of good options, and nearly every price point is covered. The Bombay street sandwich is one you'll see everywhere and, if you're feeling adventurous, certainly worth trying. A typical example features sliced cucumber, potato, onion, tomato and beetroot on toasted bread, served with a variety of spicy chutneys. At 25 or 30 rupees, it's an absolute steal.

Mumbai's reputation for street food par excellence is well deserved, and on Sheikh Memon Street, near the Juma Masjid mosque, I indulged in another treat: a plate of dahi puri (40 rupees), savory chickpeas stuffed into flaky puri shells, drenched in tart yogurt and dusted with spices and herbs. And no Mumbai street food discussion is complete without mentioning vada pav, the quintessential carbohydrate bomb that features a fried potato fritter squished into soft white roll (about 10 rupees, and it can be found all over).

The city does upscale dining with equal aplomb. Prateek Sadhu and Aditi Dugar own Masque, an elegantly repurposed industrial space that serves a 10-course tasting menu every day except Monday. The wine pairing alone, however, costs 6,000 rupees -- it's not exactly a place for penny-pinchers. Fortunately, Masque offers a bar menu for walk-ins like me looking for a lighter meal.

A very good sour eggplant toast (350 rupees), sweetened with tamarind and covered with caramelized onions, functioned as a kind of tangy eggplant pâté. A twist on pani puri, the classic street food, filled the thin shells with a cactus salad and corn mousse (350 rupees). Something described as pork okonomiyaki (500 rupees) really was like a sweet-glazed pork taco, competently prepared and served with a nice cabbage slaw. My server, Ayush, was particularly good and made me feel right at home.

Somewhere in the middle, you've got Gurukripa, an all-day casual vegetarian restaurant in the Sion neighborhood. There's an exceptionally good pav bhaji (96 rupees), a tomato-y mash of spiced vegetables served with a slab of rapidly melting butter. White rolls, crunchy papadum and a sharp onion salad round out the meal. Or there's Ling's Pavilion, a Mumbai institution, where the steamed pork with salted fish (500 rupees) and creamy fried corn curd (275 rupees) will help explain the country's love of Chinese food.

And don't forget the shopping. At the excellent Kitab Khana bookstore, I perused the sizable section entitled ""Books on Gandhi and by Gandhi"" before settling on Mohandas K. Gandhi's autobiography, ""The Story of My Experiments with Truth,"" for just 156 rupees. Another day, I set out in search of spices and ended up at Lalbaugh Market near Chinchpokli Station. Wandering down Dinshaw Petit Road, I followed the sound of loud, metallic pounding until I ended up at Vishwas, a specialty spice store where a shopkeeper was in the process of mashing a red substance into fine powder. I asked for haldi, or turmeric, and the man behind the counter spooned a 200-gram plastic bagful for 60 rupees.

But the best way to get a feel for the city might be to walk along Fashion Street on a weekend afternoon. Fashion Street is on the western edge of Fort, along Mahatma Gandhi Road, flanking a big public park, Azad Maidan, and branching off into Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil Road to the south. On the street, packed solid with shoppers, are hundreds of stalls containing anything you could possibly want to wear -- dresses, T-shirts, jeans and accessories.

I picked up a shirt for 250 rupees and, after a bit of haggling over the initial ask of 1,000, walked away with a pair of jeans for 600 rupees. Satisfied with my haul, I walked through the Karnatak Sports Ground, where organized teams were playing games of cricket. As the sun began to set, I crossed the street to Azad Maidan, past food vendors selling snacks and couples lounging on the grass while groups of boys played decidedly more casual pickup cricket games with tennis balls.

Over a good dinner at the Parsi restaurant Ideal Corner, I reflected on my time in a city that has so much to offer -- too much for one trip, certainly. Some trips are draining, but Mumbai left me feeling energized. I would have to return again to this dynamic city, and soon."

"339","p-1023545292","2018-12-21","http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/bath-community-fund-awards-19800-grants","Bath Community Fund awards $19,800 in grants","pressreleasepoint.com",FALSE,"BATH TWP., Ohio (Dec. 19, 2018) - On Friday, Dec. 7, Bath Community Fund of Akron Community Foundation announced its third round of grants to support nonprofit organizations serving Bath Township. Grants totaling $19,800 were awarded to 10 local nonprofits, bringing the fund's cumulative grantmaking total to nearly $50,000 since it was established less than five years ago.

Created in 2014 by a group of committed Bath residents, Bath Community Fund is a permanent endowment that supports programs that preserve Bath's historical and environmental legacy, enhance the local arts and culture landscape, serve youth through education and recreation, and meet residents' social service needs.

Several of this year's grants will benefit youth programs in Bath, including a $1,000 grant to Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio to support a running-based youth development program for girls in the Bath community. The program, which combines physical activity with discussions about self-confidence, bullying and healthy relationships, is offered to girls in third through eighth grade at Bath Elementary School, Richfield Elementary School and Revere Middle School.

""With the generous support of Bath Community Fund, 80 girls will have the opportunity to experience a program where learning to be healthy, confident and strong is the goal. Not only do these young ladies have the opportunity to unleash their limitless potential, but they also bond as a team and have the opportunity to celebrate each other for the unique ways that they are different,"" said Robyn Cutler, executive director of Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio.

While there is a fee to participate in the program, Cutler said girls are never turned away based on their ability to pay. Grants, sponsorships and individual donations allow the organization to offer scholarships to low-income families, ensuring all girls have the opportunity to lace up their running shoes.

""The perception that those living in (the Revere) district are equally able to participate in a program like Girls on the Run is incorrect,"" Cutler added. ""There are a number of girls receiving financial assistance, and funding from Bath Community Fund prevents this barrier. Girls on the Run is a program for every girl!""

Now in its third year of grantmaking, Bath Community Fund received 15 funding requests totaling nearly $53,000 - almost triple the amount it had available to grant, according to Mary Anne Krejci, chair of BCF's Grant Committee.

To expand the fund's impact, leaders of Bath Community Fund have set an ambitious goal to raise $2.018 million in celebration of Bath's bicentennial year in 2018 through the ""For Bath, Forever"" campaign. With an endowment of more than $2 million, the fund will be able to award at least $100,000 to nonprofits in Bath every year, forever. ""A fund of that size would allow us to meet all of the grant requests we received this year - twice over,"" Krejci said.

Other grants awarded in 2018 will support the construction of an additional restroom at Bath Community Park, provide food for Revere students in need, and make theater productions more accessible to senior citizens, among other projects.

The following is a full list of grants awarded in 2018:

Apollo's Fire the Cleveland Baroque Orchestra, to provide free and discounted concert tickets for students and senior citizens of Bath Township, $1,000

Bath Park Board, for the construction of an additional restroom at Bath Community Park, $5,000

Bath Volunteers for Service, to support the 42nd Annual Bath Tour of Distinctive Homes, $800

Crown Point Ecology Center, to support Tiny Tillers, a gardening and nature exploration program for preschoolers from the Bath area, $2,000

Girls on the Run Northeast Ohio, to support a running-based youth development program for girls in the Bath community that combines physical activity with discussions about self-confidence, bullying and healthy relationships, $1,000

Revere Power Pack Program, to provide food for Revere students in need to take home for the weekend, $2,000

Stewart's Caring Place, to provide support services for Bath residents on a cancer journey, $1,500

Victory Gallop, to replace aging fencing on the farm, which offers therapeutic horseback riding programs for children with special needs and life-threatening illnesses, $2,000

Western Reserve Historical Society, to expand the welcome center at Hale Farm & Village, $3,500

Western Reserve Playhouse, to build a new entryway that makes the playhouse more accessible to seniors and people with disabilities, $1,000

About Bath Community Fund

Established in 2014 by a group of committed Bath residents, Bath Community Fund is a permanent endowment dedicated to strengthening the Bath community for current and future generations by providing leadership, fostering collaboration and creating a legacy of charitable giving. The fund is committed to responding to community needs, helping the less fortunate, supporting local nonprofits, and reinforcing and preserving Bath's historical and environmental legacy. Since its inception, the fund has raised nearly $760,000 while reinvesting $48,435 into the Bath community.

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

Sample copy of this report @

www.gminsights.com/request-sample/detail/2792

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

"348","p-1023241462","2018-12-20","http://www.pressreleasepoint.com/study-offers-new-view-how-cartels-work","Study offers new view of how cartels work","pressreleasepoint.com",FALSE,"Media can only be downloaded from the desktop version of this website.

Suppose you were building a cartel -- a group of business interests who coordinate to fix high prices that consumers must pay. How would you design it? Received economic wisdom says transparency among cartel members is crucial: If colluding suppliers share information, they can keep prices high and monitor members of the cartel to make sure no one deviates from the cartel's norms.

A newly published paper co-authored by MIT economist Alexander Wolitzky offers a different idea: Firms do not have to share information extensively in order to collude. Indeed, the paper contends, extensive information-sharing can help firms undercut cartels and gain market share for themselves.

""If I'm thinking about entering your market, which I'm not supposed to do, but if I'm tempted to do it, then I can do it better if I have this information about your market,"" Wolitzky says. The corollary, he notes, is that there appear to be cases where ""by not sharing information about their pricing behavior, the firms make it easier to sustain collusion.""

The paper is thus a rethinking of an important policy topic: In the U.S., Europe, and across the world, governments are charged with regulating cartels and collusion, in an attempt to ensure that consumers can benefit from market competition.

Given the prevailing notion that data-sharing helps cartels, firms investigated for price-fixing can argue that they must not be illegally colluding if the evidence shows they have not been extensively sharing information with other businesses.

""Because of this conventional wisdom that firms that collude share a lot of information, a firm's defense is, 'We weren't sharing so much information,'"" Wolitzky says. And yet, as the new paper suggests, that level of cooperation may not be necessary for collusion to occur.

The paper, ""Maintaining Privacy in Cartels,"" is by Takuo Sugaya, an associate professor at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and Wolitzky, an associate professor in MIT's Department of Economics; it appears in the December issue of the Journal of Political Economy.

What's the whole story?

The current paper adds to a body of academic literature whose best-known component is ""A Theory of Oligopoly,"" a 1964 paper by economist George Stigler, which describes how the availability of information should help cartels maintain their grip on prices. Some subsequent empirical work also shows that in some conditions, increased transparency helps cartels sustain themselves.

Sugaya and Wolitzky do not deny that a degree of transparency among cartel members helps collusion occur, but they complicate this picture by introducing alternate circumstances, in which less transparency helps cartels thrive and more transparency undercuts them.

""We're investigating the generality of this [older] result, and whether it tells the whole story,"" says Wolitzky.

The paper by the scholars builds a new model of firm behavior oriented around the ""home-market principle"" of collusion, in which cartels reduce the competitive supply of products in each other's markets -- which may often be segmented by geographic reach. North American and European firms in the same industry, in this scenario, would stay away from each other's territory, thereby reducing competition.

In the study, the authors contend that there are three effects that increased transparency has on cartels. Transparency within cartels enables firms to keep each other in check, and it helps them coordinate prices -- but it also ""lets individual firms tailor deviations to current market conditions,"" as they write in the paper.

This last point, Sugaya and Wolizky assert, has been seriously underexplored by scholars in the past. In the model they propose, the ""deviation gain"" -- what happens when a firms leaves the cartel -- ""is strictly larger when all prices and quantities are observable,"" that is, when the firm has more information about its erstwhile collaborators.

Real cartels, low transparency

The proposition that a relative lack of information-sharing coexists with collusion is not just an arbitrary function of the authors' model, but something supported by empirical evidence as well, as they note in the paper. The European Commission, for instance, has uncovered several cartels that seemingly made a point of limiting transparency: The firms in question largely shared just industry-wide sales data among all members, not extensive firm-level data.

These low-transparency cartels include industries such as plasterboard production, copper plumbing tube manufacturing, and plastics -- all of whom structured their collusion operations around intermediaries. Those intermediaries -- industry associations, in some cases -- handled the sensitive information and only distributed small portions of it to the individual firms.

A more vivid example comes from a graphite manufacturing cartel, as Sugaya and Wolitzky recount. At a meeting of cartel representatives, each member secretly entered their own sales data into a calculator passed around the room, in such a way that the firms could only learn the industry-wide sales volume, not the specific sales data of each firm.

Such examples indicate that ""conventional wisdom may not tell the whole story"" when it comes to cartels and transparency, Sugaya and Wolitzky write.

To be sure, the new theory developed by the scholars does not propose a uniform relationship between transparency and collusion; it all depends on the circumstances.

""It would be nice to have a very thorough characterization of when more information among cartel members makes colluding easier, and when it makes it harder,"" Wolitzky says.

In the new model, Sugaya and Wolitzky do suggest that greater transparency corresponds with collusion specifically in volatile business conditions, which may necessitate more robust long-term projections of sales and demand. By contrast, given less volatile, more consistent consumer demand over time, firms need less transparency to deviate from tacit collusion agreements and undercut their erstwhile cartel partners. As the authors acknowledge, firm behavior within cartels, in a variety of these circumstances, could use further study."

Work in Northeast Florida with a wide range of partners, including PGA TOUR and THE PLAYERS Championship, aimed to improve health and wellness since 2013; will continue through sustained Foundation efforts

Jacksonville, FL - After launching its Community Health Transformation effort in 2013, today the Clinton Foundation released a report detailing the impact and improvements made in five years to target the health and wellness of the Northeast Florida community that included Baker, Clay, Duval, Nassau, and St. Johns counties. The Foundation, through the Clinton Health Matters Initiative (CHMI), works in targeted regions within a pre-determined timeframe to bring together diverse groups of stakeholders around a strategic blueprint to improve health outcomes, and then works to turn that plan into action. Northeast Florida was the third region to adopt CHMI's Community Health Transformation model, which has also been implemented and completed in Coachella Valley, California, Greater Houston, and Central Arkansas.

""The Clinton Foundation works with leaders in communities across the U.S. to improve the health and wellness of their residents, by addressing everything from diabetes and chronic illness, to the opioid epidemic and serious health inequities,"" said President Clinton. ""In Northeast Florida, our work has helped the community make progress on a wide range of issues such as addressing health disparities, improving access to mental health services and nutritional programs, and supporting recovery for those with substance use disorders.""

Beginning in 2016, an independent team of researchers from Wake Forest School of Medicine conducted the evaluation for the Northeast Florida region finding that CHMI has contributed to the development of several notable health-improvement projects including:

The five-year report also details how the Foundation will be engaged in the Northeast Florida region in the years to come by continuing to work with the local network of stakeholders to develop solutions that address the health needs and can be brought to scale.

About the Community Health Transformation Model

CHMI's Community Health Transformation model fills a key role in communities with a wide range of organizations who are all making a concerted effort to improve health and wellness. These entities include local governments; hospitals, doctors, and others in the provider community; local nonprofits and support groups; members of the local business community; and many others. Without one cohesive strategy, many of their efforts to promote health and wellness do not complement each other as effectively as possible, and therefore are not as impactful.

CHMI works in communities across the United States, helping unite community members around a blueprint for improving the health and wellness of residents, and then works to turn that plan into action. This means bringing together a wide range of interested groups and stakeholders in the community, charting out common goals and objectives for improving health, and ensuring coordination and resources to support programs that achieve these goals. This equates to more effective community action, and more impactful progress in improving the health of the community.

We take a careful and deliberate approach to building out the blueprint and identifying ways to improve health outcomes. In each of CHMI's communities, we:

CHMI works with regions disproportionately impacted by chronic disease to improve health outcomes and close gaps in health disparities. The Coachella Valley was the first community where we began this work - other current focus communities for our model, called the Community Health Transformation model, include Adams County, Mississippi; Knox County, Illinois; and San Diego County, California.

It will strengthen the existing infrastructure and facilities of this national institute.

IIT Bhubaneswar director Ratnam V Rajakumar said this at a press meet here on Thursday while discussing about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to his institute on December 24. ""We will complete the phase-II work one by one starting from January and add to the existing infrastructure within the deadline,"" he added.

PM Modi will dedicate the permanent campus of the institute to the nation in the presence of chief minster Naveen Patnaik, Odisha governor Ganeshi Lal, Union ministers Nitin Gadkari, Prakash Javadekar, Jual Oram, Dharmendra Pradhan, Mahesh Sharma, Manoj Sinha and Santosh Gangwar.

The campus spread over 936 acres of land at Argul near the capital city has seven academic schools with 1765 students and 149 faculty members. The institute has five centres of excellence. It has started phase-II expansion to accommodate 2500 more students.

Rajakumar said this phase-II construction includes three school buildings, a gigantic lecture hall complex for 6500 students, two boys' hostels, one girls' hostel and a multi-purpose hostel, faculty quarters block (198 seated), a staff block (44 seated), central research facility, central workshop, a student activity centre, play fields, auditorium, 50 per cent of commercial complex, dispensary, director's bungalow, sewage treatment plant and sewage network and external development including beautification work.

To take up the work under phase-II expansion in the permanent campus, the Centre has sanctioned Rs 850 crore.

With this, the institute has received a fund of Rs 1880 crore in two phases for its expansion and completion of the campus work.

""Besides the infrastructure works, our institute has received 81 sponsored and 101 consultancy projects worth Rs 55.61 crore in the last three years. More than 1000 research papers have been published in referred journals and filed 30 patents so far. We have recruited faculty of foreign origin along with Indian origin to provide education of international flavor to its students,"" said Rajakumar.

The IIT was started functioning in 2008 from a temporary campus in the city.

Later, it was shifted to its permanent campus at the foot of historical Barunei hill in Khurda district."

Once again, scientists are finding fresh evidence that exercise is basically a wonder drug. Research published in the

The review analyzed nearly 400 different studies on drugs and exercise, and focused on patients with top-line (systolic) blood pressure cuff readings of 140 or higher. The results suggested that it doesn't matter much what kind of exercise you perform; as long as you're moving, your doing good things for your heart.

""I wouldn't necessarily say that one form of exercise seems to be the winner,"" lead study author Huseyin Naci, a public health expert from the London School of Economics, said on a BMJ podcast.

For the study, Naci and his co-authors compared two sets of people. The first was a subset of people from some 197 exercise trials who already had high blood pressure. The second included patients from 194 other studies who were taking prescription blood pressure drugs.

""When we did this type of an analysis, comparing like with like, then we found exercise interventions to appear as effective as drug interventions in lowering systolic blood pressure,"" he said.

Systolic blood pressure is the top-line read on a cuff; it measures the amount of pressure that's in your blood vessels when your heart beats. Ideally, the number should stay below 120, since extra stress on the arteries can lead to a heart attack, stroke, or heart failure. But it can be tough to see physical signs of pressure building up in a person's blood vessels until it's too late.

Unfortunately, nearly half of US adults are above that 120 mark, leaving them at risk of succumbing to this so-called ""silent killer.""

Read More: Nearly half of all Americans have high blood pressure - here are 6 things you can do to reduce your risk

Doctors have been suggesting for decades that the most straightforward (and cheapest) way to reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure is to stay active.

It makes sense intuitively that more movement leads to better heart health: When you're more active, the heart doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood around your body. But this study was the first to directly compare how blood pressure-lowering prescription drugs measure up to exercise. Previous trials have found that drugs may be better at lowering blood pressure than exercise alone, but they weren't comparing apples to apples.

""A lot of the exercise trials are actually including people who are healthy and who do not have high blood pressure to begin with,"" Naci said.

His results suggested that a range of physical activities - including jogging, lifting weights, walking, swimming, and high-intensity interval training - all ""consistently seem to be effective in lowering systolic blood pressure,"" Naci said.

The new study results may serve as motivation for some people to get moving, but the study authors are still urging a cautious approach to their new findings.

""We don't think that, on the basis of our study, patients should stop taking their anti-hypertensive medications without a very thorough, careful discussion with their physicians,"" Naci said.

That being said, there are plenty of other good reasons to work out more. People who do can improve their mood, boost their memory, help their immune system stay strong, and pick up a bouquet of other health benefits, too.

If you're worried you may not be quite as fit as you should, there is a quick check you can perform right now: climb four flights of stairs without stopping. A recent study, which included more than 12,000 patients with known or suspected heart disease, found that if participants could climb four flights quickly without stopping, they were less likely to die from all sorts of causes, including heart disease and cancer.

So start taking those stairs. It could literally help save your life."

It will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. The initiative aims at ""Competent Civil Services for Good Governance"". He also launched Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws developed by DoPT in collaboration with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru.

On the occasion, RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, was also launched that will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place.

Speaking on the occasion, Dr Jitendra Singh said that Ministry of Personnel has undertaken various initiatives in the last four and a half years. He said that the launch of these initiatives on the eve of Good Governance Day shows Government's commitment to 'maximum governance, minimum government'. He also spoke about the initiatives taken by DARPG. He added that the number of grievances has increased due to prompt response of the Department. But awareness needs to be generated in society about grievance disposal mechanism, he added. He said that during the last four years, the participation of districts has increased in the Civil Services Day awards, which has transformed the whole process. Commenting on the RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC, he said that this is an extension of online RTI mechanism that is available to the users. Speaking on the improvements made by DoPT in the training programmes, the Minister said that the training programmes of India are now being acknowledged worldwide. He further said that 'Anubhav' initiative of the Ministry is a good base for research activities and now the department is in the process of preparing a manual based on these write-ups. The Minister also urged the state Governments to adopt these initiatives towards good governance and improved training techniques.

The DoPT Secretary Dr C. Chandramouli said that the launch of the initiatives today is yet another milestone which aims at capacity building of Government officers. He said that appropriate training is of vital importance for public service delivery. This online programme is a part of overall 'Digital India' flagship programme of the Government. The DoPT will encourage and keep adding more programmes to this platform, he added.

Secretary, DARPG & Pensions, Shri K.V. Eapen said that Department of Pensions has taken several initiatives for the benefit of pensioners such as organising First Pension Adalat, root cause analysis of the grievances and issuing Digital Life Certificates etc. He said that recently many changes have been incorporated in National Pension System (NPS) based on the recommendations of a committee of Government.

iGOT (Integrated Government Online Training Programme)

The National Training Policy-2012 mandates that all civil servants will be provided with training to equip them with the competencies for their current or future jobs. The current structure of training for Government servants including domestic and foreign training is mostly available to very small section of the government servants. However, consequent upon some recent initiatives undertaken by Department of Personnel and Training, Government of India aimed at providing training to cutting edge level functionaries in the Central/State Governments, significant changes have taken place. The outreach of the existing training setup is very limited in view of the large workforce employed in various States/UT Governments. The Integrated Government Online Training Programme (iGOT) launched by Minister will augment the existing training mechanism with online module-based training coupled with certification. This will make training inputs available to government servant on site and on flexitime basis. Furthermore, the training will be focussed and targeted to the requirement of the officials.

The e-Learning mode provides unparalleled opportunities for training to a large number of civil servants scattered all over the country. The latest technologies make available vast resources of learning material and online courses, providing the individuals enormous choices and flexibility in learning. The online training programme through Massive Online Open Courses mechanism would be a platform to bring together the numerous Government and other training institutions for providing a single point of access to the repository of training resources. This will provide a broad training eco-system creating synergies across various premier training institutes of the country and will cater to the training needs which can encompass all the officials in the entire hierarchy of Central and State Governments. This platform will ultimately build a large training eco-system. The training courses under this programme will be accessible through DoPT's web portal. Among the bouquet of Training Courses on offer through this initiative are those offered by MIT, USA too. DoPT has collaborated with JPAL, South Asia and MIT, USA to launch MITx Micro Master Programmes for the government servants.

Hybrid Course on Administrative Laws

The DoPT, realising the need for training inputs in Administrative Laws, has collaborated with the premier law school, National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Bengaluru to develop and offer Long Term Diploma programme and Short Term Courses in these areas. The courses to be delivered by NLSIU have been launched by Minister today.

RTI Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC

The Right to Information (RTI) Portal on Judgments/Orders of Supreme Court, High Courts and CIC has been developed by Institute of Secretariat Training and Management (ISTM), New Delhi. This Portal will provide a learning environment for all stakeholders under which a repository on the landmark cases on the RTI will be available at one place. The Portal also makes available the gist of the replies given by Central Public Information Officers (CPIOs), First Appellate Authorities as well as the Supreme Court. It will be helpful in learning the latest trends of implementation of RTI Act as the judgments/orders given by Central Information Commission, High Courts and Supreme Court are always a crucial source to track the developments on this subject.

What's not to love. In a world of where we feel over worked and under appreciated, stuck in traffic and yet all over the place - we need more Taimurs. Because kids, anyone's kids represent our happy place.

Taimur represents our kid obsession. Yes india's embarrassing kid obsession where we feel it is totally okay to crowd around a strangers's kid, pick him up and pull his cheeks.

Just walk down south Chennai's bustling middle class Tirunvanmiyur and you will see jumbo hoardings of the local kid whose birthday it is, where the birthday girl or boy is wearing their party dress, complete with kala teeka and photo-shopped roses.

Rich or not, we find our solace in the sight of happy-looking children and this kid whether he likes it or not is the collective solace of a nation that is more than anything else in desperate need of a distraction.

Which is why the endless whir of the camera. Which is why the endless photos from sports day to birthday to holiday that we drink up like a tall glass of rose Falooda. Which is why even though he's only two we've seen more pictures of him in two years that mere mortal celebs would have in the launch times!

For a child, growing up in a city can be both a delightful experience as well as one fraught with dangers. Remember the scene from the movie Taare Zameen Par in which the boy walks the streets of Mumbai and experiences all its sights and smells? It was a heady scene, but almost unimaginable for our children.

The city street is seen as dangerous today -- not a place to explore and discover. This applies equally to women, who are increasingly unable to access the city for pleasure and discovery. In most of our cities today, children are less able to venture out on their own. In Gurugram, because streets have not been designed for walking or cycling, children are not encouraged to go out by themselves at all. Further, safety concerns mean even more protection for children. For many of them, walking to school is not a reality anymore.

A child-friendly city is being talked about nowadays by international actors as well as the United Nations. Such a city would have to include features such as protection from violence, allowing children to grow up in an inclusive space, providing them with good quality open areas as well as letting their voices be heard regarding issues that affect their lives. A child-friendly city must also provide access to quality services and not discriminate against children, irrespective of their gender, social status and other such factors. In India, Bhubaneswar is one city that has included the phrase ""child -friendly"" in their planning -- and made safe paths for walking, good crossings, streetlights, well-maintained parks.

Children must have a voice in the kind of city that they want, as they carry the burden of the future. They have clearly demonstrated their ability to be political actors. In the recent civic action to protect the Aravali Bio Diversity Park, students raised their voices to claim their right to green, open spaces. The campaign against bursting firecrackers has been very successful, in part because the voices of children were most prominent. Children must be seen as contributers to making a city a better place for all.

Equally important are children who have fewer life opportunities because of economic and social issues. Good schooling and access to services are essential to building a more inclusive society and therefore, more inclusive cities. For example, not all children have access to parks, mostly those who live within gated communities. I have seen that sometimes children from economically weaker sections of the society are prevented from playing in public parks, which is an extreme form of discrimination. The right to play is as important as the right to go to school.

We are also living in times when screens occupy children's time so much that they do not actually enjoy public spaces. Recent research has shown that the free play that children engage in, especially without the supervision of adults, helps teach them many social skills. Children must be included as important voices in the planning of cities so that they are able to influence their present as well as their future.

After procuring an oldbuilding in the city to convert it into a supermarket, Porkai Pandian had a decision to make. ""The building was too old and it wasn't feasible for me to start a supermarket. I needed a change of plan. Considering the lack of good confectionaries in the city, I decided to open my own! 'The Cake Point' was born,"" he recalls.

The rest is history. In the last decade, he has opened about 35 outlets across the state and is one of the most popular brands in the city. ""We set our first shop in Anna Nagar in 2001. From 2007, we have been expanding to several parts of the state, have franchise run outlets even in places like Arakonam and Puducherry,"" he shares. The engineer-turned-entrepreneur and self-confessed foodie tells us more about his life.

Excerpts from the conversation:

Was your decision to become an entrepreneur influenced by your father?

My father was a businessman and a Singapore-based auditor. He always did want me to start my own business, but I think it was my dream too. When I decided to start my new journey, everything fell in place. My father and my mother-inlaw have been pillars of support.

There were initial challenges -- lack of manpower, long work hours and so on. But, my wife and I worked really hard to make the brand stand out. The customers noticed us for what we were and we have to thank them for recognising us.

So do you bake? Not really. I have certainly learnt the art of baking, but I am not an expert. On the flip side, I can eat pretty well. I am a foodie! I think I have been interested in food for as long as I know. For the most part of my youth life, I was a hosteler. So whenever I went home, I used to help my mother in the kitchen and cook. That experience has overspilled into my adult life as well.

Later, after I got married my mother-in-law became another source of inspiration for me to cook. I have learnt quite a bit from her, just by observing her in the kitchen.

A dish that you cook for your family? I cook different varieties of mutton, prawns and chicken. My children have different tastes when it comes to food. So, I prepare it according to their taste. But as a family, we are all inclined towards Chinese cuisine. We love the food and its taste. In 2011, your company was recognised by the India Book of Record for creating the longest decorative cake in the country.

Will there be another record attempt in the future? Yes, we made a 441-foot long cake in association with Lions club. My next aim will be an attempt to enter the Guinness Book of World Records. But, I am looking for the right opportunity and partnership. This is certainly something that I want to achieve. This industry has given me fame,name and reputation. I want to give something back.

What's your idea of a holiday?

Quality time with my family and travelling with them. Like I mentioned earlier, during my entire school and college days, I lived in hostels. My father was in Singapore. So, a proper family time was very minimal. I absolutely make it a point to spend time with my family. A yearly vacation is always on the cards. All our trips have been extremely memorable.

Have your trips ever influenced the cakes and bakes in your store?

Definitely. I have toured Europe, China, Singapore, Malaysia.and a few other places. Every time I travel, I ensure I bring some inspiration back home. But it is localised and modified to suit the taste of our customers. Keeping myself updated about the trends in the industry is something I never miss. One thing about you most people don't know? That I play cricket! I wanted to keep myself physically fit. So, I enrolled in King Star Cricket Academy in Anna Nagar. Every weekend, I head to the academy and play a good game. I play for the team and I enjoy it."

The deceased was identified as Joshna, a Class 7 residential student of the Morarji Desai Residential School. According to sources, the school had a total of eight bathrooms, four each for girls and boys. The four bathrooms for girls which were built on a stormwater drain collapsed at the same time.

Preliminary investigations have revealed that the private building was constructed adjacent to a stormwater drain. The walls of the bathrooms collapsed reportedly because of the faulty building plan, said Kolar Superintendent of Police Rohini Katoch Sepat, adding that a detailed enquiry will be conducted soon.

According to the principal Bharathi, there are 162 students staying at the residential school. The school was earlier functioning from a private campus at Devaraya Samudra in Mulbagal, but was shifted near Nethaji Nagar and has a total of ten rooms on two floors.

Sources said that the building belongs to Irshad who rented it out to the school after getting it verified from PWD officials recently. The school started functioning from this building from July 7 this year.

Dr. Dayanand Pai, Managing Trustee of the School, Mrs. Kalai Selvi, The Head of the School, graced the occasion. The program began with the arrival of official school Mascot, ShilpTusker.

The students displayed a wide array of talent during the sporting events, Yoga, march-past, track events, game depiction exercises, mass P.T. and Taekwondo. They mesmerized the audience with their energy as the proud parents cheered on. Dr. Pai awarded the medals and the certificates to the winners of the various sports events.

The school emphasizes on sports as a curriculum and carries the belief that academics and sports are the building blocks for a child's development. Sports has been given a strong boost by the Khelo India scheme and other programs and the school has been encouraging this move further.

Speaking on the momentous day Ms. Kalai Selvi, Head of the school, Vidyashilp Academy said, ""It was overwhelming to see our children participate in the day's events. The tantrums they threw, and the multiple excuses they offered to avoid practice sessions never came in the way of offering their best for the day. The little feet's marching, waves of smiles extending from one corner to the other, the tough taekwondo moves, the flexible yoga postures, perseverant racing and celebrations was certainly a feast to the eyes. The self-esteem boost for those who had their medals dangling and the resilience build for those who couldn't make it this time will go a long way in nurturing the soft skills of our children.

A four-year-old boy was injured when a molestation accused and his accomplices went on a rampage in Ghaziabad and attacked the survivor's family while they were on way to the police station to lodge a complaint against him. The survivor is the injured boy's cousin, police said.

On Monday, a 14-year-old girl who studies in class V was molested in Masuri near NH-24 when she was returning from school.

The girl's father alleged, ""My daughter was returning home from school when the accused molested her and also pushed her to the ground when she tried to resist. He is from an influential family and is into body-building and is, hence, strong. After finally returning home, my daughter narrated her ordeal to my wife.

The family said they had to spend the entire day running from pillar to post to get the four-year-old boy treated. He is now being treated at Sanjay Nagar combined district hospital.

Police said that on the basis of their complaint, an FIR has been registered under IPC sections 354 (molestation), 308 (attempt to commit culpable homicide) and provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

"368","1022867672","2018-12-20","https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/hu-bos-an-elephant-sitting-still-tarkovskys-stalker-the-godfather-and-the-concept-of-slow-cinema-5763511.html","Hu Bo's An Elephant Sitting Still, Tarkovsky's Stalker, The Godfather, and the concept of slow cinema- Entertainment News, Firstpost","Firstpost",FALSE,"One of the highlights at the Jio MAMI Mumbai Film Festival with Star this year, was Hu Bo's Chinese film, An Elephant Sitting Still. There are many things that are noteworthy about it. One, the director committed suicide soon after finishing his film, reportedly due to conflicts with the producers regarding creative control - Elephant is, thus, both a defiant debut feature as well as a tragic swan song. And two, it runs nearly four hours, which is a cause for much hand-wringing at a film festival. If you watch it, you're probably missing out on two other films. But then, as a serious movie-goer, you have to watch these things once in a while - it's the cinephile's equivalent of Vipassana. And at least, it's an easier decision than the one I faced at the Berlin Film Festival a couple of years ago, when Lav Diaz's A Lullaby to a Sorrowful Mystery was screened. It ran some eight hours, which means you lose out on four other films.

What's remarkable is that these aren't just long films but also slow films (even when compared to the pace of the average art-house film). In the Q and A session after the screening of the deliberately paced Manoj Bajpai starrer Bhonsle, again at the Mumbai Film Festival, the director Devashish Makhija said one of his biggest concerns was just how long to hold a shot. He said he was constantly worried about what the film needs and how to hold the audience. Directors like Lav Diaz, on the other hand, don't seem to worry about this at all. In an interview with The Upcoming, Diaz said that cinema needs to be emancipated from the clutches of the market. ""That 90-minute, two-hour thing is totally f**ked up. I don't want to commodify my film. My cinema is not a product like that.""

At the post-screening conference in Berlin, Diaz denied that Lullaby was ""slow cinema."" He said it's just... cinema. ""I don't know why every time we discourse on cinema, we always focus on the length. It's cinema, it's just like poetry, just like music, just like painting where it's free, whether it's a small canvas or it's a big canvas, it's the same ...."" But it's not the same, is it? Imagine a scene we've seen in a hundred films: a character (say, a woman named Annie) uses an elevator. Usually, this is how the scene works. The elevator doors open. Annie gets in. The elevator doors shut. CUT TO. The elevator doors open on the destination floor. Annie exits. END OF SCENE. But in An Elephant Sitting Still, we see the full ride in the elevator, as it passes through all floors. The scene is thus closer to real time than to cinema time. (It's how we ride in elevators.)

To some extent, we have seen slow scenes in mainstream cinema as well -- The Godfather being a great example. But take the stretch where Michael Corelone kills the gangster named Sollozzo. They meet in a restaurant. They eat. They chat. Then, Michael steps into the restroom to search for the gun his men have hidden. Then, he comes out and shoots Sollozzo. The event takes about five minutes to play out (see clip above), which is an enormous amount of time to depict a shooting. But then, the ""slowness"" of the scene is alleviated by the tension building up. Will Michael keep convincing Sollozzo that he's incapable of murder? Will Michael find the gun? Will this nice college kid who's never killed before summon up the guts to shoot Sollozzo? The rhythms, thus, have dramatic meaning, as opposed to the elevator scene in An Elephant Sitting Still, where the slowness serves a different purpose.

But first, a bit about the movie, which is set over the course of a single day. We are in the city of Manzhouli, in Northeast China, and we watch four narrative threads - centred on lower-middle-class citizens, affected by China's economic downturn - being spun out. A man commits suicide by jumping out of a window. A schoolboy stands up to a bully. His classmate sleeps with a school official. And a man living on a pension is sent to a nursing home by his son. The aesthetic is defined by long Steadicam takes, which are as ""slow"" as the creature in the titular metaphor: all four characters hear of an elephant that has stopped eating and sleeping, apparently having given up on life. Their suffering mirrors the animal's (and the director's suicide adds another, unintended, layer of suffering). Here, the reason for the slow rhythms isn't dramatic as much as experiential. These aren't the rhythms of cinema. They're the rhythms of life.

This is not how most people want to consume cinema, especially in this era when the average shot length is some two seconds. (If you're interested in this subject, do head over to Cinemetrics Database, an online database for Average Shot Lengths and other measurements.) Now let's look at one of the most famous ""slow"" films of all time: Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker (1979). The English author, Geoff Dyer, wrote a book about the film, and he wrote in The Paris Review about the Russian filmmaker's singular obsession: time. He refers to Tarkovsky's statement: ""I think that what a person normally goes to the cinema for is time, whether for time wasted, time lost, or time that is yet to be gained."" Dyer adds, ""This sentiment is only a couple of words away from being in perfect accord with something even the most moronic cinemagoer would agree with.""

And what are those ""couple of words""? As good. As in, Dyer says, ""What people go to the cinema for is a good time', not to sit there waiting for something to happen."" As opposed to this collectivistic determination of cinema, listen to how Lav Diaz makes movie-watching seem so individual. He said, ""I am a son of a farmer and a teacher, and when I grew up in Cotabato on Mindanao, in the boondocks, I had to walk to school, ten kilometers every day, go back home another ten kilometers. Same thing in high school. I had to walk five kilometers every day. So this type of slow aesthetics is very much part of my culture.

No other Mohiniyattam dancer has garnered as many national accolades as Kanak Rele, who was awarded the first Guru Gopinath National Puraskaram of the Government of Kerala.

On being informed about the Puraskaram, her response was: ""For the last four decades, I had identified myself with Keralites and now the government too has approved it."" Her contributions have been monumental in rejuvenating the lyrical dance form of Kerala.

As a child with an inclination for dance, she was fascinated by performances of Kathakali and Mohiniyattam, which she watched from close quarters at Shantiniketan, while staying in West Bengal with her uncle. In addition, she was exposed to veterans of all Indian classical dances in Mumbai. At the age of seven, Kanak was initiated into Kathakali by Guru Karunakara Panicker. He stayed at her home and trained her for many years, even after her studies abroad. This moulded her into a consummate performer.

Her passion for dance saw her turn away from medical studies even after she was selected and had paid the fee for the course. She took up Industrial Law went on to study International Law at Manchester University, UK, for her post graduation. As her specialisation was Civil Aviation, she landed a post in Air India. But her decision to become a professional dancer compelled her to turn down the offer against the wishes of her parents. Her husband's support and guidance of Karunakara Panicker enabled her to pursue her own choice.

Kalamandalam Rajalakshmi, who was based in Mumbai in those days, was helpful in introducing her to Mohiniyattam. She taught Kanak the basic lessons as practised in Kalamandalam, which had revived the dance form during 1930s.

The exquisite charm of lasya attracted her and she was determined to delve deep into the roots of the dance form, which had its first revival during the period of Swati Thirunal and had then gradually sunk into oblivionowing to a variety of reasons. It may be remembered that when Poet Vallathol introduced Mohiniyattam in Kalamandalam, there was a long search for a teacher and a student as the very name of the dance had a social stigma attached to it in those days.

A grant from Sangeet Natak Akademi at this juncture was a blessing as it enabled her to meet surviving performers and scholars who could enlighten her about the evolutionary stages of Mohiniyattam. Her pursuit received further impetus thanks to a grant from the Ford Foundation. She met and interacted with stalwarts like Kalpurathe Kunjukutty Amma, Thottassery Chinnammu Amma and Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma and filmed them. The recordings are a prized possession in the archives of her Mumbai institution even now.

She observed that Kunjukutty Amma's abhinaya techniques bore resemblance to those of Nangiarkoothu and Kamsa Natakam. The footwork had much in common with Thullal, Padayani and Arjunanrittam. Chinnammu Amma's style owed much to Thiruvathirakkali.

Kalyanikutty Amma's had some elements of the both, but, at the same time, also embraced entirely different features. The study established and highlighted the correlation of folk, ritualistic, semi-classical and classical arts.

The veteran dancer has been successful in recreating the dance form based on the traditional and the technical format and help evolve a teaching methodology. Intensive research on the kinetics of the dancer, based on the movements of volution (geometrical patterns) and revolution (spiral), so characteristic of Indian classical dances, and an analysis of audio and film documentations against the backdrop of Natyasastra, Hasthalakshanadeepika and Balaramabharatam gave shape to the 'Kanak Rele School' of Mohiniyattam. She propounded her 'kine-aesthetics' after taking advice from experts from manifold disciplines, including medical science.

Her monumental work earned her a doctorate from the University of Mumbai.

While she had dwelt at length on the prayoga of the dance form in the first edition of the book Mohini Attam -- The Lyrical Dance (1992), she suceeded in building up a sastra in the revised edition (2013).

Bhava Niroopana (1996), another book that followed, is a comprehensive account of the theoretical basis of abhinaya and it traces the development of our religious thought and its influence on aesthetics. The two books are followed in many institutions across the country, including Kerala Kalamandalam, for undergraduate and post-graduate classes.

The foray into Sopana Sangeetham happened after a meeting with Kavalam Narayana Panicker in 1982. This was providential, for she was able to overcome many rough edges experienced while following music and talas of the Carnatic system. ""It is only when I started working with Sopana Sangeetham that things arranged themselves in proper shapes and hues. The very basic movement that sustains Mohiniyattam dancing is andolika or the oscillating movement. These kinetic patterns are beautifully aided by the gamakas of Sopana Sangeetham that strengthen and beautify the body movements. My inspiration for productions highlighting the trauma of women in society, which were based on different women characters in Indian mythology, has been Kavalam's compositions,"" she says.

She had led innumerable workshops with him in Mumbai. Even during her visit four days before his demise, the duo discussed plans to organise more such workshops.

Nalanda Dance Research Centre where she's the director, has been recognised as a Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation by the Ministry of Science and Technology of the Government of India. This is the only dance institution in the country to be awarded this prestigious honour.

Meanwhile, Nalanda Nritya Kala Mahavidyalaya was established for the popularisation of her style. Thanks to her perseverance, the institution has been affiliated to the University of Bombay. It is perhaps the first institution in the country to award university degrees of BFA, MFA and PhD in Mohiniyattam. Nritya Bharati, a documentary of seven Indian classical dances produced by Nalanda, has been acquired by the Ministry of External Affairs as an official capsule for all Indian missions abroad."

The almost limitless provision of education in the U.K means that people can have any training they want. An excellent example of a valuable and practical course is Introduction to Fashion and Textile Design. However, what makes this a good choice for you?

To begin with, let's take a look at the course itself and what you would find yourself doing while you took part in it. The program is designed to provide you with an introduction to fashion and textile design, as you may have gathered from the title. You'll be taking a look at different fashion concepts, both from a design perspective and a practical one. There's even a chance to design a prototype during the course and assemble it.

There are many different reasons why this is the correct choice for you. If you're someone who is interested in fashion and what it can offer people, then this is the course you should be signing onto. It's a dynamic program which provides a look at some of the critical components of fashion and textile design and then provides you with the knowledge needed to move onto a more advanced course later on in life.

For those of you who may be sceptical, it is essential to grasp the real value of education. There is no doubt that building a good understanding of a chosen field can be exceptionally important. Dr Roy Ale, Marketing Executive at Oxford Summer School, says that 'the merits of education run deeper than anyone could predict at first glance. We've had many capable young minds come through our halls, and they all left with their minds broadened and armed with a greater chance of making a career in the future'.

Inspiration isn't always easy for people to find within themselves, but we strongly urge people to try and get access to education wherever they can. For many, it can foster a profound love of a particular subject, and in other cases, it can be the start of a lifelong career in the field. However, the real value of education falls to each person to try and grasp, so we encourage you to come along and see what it means for you.

Overall, the value of this course is considerable, and it is heavily encouraged that people come and experiment with it at their leisure. When trying new things, there is an understandable sense of anticipation and worry. What if you don't like what you're confronted with? What if you struggle? However, it's important to push past these worries and concerns and focus on the positives. There's no doubt that this is an excellent course to try and participate in, and one which will undoubtedly enrich your life if you decide to undertake it."

If you want to see an Indian farmer on screen, tough luck. You might have to buy a ticket to an international film festival. The farmer has all but disappeared from the mainstream Hindi film industry, the same industry which gave us Mother India, Do Bigha Zameen, and Upkar. While smaller films focussing on the plight of the Indian farmer have been made (and feted elsewhere), you are unlikely to know of them.

They barely get a wide release, and the entertainment media do not want to touch them - the Indian farmer and his stories simply do not appeal to the candyfloss imagination that Bollywood caters to. How can one have an item number shot in Monaco in a story about a farmer in Vidarbha?

The rural landscape itself seems to have vanished from the stories we tell on celluloid. Can you think of one big 'Bollywood' film in recent times that has featured a big star and focussed on the lives of rural Indians? There was Lagaan, but cricket was its hook. There was Kadvi Hawa last year, but did you watch it? Peepli Live, in recent memory, came closest to addressing the issues of the farmer to a mainstream audience largely due to it being an Aamir Khan production.

In this 2010 film by Anusha Rizvi, Natha, a farmer, is encouraged by his own brother to commit suicide so his family could get a loan waiver and financial compensation after his death. The news of his impending suicide somehow attracts media attention, and reporters, OB vans and all, descend upon his village to capture the drama. While Natha, now obligated to kill himself, clearly does not want to, and runs away, even as another villager away from the spotlight Hori, who digs dirt for a living, dies.

The seen and unseen stories of Natha and Hori play out in the real world in similar ways - the inability of farmers to pay off debts and therefore resorting to suicides is a narrative we hear all too loudly ahead of any election, but the underlying reasons - the unseen - of a mental health epidemic in rural India, of poor agrarian reforms, of rising input costs and diminishing returns, of fragmented land holding, are barely ever spoken of.

The plight of the farmer, though, finds itself in centre stage in the run up to any election in India. Politicians of every stripe make promises of farm loan waivers ahead of every election. But barely heard are promises to usher in long term agrarian reforms.

Farm loan waivers are like a unicorn - it is the promise of the magical that hides the realities of the practical. They are also like Andy Warhol's fifteen minutes of fame. Loans waived for now... but what next? And how do they impact the larger economy? These are the questions we will address as we dig deeper into the issue of farm loan waivers.

Competitive populism

Hours after being sworn in as the 18th Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh, ending the 15-year-long drought for the Congress in the state, Kamal Nath sanctioned the waiver of farm loans up to 2 lakh rupees in the state, as was promised in the election manifesto, and announced by Congress President Rahul Gandhi in June earlier this year.

Rajesh Rajora, Principal Secretary, Farmers' Welfare and Agriculture Development Department, issued an order soon after which read, "" Madhya Pradesh Government has taken a decision to write off short-term crop loan of eligible farmers up to the limit of Rs two lakh, as on March 31, 2018, from nationalised and cooperative banks."" Rajora said an estimated 34 lakh farmers will benefit from the loan waiver whose size he pegged between Rs 35,000 crore and Rs 38,000 crore.

Gandhi tweeted soon after: ""1 done. 2 to go.""

Chhattisgarh, where Congress won as well, followed next with Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel announcing the waiver of short-term agriculture loans to the tune of over Rs 6100 crore of over 16.65 lakh farmers drawn from cooperative banks and Chhattisgarh Gramin Banks. Fulfilling another pre-poll promise, the cabinet in Chhattisgarh decided to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal.

Upon being asked if loan waiver was the best option to revive the agrarian economy, Kamal Nath, who believes farm loan waivers are ""a necessity"" had a now-familiar tune to sing: When nationalised banks can write off 40-50 percent of loans of big industrialists, why can't cultivators get the same relief? The anger of the rural-dweller has recently manifested in massive farmer protests in the both the national capital and the country's financial hub this year.

One of their most important demands - complete loan waiver. In a year marked by high-profile scams in the banking sector in the country, to the farmer, his demand doesn't sound illogical at all. Loan waivers, whether farm loan or corporate NPAs, both represent a moral hazard, true. That corporate NPAs are a different kettle of fish is not a nuance an angry farmer faced with his dire realities is prepared to understand. And what the farmer dangles before the government is his vote. One wheat farmer in Madhya Pradesh, echoing millions others, said to Reuters: ""I will vote for the party that will write off our loans."" Quid pro quo.

The election results in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh are being read as a rebuke to PM Modi. The Indian Express noted, ""The Congress' relentless pursuit of boxing in the Modi government over agricultural issues seems to have paid off as out of a total of 424 rural seats in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, the BJP won just 153 seats as compared to 294 in 2013 - nearly 50 per cent fewer seats.""

With little time left before the general elections, and to ensure the support of India's 263 million farmers and their dependants, reports indicate that the Modi government may be announcing a massive loan waiver - something it has not done since coming to power - to the tune of about Rs 4 lakh crore ($56.5 billion). Congress Chief Rahul Gandhi, on Tuesday, said that if his party is elected at the centre in 2019, it would waive of all farm loans. Gandhi also said that he ""won't let the Prime Minister sleep"" till a nationwide farm loan waiver is announced. Gandhi's farm-loan-waiver promise has certainly paid the Congress rich dividends this election season.

And with a new governor at the RBI, and the possibility of tapping into the excess capital reserves of the central bank now seeming easier than it did during Urjit Patel's time, it's not hard to see what Modi's next step might be.

In a completely unpredicted development, the theme for the 2019 elections, ladies and gentlemen, is farm loan waivers.

Farm loan waivers - A brief history

Gone are the days of free television sets and gold trinkets. Farm loan waivers, it seems, are the new political currency.

Farmers make up over half the labour market in India and are crucial in elections. The first national loan waivers date back to 1990, when the union government waived Rs 100 billion ($5.6 billion) in farm loans. In 2008, the government announced another major round of loan waivers totalling Rs 650 billion, about 1.3 percent of India's GDP.

Over the following nine years, until 2017, the central and state governments waived nearly Rs 890 billion ($14 billion) in loans to 48 million farmers. Since 2017, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Chhattisgarh have all announced (or completed the promised) farm loan waivers. Tamil Nadu, under Jayalalithaa, had done so in 2016. Karnataka, with a waiver announced of Rs 44,000 crore tops the list, with

Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra following closely behind, each with upwards of 30,000 crore rupees waived. This brand of competitive populism, ahead of 2019, has spread to Gujarat and Assam as recently as today with these states also announcing a waiver of farm loans and electricity bills.

In 2017, waivers announced in the four states of Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Karnataka, came at a cost of $13.6 billion. By 2019, farm loan waivers will amount to 2-2.5 percent of the GDP, or about $40 billion, said BofA-ML last year.

As Nilanjan Banik writes in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), ""Waivers of farm loans may help any political party win an election once. For them to win an election twice, however, it is important to undertake policy measures that will make a real difference to the life of poor farmers.""

What are waivers useful for? Garnering votes. Agriculture employs nearly 45 percent of India's workforce even though its contribution to the GDP is about 15 percent.

Research studies, like Banik's, over several years have indicated over and over again that farm loan waivers are at best a Band-Aid solution and at worst instruments that engender moral hazard. Additionally, formulae to waive farm loans are not uniform across states.

Rajasthan, for example, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings, and harvest volume. Other states have fixed limits for the amount to be waived. The UPA government 2008 waiver covered only marginal and small farmers (those holding less than 2 hectares of land). Others got a 25 percent waiver. On the flipside, many farmers who do own more than 2 hectares of land are rendered ineligible even though much of the land owned may be uncultivated.

From a macroeconomic perspective, ex-RBI Governor Urjit Patel stated that the farm loan waiver scheme ""undermines an honest credit culture, impacts credit discipline, blunts incentives for future borrowers to repay, in other words, waivers engender moral hazard.""

The RBI also warned that loan waivers will crowd out private borrowers in favour of government lenders and will worsen inflationary risks, limiting the RBI's ability to lower interest rates. His predecessor Dr Raghuram Rajan also reiterated this concern and added that the waivers often go to the ""best connected rather than to the poorest.""The Economic Times put it succinctly when it listed seven reasons why farm loan waivers do not make sense:

Politician promises taxpayer money to waive farmer's loans in exchange for his vote. Taxpayer money is then used to repay these loans thus denting the fiscal standing of the government promising these loans. Writing for Firstpost, Dinesh Unnikrishnan says, ""Since banks do not get money on time from governments, this puts them on a back foot, forcing to go slow on further lending to farmers.""

A report from Kotak Institutional Equities pointed to a strong dip in agricultural loans in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh two-three years after the announcement of waivers there. The report adds, ""While the available data does not clearly substantiate our hypothesis given the other extraneous variables like monsoon, other government initiatives, etc., back of the envelope calculations suggest a modest slowdown.

Additionally, agriculture loan growth has been broadly strong in the years prior to the announcement of a loan waiver in most cases apart from Punjab. Additionally, the growth of agriculture loans in these states has been higher than the industry average or their regions prior to the announcement under most circumstances.""

State governments that have announced these waivers have since seen their debt-to-GDP ratio increase, Unnikrishnan points.

Unfortunately, however, agriculture is a season-dependent trade. Should there be another spell of poor rains, or a glut resulting in lower market prices, the farmer is yet again saddled with loans he cannot repay, and yet again, the politician enters to cash the farmer's vote for a waiver.

Who benefits from farm loan waivers, even if for the short term?

Rich upper caste farmers. Or at any rate, farmers with access to formal bank credit, meaning farmers with some functional financial literacy. And politicians seeking power.

The work of C Shankar Rao, assistant professor at the Council for Social Development, Hyderabad, published in the Economic and Political Weekly (EPW), sheds more light on this. More than 85 percent of India's farmers are either small (0.1 to 1 hectare total land farmed) or marginal (1.1 to 2 hectares). Semi-medium to large landowners constitute the remaining 15 percent of the farmer population in the country. This distinction is crucial to understand the debt-seeking patterns within the farmer community.

There are three main sources of credit for farmers: among formal sources, Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) and co-operatives; among informal sources, private money lenders (PMLs).

It should come as no surprise then that small and marginal farmers mostly borrow from PMLs as they are less likely to have anything to offer in terms of collateral to formal sector credit sources. As SCs constitute the largest chunk of small and marginal farmers, it is also them that have the smallest formal sector credit.

More than a fourth of the total credit taken by Indian farmers came at interest rates of 36 percent per annum - clearly interests levied by private money lenders. Upper castes often also have an advantage accessing cooperative credit, research has gone to show.

(It is to be noted, however, that rich SC farmers, too, do better when it comes to accessing formal credit.)

Nilanjan Banik in the EPW again: ""Loan waivers are not the solution to the farming crisis. In the year following loan waivers, small farmers lose out on three counts: lower access to formal loans, falling agricultural revenue because of higher informal loan cost, and falling agricultural productivity.""

The Times of India reported the stories of several farmers from across the country who were eligible for waivers but eventually only ended up receiving a fraction of what was promised owing to the fine print in these loan waiver schemes.

Simply put, farm loan waivers are only helpful to those who have taken loans from a formal credit source. 85 percent of the country's farmer population constitutes of small and marginal farmers, a large section of whom most often do not even have access to formal bank credit and are at the mercy of private money lenders who levy exorbitant interest rates.

Even more simply put, loan waivers impact those who are in the system. The tragedy though is that the section of the farmer population that is in direst need of help is out of the system and therefore stands to gain nothing.

PRS Legislative Research reiterated this point: ""Marginal and small farmers accounted for 82 percent of all indebted households and 56 percent of the outstanding loans by value. However, only a small proportion of the indebted marginal and small farmers had taken loans from institutional sources such as banks and cooperatives.

Informal sources such as moneylenders, family and friends accounted for 62 percent of indebted households among marginal farmers. Such farmers would not benefit from any scheme that restructures debt taken from banks and cooperatives.""

How does it impact the economy?

The fiscal standing of the governments granting these waivers suffers as a result of loan waiver schemes. Tanika Chakraborty and Aarti Gupta of IIT Kanpur, presenting their research in Ideas for India, went on to note: ""Our research provides evidence that a blanket waiver scheme is detrimental to the development of credit markets.

Repeated debt-waiver programmes distort households' incentive structures, away from productive investments and towards unproductive consumption and wilful defaults. These wilful defaults, in turn, are likely to disrupt the functioning of the entire credit system.""

Let's examine the impact on banks first. In the aftermath of every loan waiver announcement, a spike in NPAs has been observed, simply because even honest taxpayers stop repayments in the hope that their liabilities too might get included in the waiver package. A Kotak Institutional Equities report states an example: ""As we saw in Karnataka, gross NPLs in MP have been rising in recent years. It was at 8 percent in FY2017 which increased to 11 percent prior to the elections."" That phrase again - moral hazard. Moral hazard, which incentivises defaulting on loans. In Dec 2017, The Times of India reported that in some states, the default rate had increased by up to 50 percent in the aftermath of a loan waiver announcement. HFDC Bank reported a 60 percent rise in agricultural loan delinquencies in the quarter ending June 30, 2017.

Public sector banks (PSBs) will be the most negatively affected by the loan waivers. As of 2017, Nomura estimated that state-owned banks hold two-thirds of loans to be waived. The loan waivers would further exacerbate the PSBs asset quality problems and their already weakened capital levels.

The Hindu Business Line noted, ""Economists caution that farm loans waivers would widen a fiscal deficit the government has aimed to cap at 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), or Rs 6.24 lakh crore. Even without the farm loan waiver, some credit rating agencies have estimated the country's fiscal deficit at Rs 6.67 lakh crore - or 3.5 percent of GDP, on muted tax collections. The loan waiver also risks deepening the malaise at public sector banks saddled with most of India's $150 billion in stressed loans.""

In its 2016-2017 annual report, the central bank cautioned against such ""unconditional bailouts"", saying they could affect fiscal credibility in the medium term. The report also noted that the benefits of the waivers were ""highly skewed and concentrated in states where concentration of land holdings was low on account of land reforms."" It added that such random policy shocks ""have an enduring impact on market borrowings of governments, as evident from past episodes of such waivers. They increase the interest rates the governments need to pay for the loans they borrow.""

As for states granting these waivers, some have already seen their fiscal deficits worsen due to the impact of the UDAY (Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana) scheme, which passed on a part of the debt burden of state electricity distribution companies onto the state government. Compromises on productive spending are inevitable - something's gotta give. The states' fiscal deficit widens, as has already been seen. As per the RBI, the gross fiscal deficit (GFD) rose to 3.1 percent breaching the threshold of 3 percent GFD/GSDP ratio recommended by the Finance Commission.

What then are the alternatives to farm loan waivers?

In a nutshell, it is safe to say that farm loan waivers are nothing more than a temporary dike made of mud in the face of a deluge of problems faced by the agrarian sector. It is no more than a populist ploy aimed at getting votes. As P Sainath said, ""waivers are merely a tool, not a transformation; mechanism not a solution; relief not an answer to the greater problem.""

M S Swaminathan, Father of the Green Revolution, said in an interview to Al Jazeera, ""Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary for the revival of farming, do not provide conditions for a secure credit system in the long term.""

Even in large scale reforms, patience is a virtue. It is beyond any doubt that India finds herself in the grip of an agrarian crisis. But the need of the hour is thoughtful long-term planning. Surgery, not band-aids. To incorporate the many reforms that have been suggested is beyond the scope of this piece, and will therefore be dealt with on a follow-up piece, but let's take a quick look at some of them.

Many experts have suggested the implementation of the National Commission on Farmers (NCF). Chaired by M S Swaminathan, it recommended minimum support price for grains, protection of small farmers and addressing risks in overtaking agriculture as a profession. The commission observed that farmers need to have access over resources such as land, water, bio-resources, credit and insurance, technology and markets and that agriculture needs to be shifted to the concurrent list instead of the state list at which it is currently at.

Nilanjan Banik wrote about some reforms from a cost-benefit perspective. He wrote, ""The government can spend money for building more canals and warehouses, on rural electrification, and to operate more e-markets. Each one of these interventions comes with a cost and an associated benefit. As an economist, one would argue government should spend each additional rupee to alleviate farm distress in a way where the impact is more, with a higher benefit-to-cost ratio.""

Noting that 20 percent of India's fresh produce is wasted because of storage problems, he advocated the building of more warehouses and storage facilities. ""The National Centre for Cold Chain Development (NCCD) has estimated Rajasthan's total requirement for storing milk, fruits and vegetables at 74,889 tonnes.

Providing pack houses and trucks would cost ₹5,985 crore. The benefits in terms of the reduced wastage in milk, fruits and vegetables, are worth more than 15 times that figure."" Research also shows that e-markets could result in better prices for farmers. A similar view was echoed by researchers at ICRIER.

Fragmented land holding, depletion of water table level, poor irrigation systems, deteriorating soil quality, rising input costs and diminishing returns, the vagaries of monsoon... these are only a few of the issues faced by the Indian farmer, none of which are truly addressed by loan waivers. What loan waivers do is address a temporary problem with a temporary, and largely ineffective, solution.

For effective long term reform, and to realise the government's dream of doubling farmer income by 2022, policymakers ought to think beyond electoral politics and enact structural changes that go beyond election season rhetoric and populist schemes.

The recent farmer protests seen in Mumbai and New Delhi hint at another crisis within the agrarian community - a crisis of identity. The socio-economic transformation that India has seen post-liberalisation has largely been felt in urban India. The traditional dominance of the farming community is being threatened in the new economic order where formal education and jobs matter more than farm incomes do.

Adding to the crisis of collective identity is an epidemic of mental health disorders. Farmer suicides are tragic, this is undeniable. And most narratives tend to cite poor farm outcomes and burgeoning loans as the reasons for these suicides, sidestepping another brewing crisis within the agrarian community - that of clinical depression.

For the record, as of 2011, the latest year for which suicide data were computed, suicide mortality is lower among farmers than non-farmers (Basu, Das and Misra, EPW, 2016). Dr Neeraj Kaushal, Professor of Social Policy at Columbia School of Social Work, has gone on to note that while the economic distress of a poor harvest may no doubt contribute to the farmer suicides, it is also just as important to address the mental health problems that the community may be suffering from, but is too afraid to address.

Any reform in the agrarian sector would be incomplete if it didn't also consider the well-being - physical and mental - of the agriculturist.Jai Jawaan Jai Kisaan, otherwise, would be merely lip service."

'This needs a greater amount of investigation, research and mapping in the country.'

Mohammed Dilawar, the ornithologist known as India's sparrow man, is happy that Rajinikanth's latest movie 2.0 highlights the issue of birds and how cell phone tower radiation affects their existence.

""The movie has highlighted the importance of birds's lives and I am sure people across the country will take this issue seriously in future because Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar have highlighted the importance of birds to our lives,"" Dilawar tells Rediff.com's Syed Firdaus Ashraf.

2.0 shows that birds are dying because of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from cell phone towers. How far is it true?

There has been research done abroad which says there is some kind of impact on birds due to cell phone towers. I was part of a committee that looked into this issue 10 years ago.

The committee was constituted by the ministry of environment and forests to find out the impact of cell phones on birds, bees and wildlife in India.

A lot of literature review was done then and it was found that the decline of sparrows in cities is not only because of cell phone towers. There are other reasons also, like lack of food and pesticides which led to a decline in the number of sparrows.

as a scientist I would not comment on it until detailed research is done, in which mapping of cell phone towers and bird population is done across the country.

So your report was not conclusive in stating that cell phone tower radiation was the only reason for the decline in the bird population.

There is no long-term study being done in India on this issue. Also, in India, there are various variables which differ from one region to other region.

For example, the bird density, the kind of landscape that we have and the kind of technology which we use (differs from region to region), but certainly electromagnetic radiation or EMR is a kind of pollution which is invisible.

You cannot see it the way you see smog in Mumbai or Delhi or, for that matter, water pollution where water changes colour.

Is there anywhere in the world where research has found that birds are dying because of cell phone tower radiation?

It is not exactly about death, but about impact.

For example, research by Ruiz-Martinez in Spain concluded that as the radiation of cell phone towers increase, the bird population decreases.

As the human population decreases, bird population increases.

So the number of cell phone towers with 4G technology might certainly impact the lives of birds, and of humans. This needs a greater amount of investigation, research and mapping in the country.

Is it true that bird eggs get deformed because of cell phone tower radiation?

Electromagnetic radiation might affect egg formation at times, but again, they are the same set of radiation which is there in a microwave oven.

With 4G technology coming in, we need to have a greater study and understanding about this issue.

Is no one interested in studying this even after 10 years of your research?

Unfortunately, the issue of electromagnetic radiation has not got due justice.

As a scientist, whether it impacts birds, humans or not is a totally different story, but at least we have to carry out a study and find out whether the electromagnetic radiation is within permissible limits or not.

The cell phone tower association says it is always within permissible limits.

As a scientist, I say that we need to have a complete mapping of electromagnetic radiation in the country. If it is in permissible limit that is wonderful, but there always has to be measurement.

How we have various measurements in metros to measure air quality and the moment particulate matters of pollution rises the alarm bill rings in a city. People try to solve problems of pollution by, say, starting an odd and even day car system in Delhi.

This kind of monitoring must also be done for electromagnetic radiation as it is an emerging pollutant which is invisible.

Lots of times the common man is not aware that electromagnetic radiation is also under the pollution category.

Is there any study in India which says the bird population is decreasing because of cell phone tower radiation?

The population of birds has been steadily decreasing across the landscape of the world. But this is for various reasons, like habitat destruction, increasing number of bird catchings, etc.

In fact, if you google you will find out that we have lost 80 percent of wildlife and birds in the last 60 years.

Electromagnetic radiation is also one of the reasons just like micro plastic found in water. At this point in time habitat destruction is also due to poor water quality.

Why is serious thought not given to this issue?

It is because EMR is invisible pollution.

It is like out of sight, out of mind, even if there are various citizens groups in India like by actress Juhi Chawla who is running a campaign against cell phone towers. Humans too are getting affected because of cell phone towers.

The courts have given judgment in favour of cell phone towers. The matter has now gone before the Supreme Court.

I will not comment on the case since it is sub judice. But I'd like to thank Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar for raising the birds issue in 2.0,.

It is a wonderful sign. This has brought a once forgotten pollutant back in the limelight.

If you see, on every cell phone tower they install warning signals that harmful radiation is emitting. It is by law.

You have been conducting research on sparrows extensively. Did you find that cell phone tower radiation is the cause of the decline in ther sparrow population?

Unfortunately, in the case of sparrows, all emerging threats came at one time, whether it was electromagnetic radiation or architectural changes in our building construction style or change in the lifestyle of Indian women.

Earlier, older buildings used to have a cavity in their structures which was used by sparrows to nest, but now the buildings are matchbox shaped and don't leave space for sparrows to make a home.

As far as women are concerned, they used to clean grains on balconies or in verandahs where they would discard poor quality grains. These grains were a major food source for these birds. Now they don't get such food as lifestyles have changed.

Can the sparrow become extinct?

No. Fortunately, we have good numbers of sparrows in the rural landscape and certain urban patches.

Birds become extinct when only a few hundred individuals are left. That is not the case for sparrows at the moment."

From the historic thawing of the Korean standoff, Donald Trump's political ups and downs, killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi, to the royal wedding, here is a recap of all that was 2018:

'Feel Like a Free Bird'- Saudi Allows Women to Drive

Saudi women took the wheel with gusto this year, steering their way through the busy city streets minutes after the decades-old ban on women drivers was lifted in the country on 24 June.

This came as a culmination of years of campaigning by activists and feminists against the driving ban. While the ban itself has been lifted, the Kingdom is nevertheless prosecuting those who campaigned for its end.

Samar Almogren, a talkshow host and writer, had said: ""I always knew this day would come. But it came fast. Sudden. I feel free like a bird.""

Justice, the 'American Way' - US Missile Attack in Syria

Facing his biggest foreign policy crisis since taking office, US President Trump took the toughest direct US action yet in Syria's six-year civil war, with the military launching cruise missile strikes against a Syrian airbase controlled by President Bashar al-Assad's forces.

The attack, that left nine people dead, including four children, saw 59 Tomahawk missiles launched from US Navy warships in the Mediterranean Sea.

""America stands for justice. Years of previous attempts at changing Assad's behaviour have failed. It is in the vital national security interest of the US to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,"" Trump said in a satatement after the attack.

A Terrifying Double Disaster - Indonesia Quakes

Earlier this year, a series of powerful quakes hit Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people on the holiday island and neighbouring Sumbawa.

The death toll in Indonesia's quake-tsunami disaster nearly doubled to the initial hit, leaving more than 800 dead. Ill-equipped rescuers struggled to reach scores of trapped victims, as health officials resorted to mass burials and desperate residents looted shops for food and water.

Indonesia is one of the world's most disaster-prone nations. It lies on the Pacific ""Ring of Fire"", where tectonic plates collide and many of the world's volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.

'No Remorse' - Bill Cosby Arrested

His Hollywood career and good-guy image in ruins, an 81-year-old Bill Cosby was sentenced on Tuesday, 25 September, to three to 10 years behind bars for drugging and sexually assaulting a woman, becoming the first celebrity of the #MeToo era to be sent to prison.

The punishment all but completed the dizzying, late-in-life fall for the comedian, former TV star and breaker of racial barriers.

Prosecutors had asked a US court to sentence Cosby to 5-10 years for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, saying he had shown ""no remorse"" for his actions.

'Mine (Nuclear Button) is Much Bigger Than His' - Trump Meets Kim

After months of speculation and U-turns, US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had a 'successful' one-on-one talk at Singapore's Sentosa island on 12 June.

Trump summed up the summit saying that the two countries have an ""excellent relationship"", as Kim committed to 'complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula' in a joint 'comprehensive document' signed between the two countries.

Earlier in the year, Trump had boasted that his nuclear button was ""much bigger"" and ""more powerful"" than the North Korean leader's.

Wedding Royale - Harry Marries Meghan

Britain's Prince Harry and American actress Meghan Markle were pronounced husband and wife on 19 May by the Archbishop of Canterbury in a glittering union that brought a measure of modern Hollywood glamour into the 1,000-year-old monarchy.

The newlyweds are now known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, putting them in the senior ranks of British royalty.

The world's media was gripped by the occasion, and television channels beamed the ceremony across the world.

To some Britons, the wedding of a senior member of the royal family to a divorcee whose mother is African-American and father is white embodied a modern Britain where race or background are no bar to even the most elite and traditional of institutions.

California Wildfires

A massive wildfire that killed dozens of people and destroyed thousands of homes wreaked havoc in Northern California this year. The fire was fully contained after burning for more than two weeks on 25 November.

The nation's deadliest wildfire in a century killed at least 85 people, and 249 are on a list of those unaccounted for.

The fire began on 8 November, in the parched Sierra Nevada foothills and quickly spread across 240 square miles (620 square kilometers), destroying most of Paradise in a day.

'Queen of Soul' No More - Aretha Franklin Passes Away

Aretha Franklin, the former gospel singer who went on to reign over the music industry as the Queen of Soul with hit songs such as ""Respect,"" ""Chain of Fools"" and ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" died in August this year. She was 76.

Franklin died of pancreatic cancer at her home in Detroit. In March, Franklin had canceled a scheduled tour for medical reasons. Her last known performance was at Elton John's annual AIDS Foundation gala.

'Stand With Saudi' - Khashoggi Killing

On 2 October, Jamal Khashoggi, a well-known journalist and critic of the Saudi government, walked into the country's consulate in Istanbul, where he was murdered.

Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor has since said that Khashoggi was killed inside the building on the orders of a rogue intelligence officer.

But what was even more bizarre was US President Donald Trump's take on the killing.

""[I]t could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event - maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"" Trump wrote in a statement. ""We may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.""

Trump refused to see his killing, an event that brought international condemnation of Saudis, as a reason to sever or weaken ties with Riyadh.

""The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,"" he said.

No Judge-ment - Kavanaugh Hearing

Brett Kavanaugh was sworn in on 6 October as the 114th justice of the US Supreme Court, after a wrenching debate over sexual misconduct and judicial temperament that shattered the Senate, captivated the nation and ushered in an acrimonious new level of polarization - now encroaching on the court that the 53-year-old judge may well swing rightward for decades to come.

The climactic 50-48 roll call capped a fight that seized the national conversation after claims emerged that he had sexually assaulted women three decades ago - allegations he emphatically denied.

Those accusations transformed the clash from a routine struggle over judicial ideology into an angry jumble of questions about victims' rights, the presumption of innocence and personal attacks on nominees.

'Don't Panic!' - SpaceX Falcon Heavy Launch

Elon Musk's SpaceX pulled off a seemingly impossible feat in February this year when it launched the world's most powerful rocket in 45 years, then flew two of its spent boosters back to the Florida coast for a spectacular, simultaneous recovery on land.

Musk then pulled off something perhaps even more surprising - he delivered a cherry red Tesla Roadster with a space-suit wearing mannequin at the wheel toward an Earth-Mars elliptical orbit around the sun.

On the car's center screen, Musk's team had written, ""DON'T PANIC!"", seemingly a message for the 'spaceman'.

""It seems surreal to me,"" Musk, 46, had said during a post-launch press conference. ""Crazy things can come true.""

'Mind Over Matter' - Stephen Hawking Passes Away

Veteran physicist, cosmologist and professor Stephen Hawking breathed his last on Wednesday, 14 March, leaving behind a black hole in the mortal world.

Hawking, who was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) at the age of 21, was told by his doctors that he would only live for two more years. Like every other standardised theory he had a problem with, Hawking decided to challenge and make a breakthrough in this one as well, and went on to create scientific history till the ripe old age of 76.

While Hawking has been the poster-man for and inspiration behind every science club formed in school, with his personal journey of struggling through his disability to making way towards greatness marking every inspirational textbook, Hawking's identity goes far beyond that of a kind of 'Science Lord' awarded to him by his fans.

Zero Tolerance, Zero Humanity - US Cages Immigrant Children

Nearly 2,000 children were taken from their parents after former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a policy which directed homeland security officials to refer all cases of illegal entry into the US for prosecution.

Church groups and human rights advocates had sharply criticized Donald Trump's policy, calling it inhumane.

Stories had also spread of children being torn from their parents' arms, and parents not being able to find where their kids have gone.

Bowing to pressure from anxious allies, Trump had signed an executive order on 20 June, ending the process of separating children from families after they are detained crossing the US border illegally.

Canada's Cannabis Experiment

Canada approved a revised bill to legalise recreational marijuana in June this year, setting the stage for the country to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalise cannabis.

The Senate voted 52-29 in favor of the revised bill, paving the way for a fully legal cannabis market within eight to 12 weeks.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals had made legalising recreational use of marijuana part of their successful 2015 election campaign, arguing the new law would keep pot out of the hands of underage users and reduce related crime.

""It's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits. Today, we change that. Our plan to legalise & regulate marijuana just passed the Senate,"" Trudeau said in a tweet.

Sacre Bleu! - France Lift WC

Taking turns sliding across the rain-soaked turf holding the World Cup trophy tight, teenager Kylian Mbappe and the rest of France's players acted like the youthful bunch they are.

The celebrations carried on long after a thrilling 4-2 win over Croatia in the final, which saw Mbappe score.

Paul Pogba and Griezmann, France's two other key creative players, also scored.

'This Has Got to End' - Yemen Starves

At an apparent turning point in one of its hardest foreign policy challenges, the Trump administration is demanding a cease-fire and the launch of UN-led political talks to end the Saudi-Iran proxy war in Yemen. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis called for a halt to hostilities within 30 days.

""This has got to end. We've got to replace combat with compromise,"" Mattis said.

The conflict in Yemen began with the 2014 takeover of the capital, Sanaa, and the toppling of the government by the Houthis, a Shiite Muslim minority in the country. The Saudi-led coalition allied with the government has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.

An estimated 10,000 people have been killed. The war has also left around two-thirds of Yemen's population of 27 million relying on aid, and more than 8 million at risk of starvation.

Brexit, May I? - Theresa May Struggles to Execute Deal

Facing almost certain defeat, British Prime Minister Theresa May recently postponed a vote in Parliament on her Brexit deal, saying she would go back to European Union leaders to seek changes to the divorce agreement.

May's move threw Britain's Brexit plans into disarray, intensified a domestic political crisis and battered the pound. With EU officials adamant the withdrawal deal was not up for renegotiation, the country does not know on what terms it will leave -- and whether May will still be Britain's leader when it does.

In an emergency statement to the House of Commons, May accepted that the divorce deal she struck last month with EU leaders was likely to be rejected ""by a significant margin"" if the vote were held as planned.

Historic Korea Summit

South Korean President Moon Jae-in arrived in North Korea in September for his third and possibly most challenging summit yet with leader Kim Jong-un in which he hopes to break an impasse in talks with the United States over the North's denuclearisation and breathe energy into his own efforts to expand and improve relations between the Koreas.

In what are by now familiar images of the two Korean leaders hugging and exchanging warm smiles, Kim greeted Moon at Pyongyang's airport. They have met twice this year at the border village of Panmunjom, but Moon's visit is the first by a South Korean leader to the North Korean capital in 11 years.

George Bush Senior Passes Away

George HW Bush, a patrician New Englander whose presidency soared with the coalition victory over Iraq in Kuwait, but then plummeted in the throes of a weak economy that led voters to turn him out of office after a single term, has died. He was 94.

The World War II hero, who also presided during the collapse of the Soviet Union and the final months of the Cold War, died late Friday night, 30 November, at his Houston home, said family spokesperson Jim McGrath.

'Won't Happen in a Men's Match' - Serena Williams' Press Conference

Serena Williams accused an umpire of sexism and treating her more harshly than men as she used a press conference to double down on her earlier on-court tirade at the official during her US Open final defeat to Japan's Naomi Osaka.

Williams was cited by official Carlos Ramos for three code violations during her 6-2, 6-4 loss to the 20-year-old Osaka.

But despite the match penalties, she renewed her attack at a media conference later.

""For me, it blows my mind. But I'm going to continue to fight for women.""

Setback for Trump - US Mid-term Elections

Democrats won the US House by riding a surge of voter anger and discontent with Donald Trump in suburban enclaves, even as the president's loyal supporters reaffirmed Republican control of the Senate.

The outcome of the US midterm election highlighted the urban-rural divide that has come to define US politics. It will dramatically alter Trump's next two years in office and make a deeply divided nation even more difficult to govern as he seeks re-election in 2020.

'I Want it All' - Anthony Bourdain No More

Many people thought Anthony Bourdain had the most enviable career in existence. He didn't deny it.

""I have the best job in the world,"" the globe-trotting food-taster and culinary storyteller once told the New Yorker magazine, stating the rather obvious. ""If I'm unhappy, it's a failure of imagination.""

Bourdain's stunned fans were left mourning the loss of that singular imagination in June this year following his death from an apparent suicide, recalling everything from his fearless consumption of a beating cobra's heart or a sheep testicle - ""like any other testicle,"" he had remarked - to his outspoken support of the #MeToo movement, to his blissful paean to syrup-soaked pecan waffles at Waffle House.

'Everyone is Safe' - Thai Cave Rescue

""Everyone is safe."" With those three words posted on Facebook the daring rescue mission to extricate 12 boys and their soccer coach from the treacherous confines of a flooded cave in Thailand was complete - a grueling 18-day ordeal that claimed the life of an experienced diver and riveted people worldwide.

Thailand's Navy SEALs, who were central to the rescue effort, celebrated the feat with a post that read: ""All the thirteen Wild Boars are now out of the cave,"" - a reference to the boys' soccer team. ""We are not sure if this is a miracle, a science, or what.""

When Facebook 'Zucked' US Congress

Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg navigated through US congressional hearings in April without making any further promises to support new legislation or change how the social network makes money.

During nearly five hours of questioning by 44 US senators, Zuckerberg repeated apologies he previously made for a range of problems that have beset Facebook, from a lack of data protection to Russian agents using Facebook to influence US elections.

But the 33-year-old internet mogul managed to deflect any specific promises to support any congressional regulation of the world's largest social media network and other US internet companies.

Scheduled Tribes Component across all Ministries witnesses a substantial increase from Rs. 31,920.00 Cr. in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 37,802.94 Cr in 2018-19. Government announces important measures to revamp and expand scheme of setting up EMRSs; 462 new EMRSs to be set up Launch of Van Dhan Yojana by Prime Minister to improve income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people Two National level and four state level museums to celebrate contribution of tribal freedom fighters being set up

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of Scheduled Tribes. The Scheduled Tribes comprise about 8.6% of India's population (according to the 2011 census). In the year 2018, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs focused on education of tribal people, new initiatives to substantially step up economic empowerment of the tribal population as well as bring into spotlight the tribal culture by constructing museums to highlight the tribal freedom fighters. A very major thrust this year has been on revamping and overhauling the prominent scheme of setting up of Eklaya Model Residential Schools to expand the reach of good quality education among the tribal persons.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs has continued with its endeavours for socio-economic development of Scheduled Tribes (STs) through specially tailored schemes for education, infrastructure and livelihood to fill in critical gaps. Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) of Government now mandates this Ministry to monitor 'Tribal Sub-Plan' (now recoined as 'Scheduled Tribe Component') funds of Central Ministries based on the framework and mechanism propounded by NITI Aayog. In order to consistently improve public service delivery, Ministry of Tribal Affairs constantly reviews various schematic initiatives, recent ones being rationalization of scholarship schemes besides on boarding of same on DBT platform and online portal for NGO Grants.

Budget allocation of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has gone up from Rs. 5329.32 Crore in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 5957.18 Cr in 2018-19. Ministry has already utilized 74.69% of its allocated outlay on various developmental initiatives for STs. An amount of Rs. 2385.90 Cr (as on 09 December, 2018) has been released under two Special Areas Programme of the Ministry viz. Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme and Grants under Article 275(1) of the Constitution for Education, Health, Livelihood/Income Generation Activities etc. Similarly, allocation for Scheduled Tribes Component across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 31,920.00 Cr in the year 2017-18 to Rs. 37,802.94 Cr in 2018-19.

With implementation of Public Financial Management System (PFMS), efficiency in funds allocation and monitoring its release has been improved besides enhancing transparency and accountability. All agencies receiving funds from the Ministry have been on boarded in the system. This facilitates real-time tracking of fund utilization by implementing agencies.

MONITORING OF FUNDS FOR TRIBAL DEVELOPMENT

Allocation of Business Rules (ABR) amended in January, 2017 has mandated the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) for monitoring of STC funds of Central Ministries. An online monitoring system has been put in place by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs with web address http://stcmis.gov.in for monitoring of Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP)/Schedule Tribe Component (STC) funds. The framework captures data directly from Public Finance Management System (PFMS) and provides inputs to see through expenditure vis-a- vis allocations. Monitoring of physical performance and outcome of initiatives has also been introduced in the system. A customized proforma has also been developed in MIS to capture location of ongoing projects and beneficiary details. Further, Nodal Officer have been designated in line Ministries/Departments for coordination and monitoring. Required credentials are shared with nodal officers for uploading data regarding output and outcome. Review meetings are held regularly for effective monitoring.

There are 37 Central Ministries and Departments having STC funds catering to specific tribal development in various sectors through 299 different schemes, as reflected in the Statement 10B of the Expenditure Profile of the Budget, 2018-19. Allocation for welfare of Scheduled Tribes across all Ministries has witnessed an increase from Rs. 24,005.00 crore in financial year 2016-17 to Rs. 31,920.00 crore in financial year 2017-18 and Rs. 37,802.94 crore in 2018-19. With the efforts of Ministry of Tribal Affairs, the STC expenditure has gone up from 85% of total allocation at Revised Estimate stage in 2016-17 to 96% in 2017-18. During 2018-19, out of total allocation of Rs. 37,802.94 crore, an amount of Rs. 23,772.05 crore has already been released as on 09.12.2018, which is 62.88% of the total allocation.

As far as State TSP funds are concerned, vigorous efforts of MoTA has resulted in 98% increase in expenditure of State Tribal Sub-Plan funds by States during the years block of 2010-13 (wherein a total of Rs. 1,65,691.00 crore was expended) to 2014-17 (wherein a total of Rs. 3,27,574.00 crore were expended).""

As on 09.12.2018, 63% of the total allocated STC amount has been released by different Central Ministries / Departments against various development projects relating to education, health, agriculture, irrigation, roads, housing, electrification, employment generation, skill development etc.

SCHEME FOR EKLAVYA MODEL RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (EMRS)

Eklavya Model Residential School is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. The scheme aims to bridge the gap in literacy level between the general population and tribal population.

A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Accordingly, it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

It has also been decided to set up an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs.

The recurring cost has also been enhanced from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

The CCEA decision also spells out reservation of 20% seats under sports quota and 10% for non-ST students.

An outlay of Rs. 118.65 Crore has been made to various states under the scheme Special Central Assistance to Tribal Sub-Scheme (SCA to TSS) and Grants under Article 275(1) for skill development of more than 31,000 male and female tribal beneficiaries in a wide gamut of trades such as (i) Planning and Management including office management (ii) Solar Technician / Electrician (iii) Beautician (iv) Handicraft (v) Skills required for day to day construction works (such as Plumbing, Mason, Electrician, Fitter, Welder, Carpenter (vi) Refrigeration and A/C repairing (vii) Mobile repairing (viii) Nutrition (x) Ayurvedic & tribal medicines (xi) IT (xii) Data Entry (xiii) Fabrication (xiv) Paramedics and Home Nurse Training (xv) Automobile Driving and Mechanics (xvi) Electric & Motor Winding (xvii) Security Guard (xviii) Housekeeping & Management (xix) Retail Management (xx) Hospitality (xxi) Eco-tourism (xxii) Adventure Tourism.

CONSTRUCTION OF MUSEUMS FOR TRIBAL FREEDOM FIGHTERS

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

AADI MAHOTSAV

Ministry of Tribal Affairs organized a National Tribal Festival named as 'Aadi Mahotsava' from 16November, 2018 to 30 November, 2018 with the help of TRIFED to celebrate, cherish and promote the spirit of tribal craft, culture, cuisine and commerce at Delhi Haat, INA. This festival was inaugurated by Sh Jual Oram, Hon'ble Minister of Tribal Affairs.

More than 1000 Artisans from 20 States, 80 Tribal Chefs and 14 Dance Troupes comprising more than 250 Artists participated in the Mahotsav. Highlights of the Mahotsav were - Live demos for traditional tribal food and drink; Lac bangles; demo for 4 different schools of painting i.e. Warli, Pithora, Gond and Saura; Fashion show for tribal textiles, fashion accessories etc. Tribal products displayed at Mahotsav included heritage collection of Sarees, Men's collection including cotton, woollen and silk Jackets, Kurtas from MP, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; Bell Metal from Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh; Paintings from Gujrat, Maharashtra, Odisha and MP; Woollens from HP, Uttaranchal and J&K; Honey, spices dry fruits etc. from different States; Tribal Jewellery from Himachal, Odisha, North-East, MP, Telangana; Pottery from Manipur, Rajasthan; Home Furnishing from Rajasthan, North East, MP, UP; Bags collection from Gujrat, Telangana, Jharkhand; and Grass Mat and Coir collection from West Bengal, Jharkhand and Kerala.

At the closing ceremony of the National Tribal Festival, Hon'ble Tribal Affairs Minister Shri Jual Oram felicitated tribal sportswoman - Ms. Mary Kom, for her extraordinary achievement of 6th time Women's World Boxing Champion at Dilli Haat on 30th November, 2018, who is also Brand Ambassador for TRIBES India (Punchtantra range of products) .

It has also been proposed that National Tribal Festivals shall be conducted in 17 States/ Union territories up to March, 2019 to provide a broad platform to highlight tribal culture across India.

NGO GRANTS

Implementation of Online application system ""NGO Grants Online Application & Tracking System"" (www.ngograntsmota.gov.in) activated for processing NGO proposals under the scheme of ""Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for welfare of Scheduled Tribes"" has resulted in quicker information flow and smoother implementation of the scheme besides increasing the number of applications.

MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE FOR MINOR FOREST PRODUCE

The scheme for 'Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP"" (known as MSP for MFPin short) was launched in the year 2013-14 and it then covered only ten MFP items and was applicable to the Schedule V States only. Subsequently, in October 2016 the extent and coverage of the scheme was increased by adding more MFP items and also rendering the scheme applicable country wide. The MSP of ten items that were originally incorporated into the scheme were further revised in November 2017. The issues of further expanding the list of MFP items as also further revising the MSP of the existing MFP items are being considered by the Ministry."

S Jyothsana, 13, a student of Morarji Desai Residential School, was the only daughter of Shankarappa and Vijayamma, residents of Bisanahalli. Shankarappa is an agriculturist and Vijayamma a homemaker.

The school, which comes under the government's social welfare department, has 162 students from classes 6 to 10.

Minutes after Jyothsana went to the toilet, the roof and the walll collapsedstudents said. ""We called the emergency service and started clearing the debris to trace the girl,"" school authorities said. With multiple injuries, Jyothsana was rushed to a local hospital where she succumbed, police said.

K Rathnaiah, DDPI Kolar, inspected the school building and confirmed poor quality of construction.

""It's a rented structure and the owner had constructed six toilets by raising the compound wall. The foundation of the newly constructed wall and roof were weak,"" he said, adding, ""We will file a police complaint against the owner for the poor work.""

Principal MV Bharathi said initially the school was to come up at Devarayasamudra, near Kolar. ""But It was shifted here as the building at Devarayasamudra was not in good condition.

Pics/Sayyed Sameer Abedi

If you have ever been on SV Road at Santacruz around noon, you must have seen the yellow school buses with Podar Education Complex labelled on either side. These are parked along both sides of the road leading to the RN Podar School. The chaos when school is over brings the traffic to a standstill for about an hour on weekdays, a problem that has persisted for many years.

As the school hours of Lilavatibai Podar School and R N Podar School both end within few minutes of each other, the space left after the buses are parked along the footpaths, is occupied by students catching with each other before going home. The primary section at RN Podar School ends at 12.15 pm and the secondary school ends just a few minutes later. Amidst this, are parents who arrive on their scooters, in auto-rickshaws and even in private cars to pick up their children, adding to the chaos. Due to the lack of space on the footpaths, many parents have no choice but to stand in the middle of the road while looking for their child.

Students leaving for the day chat with friends, adding to traffic issues

One-way road adds to chaos

The road between RN Podar and Lilavatibai Podar School is known as Andrews Road. Vehicles can only move in one direction on it. Many vehicle drivers, especially autos and two-wheeler riders can be seen disregarding traffic rules as they try to navigate their way through the crowd of students. Apart from the traffic congestion that creates a problem for parents, local residents, shop keepers as well as motorists just passing through the area, the safety of the children is also an issue. On the road adjacent to RN Podar School, the building that previously was the Podar International School is currently being re-developed. On December 11, a few workers could be seen lifting a massive grille from the ground. The grille dangled just above a school bus which had students sitting inside. Despite being a hazard, none of the school staff on the road seemed bothered by it.

Solutions proposed

Every school has been mandated to form a transport committee that has proposed and implemented solutions to the traffic issues. The school's principal Avnita Bir said that a transport committee which includes members of the PTA has been constituted. The committee meets with the transport department and the traffic police once every six months to find solutions to the traffic issues in the area. ""Letters from the PTA have been sent to the traffic police department repeatedly in the past and for some time they would block the road during dispersal hours. But then a few months ago, they opened the road to the traffic again. While we have the co-operation of the traffic police, it is also our responsibility to ensure easy movement on the road, and our system and guards deal with the traffic,"" Bir said."

Prevalence of obesity and growth in health consciousness have increased the adoption of fitness equipment. Furthermore, rise in the number of gym memberships, in-home equipment sales, growth in urban population, and certain government initiatives fuel the adoption of fitness equipment. One of the factors that could limits the growth opportunity is the high price of the fitness equipment. However, improvement in lifestyle, increase in youth population, and rise in per-capita income in developing countries are anticipated to ensure the overall market growth.

The global fitness equipment market is segmented based on type, user, and region. Based on type, it is categorized into cardiovascular training equipment, strength training equipment, and others. Cardiovascular training equipment is expected to dominate the market, in terms of value, throughout the forecast period on account of its greater penetration in the developed markets such as, the U.S. and Europe and the relatively higher prices over strength equipment. Users for fitness equipment are home consumer, health clubs/gym, and other commercial users. Other commercial users are further classified into hotels, corporate offices, hospital & medical centers, and public institutions. The health club/gym segment is expected to lead the market throughout the analysis period owing to the significant rise in the number of health clubs and memberships.

Based on region, the market is studied across North America (U.S., Canada, and Mexico), Europe (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Benelux, and rest of Europe), Asia-Pacific (Japan, Korea, China, India, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Vietnam, Australia, Malaysia, and rest of Asia-Pacific), and Latin America, Middle East & Africa (LAMEA ‐ Brazil, and rest of Latin America). North America continues to be the market leader throughout the analysis period of 2017‐2025. Asia-Pacific is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period on account of the increasing demand and a larger youth population base in the region. Australia had 3,351 health clubs with total number of memberships in the range of 3.4‐3.5 million in 2014. High prevalence of sports culture, increase in health consciousness, and rise in expenditure on fitness are the factors expected to propel the growth of the fitness equipment market in the country.

BSEB chairman Anand Kishor said the move would ensure greater participation of candidates in other competitive examinations as well as degree courses, which require Class XII certificates.

Kishor, however, clarified that the ITI passouts would have to write and clear the English and Hindi language papers to attain the Class XII certificate from the BSEB. He said the application form for examinations would be uploaded to the Board's website in January 2019. Examinations are likely to be held in May or June.

The ITIs impart skills to the students in various fields such as fabrication, electronics and automobile industries. The BSEB has named the Class XII certificate for an ITI candidate as 'Industrial Training Higher Secondary Language Examination' (ITHSLE)'. The application form for the examination will cost Rs1,170 for general and Rs945 for SC/ST and other categories.

Kishor said candidates can apply for the certificate only on completing their first year in an ITI or completed their diploma course long back from a private or government ITIs affiliated to the National Council of Vocational Training and State Council of Vocational Training.

""On ITHSLE certificate, an ITI candidate will be able to pursue their degree courses and sit in any competitive examination which requires Class XII certificates,"" he said.

Regarding the curriculum, Kishor said it would remain the same as in Class XII.

Meanwhile, the board sanctioned Rs1.7 crore for the restructuring of Intermediate Council and BSEB HQ offices. All the works related to Class X and XII board examinations would be held at its HQ. It will have other offices like of accounts, IT and a strongroom for bar-coded answer sheets. The Inter Council building would have offices of colleges and schools, vigilance, grievance cell, legal cell, online felicitation system for students and monitoring cell for regional centres.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on US college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the US Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said _ barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees _ or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there _ are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Detention camps in Xinjiang

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the US, and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear _ jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more _ from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to US customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The US and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the US.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the US, Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the US that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""US consumers should not be buying and US businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

Stringent state security under President Xi Jinping

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the US

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Themed ""A Legacy of Service for 95 Years,"" this black-tie event payed tribute to the volunteer service these extraordinary women have provided to the Washington community since 1923.

Narrated by Tony Award-winning and Emmy-nominated actress and stage director, Phylicia Rashad, the ""A Legacy of Service for 95 Years"" presentation gave a vivid portrayal of the chapter's history of philanthropy, social activism, and civic engagement since its chartering.

Guests enjoyed a congratulatory toast from Alpha Kappa Alpha's 29th International President, Dorothy Buckhanan Wilson, greetings and proclamations from the Mayor of the District of Columbia, Muriel Bowser, and Ward 4 Councilmember Brandon T. Todd. In addition, they were joined by newly-elected U.S. Congresswoman Lauren Underwood (IL-14), who is a Xi Omega member, former Alpha Kappa Alpha North Atlantic Regional Directors, and the Cluster I presidents of the District of Columbia and Maryland chapters of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.

The gala's corporate sponsors included Destination DC™, Renaissance Washington DC Downtown Hotel, Verizon, and Laurel Radiology Services.

Ninety-five years ago, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., Xi Omega Chapter was chartered by 20 women, committed to improving the quality of life for the less fortunate throughout the Washington area, with a special emphasis on women and children. From 20 women to now more than 500 members, the women of Xi Omega, under the leadership of chapter president April Gaines-Jernigan, have used their economic and political strength for positive change while maintaining their commitment to service through hands-on volunteerism. The chapter works collaboratively with local government and other community organizations to maximize outreach and service to its constituents.

In celebration of its 95th anniversary, Xi Omega commissioned an oil painting from artist Jonathon Romain, that captured the chapter's history from its first AKA house to its service projects in the DC community and abroad.

Annually, Xi Omega gives scholarships to 15 to 20 DC Public School students to encourage life-long learning and has awarded over $500,000 in scholarships. For more than 36 years, every Monday, through the Monday Activities program, Xi Omega Center opens its doors to seniors, currently ranging in age from 55 to 98 years old, for arts and crafts, sign language class, aerobics, bridge, memory stimulating games and free lunch. From help for the poor, the sick, and underserved to social action to advance human and civil rights, the women of Xi Omega Chapter have given the Washington community 95 years of service.

Xi Omega Chapter is the oldest and largest graduate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. in Washington, DC. Established in 1923, the chapter has a membership of more than 500 professional women, who serve the District and surrounding communities. Xi Omega's signature service programs focus on HBCU 4 Life: A Call to Action, Women's Healthcare and Wellness, Building Your Economic Legacy, The Arts!, and Global Impact.

New studies have shown their effectiveness even vis a vis surgeries.

While we have been swept off our feet by the incredible developments in medical care, from genetic engineering of embryos to robotic cardiac surgery, perhaps the most astonishing advance of all has gone relatively unnoticed. This medical miracle has been recognised since antiquity and practised by all healing traditions. However, until recently, it was not considered to be an authentic medical intervention because it lacked a robust biological explanation and was considered to be no more than plain luck. Perhaps the real reason this marvel has gone unnoticed, particularly by allopathy, is because the active ingredient needs no prescription, is not shrouded by scientific jargon, is not patented by corporations, and does not enrich its practitioners.

Hope is that miracle. It resides in each of us, costs absolutely nothing, and all it needs to be pumped into action is a state of mind, which can be invoked by simply believing in the possibility of recovery. Yet, physicians like myself who were groomed in a rigorous scientific temper, have been taught that this pervasive human quality is the biggest threat to the discovery of medical interventions. The allopathic tradition of medicine has historically distinguished itself from all other forms of healing by rejecting hope as a scientifically-sound basis for recovery, for there was no discernible way it could restore biological systems disrupted by disease. This is precisely the reason that allopathy dismissed other traditions of medicine, from homeopathy to spiritual healing. According to our dogma, you were fooled by ritual into be feeling better but, in actual fact, you were just lucky.

This is why all new allopathic medications must be compared with a dummy pill, the placebo, to test whether there is a ""real"" benefit, one which outwitted the magical effects of hope. This is especially true for medications targeting complaints which are subjective, such as aches and pains, allergies and all mental health conditions. In all these conditions, clinical trials have repeatedly shown that the effects of hope on relieving distress were large, often larger than the specific benefits of any medication. But in the past year, we have now been confronted by the finding that such placebo effects are even observed in the case of surgical procedures, previously thought to be immune to the confounding effects of hope. In part due to the absence of any plausible ""placebo"" control for surgical procedures, and the belief that because surgical procedures corrected pathological anatomic disruptions they did not need to be tested in the same way as medications, surgical procedures such as coronary angioplasty to relieve the chest pain, or shoulder surgeries to relieve arthritic pain, have grown at an industrial scale.

Recently, some courageous researchers, practitioners, patients, ethics committees and funders have begun to interrogate the placebo response to common surgical procedures. Two such experiments, funded by the United Kingdom's national research agency whose goal is to determine whether specific medical procedures are worthy of public financing, published their findings in the Lancet this past year. Both have upended the widely-cherished beliefs about the effectiveness of two of the most commonly used, and lucrative, surgeries in modern times, neither of which had been compared with a placebo before.

Advertising

One experiment evaluated coronary angioplasty in patients with angina who had severe blockage of a single coronary artery; this procedure is believed to relieve chest pain by opening up a passage to allow blood to flow through the blocked artery. The second experiment evaluated decompression of the shoulder joint. The anatomic rationale for this surgery is that the shoulder pain is caused by physical contact during arm movement between the shoulder joint tendons and a bony spur and the surgery is intended to reduce the contact between these parts of the joint.

A key aspect of the placebo condition is that the patient must believe they have had the procedure to trigger the hope response. Incredibly, this means that the placebo group of patients had to go through all the procedures which the group receiving the actual intervention did, from being admitted to hospital, having all the diagnostic tests, being prepared for surgery, being anaesthetised and getting a skin incision; everything except the actual procedure itself. Apart from the astounding fact that the researchers received ethical approval for these experiments, and that patients (more than 200 hundred for the angioplasty study) consented to participate knowing they might receive a sham procedure, what was even more astonishing was the finding that both groups showed exactly the same degree of improvement in their symptoms following the procedures.

The discovery of the placebo response to these common surgical procedures adds to the mountain of evidence that hope is a major driver of recovery in response to many medical procedures. Hope is not, as it were, all in our minds. Thanks to novel neuro-imaging technologies, we now know that hope is a powerful stimulant of a brain pathways triggering a series of complex, if yet to be fully deciphered, biological processes which not only relieve distress but even lead to physiological remission in a diseased organ. Amazingly, it seems that all the accessories of surgery, the rituals of being scrubbed, prodded by a gowned figure, anaesthetised, waking up experiencing the pain of an incision and so on, are no different from those which might explain the miracles of recovery from homeopathy and faith-healing, also replete with rituals and experiences out of the ordinary.

Many allopathic practitioners will reject these findings, claiming they do not conform with their clinical experience. They will be joined by hospitals and device manufacturers who will fortify themselves with jargon and promote expensive treatments for conditions which may just as often be treated by something we all possess and costs nothing. Of course, some medical procedures are needed for some afflictions, but hope is needed for all. The implications of this medical miracle for my fellow physicians is patently obvious: Before we whip out your prescription pads or polish our scalpels, we should be spending more time listening to our patients, building a therapeutic relationship and giving hope. This may well be a better investment than anything else we do, particularly if we count our returns in terms of patient satisfaction and recovery.

Jammu and Kashmir High Court on Wednesday sought response from State government and National Sports Federations with respect to augmentation of sports infrastructure across the state.

Amicus Curie Advocate Syed Faisal Qadri informed the Court that two National sports academies, Pullele Badminton Academy, Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy have submitted their response with respect to provide their assistance in developing facilities and training in J&K in their respective sports disciplines.

After hearing Amicus, the division bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Sanjeev Kumar directed Amicus Curie to reach out to other National sports academies and get suggestions from them.

Court also directed Advocate Ateeb Kanth, representing Badminton and Basketball Federations, to file response with regard to encourage these two sports disciplines in the state.

JKSSC was also directed to file response and furnish a list of the available equipments besides training and sports facilities for various sports disciplines in the state within two days.

Previously, Court had directed Amicus Curiae, Syed Faisal Qadri to reach out to National sports academies of three sports disciplines comprising Pullele Badminton Academy, Prakash Padukone Badminton Academy, Mary Com Boxing Academy and Tejpal Dhaliwal Basketball Academy to seek suggestions and ways to propagate these games in J&K.

The authorities of these academies were also requested by the court to provide their assistance in developing facilities and training in J&K in their respective sports disciplines.

Earlier, the court had taken suo-moto cognizance on the basis of media reports highlighting the lack of necessary infrastructure, facilities and opportunities for the children to participate in sports and compete at National School Games.

Court remarked that sports activities were essential, holistic and a complete way of education. The judges said that sports help in building personal appearances and team work attitude in children. Sports are healthy for both mind and body, the judges said.

It also remarked that the State government was responsible for providing sports facilities to children. ""Adequate budget for sports has to be ensured by government to provide different sporting platforms to our growing youth,"" Court said.

Court further said that the Government of India and the National Sports Federations/ Associations can help J&K state in having all sports facilities in place.

While observing the court said that the state needs facilities for badminton, baseball, Kabbadi, Ludo, Billiards, Carom, Chess, Judo, Boxing, Cricket, Football and many other sports. Court remarked that J&K children should be given the opportunity to play at national and international events.

Meanwhile for small children, Court had directed recreational and amusement parks be established. It was also directed that changing rooms be also created."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

A building with the words ""Neighborhood Center"" at the top is seen behind barbed wire fences in the Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center in western China's Xinjiang region.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates, and the U.S. government said Tuesday it was reviewing the reports of forced labor at the factory.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Surveillance of Ethnic Minorities in Xinjiang

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius , which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

Detention Camps in Xi Jinping's China

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

EnviroBuild, a UK-based sustainable building materials company, announced on Tuesday, 18 December, that it would be using Dermophis donaldtrumpi as the name for the amphibian with no legs and poor eyesight.

The company says the name still will need to undergo peer review, but that other animals have been named after presidents in the past.

The name was chosen by Aidan Bell, the boss of the firm which paid thousands at an auction for the right, The Guardian reported.

Trump in June last year withdrew the US from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits countries to keeping a limit on rising global temperatures.

'It's the Perfect Name'

The small creature is blind and has an ability to bury its head in the ground. These features, Bell said, match the US leader's opinion on climate change.

The company said Trump's was ""the perfect name"" for the limbless animal.

The Panamanian underground amphibians are particularly vulnerable to global warming.

Dermophis donaldtrumpi, 10 centimetres in length and belonging to group of snake-like animals called caecilians, was recently found in Panama by a group of scientists.

Its naming rights were auctioned off in a fundraiser for Rainforest Trust, a non-profit rainforest conservation organisation, the report said.

The winning bid of 34,478 US dollars was made by Aidan Bell, the head of a UK-based sustainable building materials company called EnviroBuild.

""It is the perfect name. Caecilian is taken from the Latin caecus, meaning 'blind', perfectly mirroring the strategic vision President Trump has consistently shown towards climate change.""Aidan Bell

Bell said Trump's worldview resembled a caecilian's, whose eyes can only detect light and dark.

""Capable of seeing the world only in black and white. Donald Trump has claimed that climate change is a hoax by the Chinese,"" he added.

The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is primarily human-induced.

But Trump, whose administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda, has accused those scientists of having a ""political agenda"" and cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the Earth's rising temperatures.

""I don't know that it's man-made,"" he said in an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes in October. ""I'm not denying climate change but [temperatures] could very well go back,"" he added, without offering evidence.

He justified this decision by asserting that he had been elected to serve the citizens of Pittsburgh and not Paris and the deal disadvantaged US businesses and workers.

Caecilians lost their limbs at least 60 million years ago to better burrow in the earth, and live almost entirely underground.

""Burrowing its head underground helps Donald Trump when avoiding scientific consensus on anthropomorphic climate change and [he has] also appointed several energy lobbyists to the Environment Agency, where their job is to regulate the energy industry,"" Bell said."

Panty Liners Market- What is the Creating the Hype?

Growing preference for personal hygiene and self-grooming is persuading women to adopt products meant for personal hygiene. The growing demand for panty liners is tied up to several influential aspects such as easy accessibility, affordability, and trend of overcoming the traditional stereotypes or cultural barriers. Rage of social programs, awareness campaigns, commercial ads, and governmental initiatives are further complementing the penetration of panty liners, primarily in the emerging realms.

Furthermore, continuous influence is being exerted by governments on manufacturers of panty liners to come up with new product innovations and formats. The objective is to change perceptions of the society, usher in striking ideas, and encourage women to take immense care of their health. All the aforementioned factors are believed to provide a substantial thrust to dynamics of the panty liners market. Moreover, women are being encouraged to use feminine care products, such as panty liners, which will help them attain confidence and self-esteem. This is also foreseen as a predominant factor pushing the growth of panty liners market.

Panty Liners Market- Trends Transforming the Market Landscape

In the feminine hygiene market, comfort is of paramount importance and has become uncompromising. There exists a school of thought that panty liners need to be positioned sensitively and panty liners with wings are well-furnishing this need. Working women are on the lookout for thinner, smarter, drier, and more absorbent panty liners so that they don't have to face the inconvenience of changing them frequently at the workplace. Women have started using panty liners during light menstruation instead of using clothes or sanitary napkins, which is positively upping the demand.

Moreover, companies are also experimenting with the packaging formats to seek customer attention. The format of packaging plays a pivotal role in building the brand personality and subsequent perceptions amid the consumer landscape. Furthermore, panty liners designed out of natural materials and natural chemicals are gaining immense traction and exerting a positive impact on the market. Women hailing from developed countries, such as the U.S., are preferring for natural products in the light of several health benefits offered. There are notions prevailing that cervical cancer might be caused due to harmful chemicals & bleaching agents. So, manufacturers can bank on this notion to reap profits with organic and natural polymers.

Rajan Singh graduated from IIT-Kanpur, went on to serve in the police force and today runs edtech startup ConceptOwl.

If that is not an impressive list of achievements, we are not sure what is! Rajan was with the Indian Police Service for eight years and served as the Police Commissioner of Thiruvananthapuram for three of those, managing a force of 3,500 policemen. However, the urge to tread a different path soon led him to the corporate world. ""After having served half my tenure as a Commissioner Police, I got bored and decided to leave,"" says Rajan.

He went on to study at Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania and joined McKinsey & Company as a consultant. From there, he moved on to New Silk Route Private Equity where he focused on growth stage companies in Asia.

But Rajan always wanted to be an entrepreneur and start his own company.

""As an investor, I used to meet a lot of entrepreneurs. I saw that the only thing which made them different from us professionals was the ability to take risks. I did not want to regret not taking a chance in life. I quit my job and took the risk of becoming an entrepreneur,"" he says.

In 2012, he began his entrepreneurial journey with edtech company CourseBrew, but his ""passion was science and at CourseBrew, the learning was not science-specific,"" so he quit. In 2o16, he started ConceptOwl - a teacherless online-in-classroom educational platform to help students prepare for entrance exams.

ConceptOwl was started in Thiruvananthapuram and Rajan sought to provide affordable science coaching programmes across Tier II and Tier III cities.

""Students in these areas lack quality coaching and lakhs are forced to migrate to cities like Kota or Hyderabad,"" he says.

The platform, with a website and application, tied-up with Kota's Bansal Classes for tests and practice.

In 2017, Rajan, along with Bansal Classes, started classroom teaching for students of standard 9 to 12, offering Maths and Science coaching in an independent center.

tied up with schools and began classroom programmes. However, he soon had to start teaching Physics himself as the company was unable to retain good teachers, as they shifted to Tier I cities for better opportunities.

""While teaching, I realised that students' attention levels and engagement would shoot up whenever we gave them problems to solve,"" he says. Thus, in early 2018, team ConceptOwl started creating videos, aiming to recreate a live-class experience along with problem-solving activities.

Currently, ConceptOwl's coaching programmes are available at Rs 20,000 per year, for classes 7 to 10 and at Rs 30,000 for classes 11th and 12th, and are a combination of online and offline education.

Rajan says, ""'Concept' links back to our goal of bringing back focus to concepts instead of just cramming. Also, my daughter is a Harry Potter fan and I found Hedwig cute. Not only that but owls generally symbolise wisdom.""

In a ConceptOwl class, the teacher is replaced by a facilitator or Classroom Manager, who manages the teaching as per the script. ""A pre-recorded video allows effective structuring and scripting for the teaching process,"" says the founder.

A facilitator is a Science graduate who can engage with students, enforce discipline and manage the class. They show videos on a smart television screen or projector, ask questions and collect doubts from the students. In case of a doubt, if the facilitator is unable to solve the problem, he forwards it to a team of instructors, also called the 'real-time remote instructors.'

These instructors either send responses or shoot a video to be shared with the class. With six instructors as part of the team, ConceptOwl also has five instructors working on an hourly-basis.

""Instructors are usually experts in the domain and besides having their concepts clear, they are able to solve problems and elucidate the concepts to the students,"" says Rajan.

Homework, assignments and tests are given online, and all students enrolled in the startup's courses are required to have an Android device with internet support.

While it currently operates as an after-school programme, ConceptOwl will soon start a franchise programme where a franchisee does not have to spend anything on instructor salary as the company will provide scripted videos themselves.

They cover school syllabus as well prepare students for entrances. ""We teach Physics, Chemistry, Biology and Math,"" says Rajan.

What started as a team of five, consists of 25 people now.

""We are all from small towns and can attest to the problem (of the lack of good coaching centres) first-hand,"" says Rajan.

Nisha Salim, who manages Product and Operations, was the first hire for ConceptOwl. Before that, she was running her own copywriting business. One of the other core members, Jayadevan, has a teaching experience of 30 years.

According to the KPMG 'Online Education in India: 2021' study, the Indian online education market was worth $247 million and had around 1.6 million users in 2016, and is set to grow to $1.96 billion and 9.6 users by 2021.

While there are several prominent players in the edtech market like Byju's, Khan Academy, Notesgen, AlmaMapper and Stuvia, ConceptOwl's model - combining aspects of traditional offline and modern online learning - sets it apart.

""While there are plenty of online players, parents still prefer sending their children to physical coaching centers,"" says Rajan.

The company claims to have a revenue of Rs 2 crore and says it is almost breaking even. He adds that ConceptOwl is poised to grow 10 fold in the next year.

It has raised Rs 3.5 crore since its inception, and its principal investor is SunTec Business Solution.

Rajan has tested the business model in two locations and is now rolling out the programme in 15 schools with 700 students in the districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Alleppey. His goal is to reach 100 locations in the next 12 months, primarily in South Indian states of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and some parts of Andhra Pradesh as well as North East India.

The ConceptOwl team is also building programmes in Hindi and other regional languages to reach out to millions of Tier II and Tier III students and provide them the same quality learning as found in metro cities."

Precautions

Children of school-going age require less energy from fat, so it's really important to keep an eye on the portion sizes as cheese is high in fat.

Salt recommendation for children 7-10 years is 5gm (1tsp) and over 11 years is 6gm, and cheese may often contain more salt than you think.

Too much cheese consumption may cause constipation, so give in moderation along with veggies.

Addressing media persons here today, the Union Minister for Tribal Affairs Shri Jual Oram said that consequent upon Budget announcement for 2018-19, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs, in its meeting held on 17th December, 2018, has decided that by the year 2022, every block with more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons, will have an Eklavya Model Residential School. Eklavya schools will be on par with Navodaya Vidyalayas and will have special facilities for preserving local art and culture besides providing training in sports and skill development. Across the country, as per census 2011 figures, there are 564 sub-districts i.e. blocks/taluka/tehsil having more than 50% ST population and at least 20,000 tribal persons. Out of these sub-districts, at present 102 sub-districts have EMRSs.

He informed the media persons that it is proposed to establish new EMRSs in the remaining 462 sub-districts by the year 2022 as per the phasing plan as given below:

The Minister said that the proposed scale up of the initiative through enhanced recurring and non-recurring cost is a path breaking initiative. This will immensely help in reducing gaps in literacy between ST population vis-à-vis overall population. The focus is on academic excellence through this upscaled initiative and will lead to holistic development of tribal children.

Ministry of Tribal Affairs (M/oTA) was set up in 1999, with the objective of providing more focused approach on the integrated socio-economic development of the Scheduled Tribes (STs), the most underprivileged of the Indian Society, in a coordinated and planned manner. M/oTA is the nodal Ministry for overall policy, planning and coordination of programmes for development of STs. One of the important educational intervention by Ministry of Tribal Affairs is establishing Eklavya Model Residential Schools with the objective of enhancing access to quality education and to maximize retention of ST students within various stages of school education and promoting higher learning among them. EMRS is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to ST children. Apart from school building including hostels and staff quarters, provision for a playground, students' computer lab, teacher resource room etc. are also included in the EMRSs. A total of 284 EMRSs have been sanctioned as on date, out of which 219 have been reported functional, with about 65,231 students enrolled therein. The existing non-recurring cost is Rs.12.00 Crores (16.00 Crores for North East, hilly, deserts and islands). The recurring cost is Rs.61500/- from 2018-19.

The important features of the decision are:-

1. Setting up of Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) in 462 blocks having more than 50% ST population with minimum 20,000 ST population by the year 2022 including 12 Eklavya Model Day Boarding School (EMDBS). It may be also being mentioned that EMDBS will be established wherever density of ST population is higher in identified Sub-Districts/Blocks (90% or more). This will be a boost for providing additional scope for ST Students seeking to avail school education without residential facility.

2. Financial provisions for 145 EMRSs and 5 EMDBSs during 2018-19 and 2019-20.

3. Setting up of an Autonomous Society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the EMRSs. (The Society to function through an Executive Committee (EC) under the Chairmanship of Secretary, Tribal Affairs. The EC shall be responsible for the management of all affairs including allocation of funds for setting up and functioning of EMRSs. The composition of the Steering Committee will be decided with the approval of the Minister, Tribal Affairs.

4. Enhancing the construction cost of EMRS (with 480 students capacity) to Rs. 20.00 Crore.

5. Cost of construction of EMRSs for North East, hilly areas, difficult areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism at 20% more than the normal cost.

6. Enhancing the recurring cost from the existing Rs. 61,500/- to Rs. 1,09,000/- per student per year from 2019-20 and recurring cost for EMDBS to Rs. 85,000/- per student per year from 2019-20.

7. Upgradation of already sanctioned EMRSs on need basis with unit cost subject to a maximum of Rs. 5 crores per school.

8. Setting up Centre of Excellence for sports at select locations with all related infrastructure (buildings, equipment's etc.).

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before.

The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang.

""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained.

The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Buildings are seen around the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux.

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign.

They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility.""

Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up.

But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years.

He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments.

The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there.

But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration on Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping.

Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp.

Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks.

Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls.

The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training.""

The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp.

He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said.

""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

It has been a turning point in my life and for women in the village at Vakavli in Chiplun district,"" said 62-year-old Lalita Babaji Sakpal, who was the sarpanch for five years. A social worker for a long time who worked in the formation of self-help groups (SHGs), Sakpal says she got the vote of the women as they knew of her and the work she had done over the years.

With the government making mandatory 50 percent reservation for women in Panchayati Raj Institutions on 27 August, 2009, women in villages have been able to address core issues that affect them and impact their families. But it took a while before these women could stand up for their rights.

Firstpost visited a few villages in Ratnagiri district to find out if the numbers of women and their participation in the village panchayat have increased and brought about more relief. Initially, though women found themselves in the limelight with the government rule, most of them were tongue-tied and remained at the helm of the panchayat for namesake only. ""Sign here. Please sit here for the meeting,"" these were the only instructions given by the menfolk and out of fear and respect, the women sarpanchs followed them, said Shyamal Kadam of NGO Parivartan in Chiplun.

Parivartan works closely with women on sustainable development which Kadam says remains incomplete without the active participation of women. It has worked with women on various issues ranging from mobilising women under SHGs, making them understand the importance of coming together, savings as well as building their capacities to sustain the collectives and working with the EWRs (Elected Women Representatives) in villages.

Women in the villages come together to celebrate festivals but shy away from any serious discussions that require their involvement. Fifty-six-year-old Anjali Ashok Baikar, who set up a mahila gram sabha was able to get a full quorum by participating in the women-only functions and satsang celebrations and talking to women. Women's participation has resulted in addressing issues they continue to face and are intimately aware of working in the kitchen.

""There was water spillage and wastage in Mandangad tehsil block of Ratnagiri district. I found that we could seek for money under the Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation's National Rural Drinking Water Security Pilot Project (NRDWSPP) for improved rural water supply,"" says Baikar. She was able to get Rs 45 lakh from the project and Palghar village in Mandangad was able to get water taps in all public water filling areas.

Agriculture is the only means of livelihoods for the villagers. The market of Mandangad is also not developed, it is one of most underdeveloped block level markets in Ratnagiri district. In such situation, business has very limited scope when the capital is constrained.

Baikar formed a SHG here in 2003 with saving-credit transactions. The SHG decided to carry out an income generation activity studying the market situation. She found that papad as a product had much scope but needed to standout on aspects of quality, test and price. Recognising the rural consumers pulse for cost-effective, frequently required and tasty products, the SHG is gaining foothold in the market. ""Last year (April & May), with a total sale of 26,500, we earned a net profit of Rs 19,000 with mere investment of Rs 7,500. The input capital were made available through the government's UMED Maharashtra State Rural Livelihoods Mission program.

Baikar now has been able to make programs for women, handicapped and set up SHG groups to enable women to have a sustainable livelihood making papads, pickles, handicrafts, tailoring and also sets up exhibitions. Apart from this, she leads the social well-being activities such as cleanliness drives, health awareness programs, street-plays for awareness generation on social is-sues, plantation drives etc

Baikar now has been able to make programmes for women, handicapped and set up SHG groups to enable women to have a sustainable livelihood making papads, pickles, handicrafts, tailoring and also sets up exhibitions.

Shraddha D, a housewife, shares her experience of finding a 'demand' for her products and be able to have money of her own. ""I never thought there would be buyers for the pickles I make. My family appreciated what I did but it never occurred to me to sell it. If it was not for Bagkar, I would have remained in my home and neighbourhood,"" she said. Now, the 31-year-old talks of how her money has come in the aid of her children's education.

Some women like Parvati Shankar Bhuved who have not been to school found their lives changed with marriage. Married into a family of people who were not educated themselves, Bhuved was pushed into thinking 'of doing something for the village' by her father-in-law. She got an opportunity to become the sarpanch and talks proudly of the various certificates and awards she won.

What the women have been able to do is break the shackles of the tradition-bound village life and eke out a livelihood within the comforts of their house and in the process emerge confident and self-reliant. There has been an overall improvement in women sarpanchs -- 43 percent of total gram panchayats (GPs) across the country, exhibiting active leadership of women in local government, according to the Economic Survey for 2017-18 tabled in Parliament.

However, there is much more that needs to be done as women are facing an array of issues and obstacles right from discrimination, violence, resource deprivation, confinement from social participation, economic backwardness to namesake participation in Panchayati Raj system which continues, says Kadam.

An apex level federation was debated quite extensively in the last few years in village and block level women organisations and now there is a strong organised network of rural women leaders at the village, block and district level. A district-level women federation that has representation from across the villages in four blocks spearhead development actions.

The strategic structure with apex and support organisations at grassroots has helped women leaders to effectively put forward their issues at the grassroots level, following them with the government (or any other relevant entity), finding way outs and execution of decisions. Young women have been finding their voices thanks to women having held and holding key positions in the panchayat. The menfolk were earlier surprised by their women venturing out of the homes. But as their women work on a whole range of issues from animal husbandry (virus in cattle that led to many animals death), to getting loans from SHGs; water issues, to training women in entrepreneurship and working towards abolition of social issues like alcoholism and abuse by menfolk, Babaji Sitaram Sakpal says that though he is a teacher, women like his wife and other rural women have been able to what most men haven't given a thought to.

Panty Liners Market- What is the Creating the Hype?

Growing preference for personal hygiene and self-grooming is persuading women to adopt products meant for personal hygiene. The growing demand for panty liners is tied up to several influential aspects such as easy accessibility, affordability, and trend of overcoming the traditional stereotypes or cultural barriers. Rage of social programs, awareness campaigns, commercial ads, and governmental initiatives are further complementing the penetration of panty liners, primarily in the emerging realms.

Furthermore, continuous influence is being exerted by governments on manufacturers of panty liners to come up with new product innovations and formats. The objective is to change perceptions of the society, usher in striking ideas, and encourage women to take immense care of their health. All the aforementioned factors are believed to provide a substantial thrust to dynamics of the panty liners market. Moreover, women are being encouraged to use feminine care products, such as panty liners, which will help them attain confidence and self-esteem. This is also foreseen as a predominant factor pushing the growth of panty liners market.

Panty Liners Market- Trends Transforming the Market Landscape

In the feminine hygiene market, comfort is of paramount importance and has become uncompromising. There exists a school of thought that panty liners need to be positioned sensitively and panty liners with wings are well-furnishing this need. Working women are on the lookout for thinner, smarter, drier, and more absorbent panty liners so that they don't have to face the inconvenience of changing them frequently at the workplace. Women have started using panty liners during light menstruation instead of using clothes or sanitary napkins, which is positively upping the demand.

Moreover, companies are also experimenting with the packaging formats to seek customer attention. The format of packaging plays a pivotal role in building the brand personality and subsequent perceptions amid the consumer landscape. Furthermore, panty liners designed out of natural materials and natural chemicals are gaining immense traction and exerting a positive impact on the market. Women hailing from developed countries, such as the U.S., are preferring for natural products in the light of several health benefits offered. There are notions prevailing that cervical cancer might be caused due to harmful chemicals & bleaching agents. So, manufacturers can bank on this notion to reap profits with organic and natural polymers.

A photograph of Marx overlooks stacks of plastic chairs, crammed bookshelves and an old desktop computer in an office on the ground floor of a building in central Mumbai. On the evening of January 12, a group of electricity workers affiliated with the Mumbai Electric Employees Union met here. They worked for Reliance Energy, which supplied electricity to homes in the city's suburbs. Despite working for the company for around two decades, laying cables and excavating new lines, they were not permanent employees - they were hired by contractors, who supplied labour to the company.

The previous few weeks had been tumultuous. The company was in the middle of a major transition: its ownership was changing hands, with the Adani Group in the process of taking over.

During this period, a worker died on December 19. He was returning home from work when he fainted and hit his head, resulting in a brain haemorrhage. All the workers in the area - permanent and contract - went on a one-day strike to force the company to pay full-duty compensation to his family.

It seemed like a victory - except, on January 1, the contract workers found they had been marked absent for the day of the strike, while the permanent workers had not. When the union raised this, four workers were suspended on January 9.

Three days later, the union met in their Dadar office to discuss this suspension. Hours later, close to midnight, four of its members found men in plain clothes at their doorstep.

""At around 11.45 pm, around 15 to 20 people came to our door,"" said Rajitha, wife of Satyanarayana Karrela, 40, one of the union members. ""We did not know who they were as they were in civil dress. When we asked they just told us they had work with us.""

The men made the couple sit with their backs to each other and asked them to stay silent as they went about ransacking the house. At the end of the search, they said that they had to take Karrela with them. Panicking that he was about to be kidnapped, Rajitha seized her husband's arm and refused to let go. At this point, she said, the men announced they were the police. They said Karrela would be released in the morning. When she still refused to let go, they wrote an address and phone number on a piece of paper and told her to come there the next morning.

Similar stories played out at the houses of other union members that night - Babushankar Vanguri, 30, Shankar Gunde, 40, and Ravi Marampelli, 40. Large groups of police in plain clothes appeared close to midnight, searched their houses and took them away.

This was no ordinary police detail - it was the Anti-Terrorism Squad of the Maharashtra Police. As the families of the union members found out later, the arrests had been made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which punishes those proved guilty of working with banned organisations. In this case, the ATS claims the workers had been funding the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist), which has been fighting a protracted guerilla war in central and eastern India for decades with the aim of overthrowing the government.

How exactly had low-paid workers in Mumbai, who barely earned enough to support their families in India's most expensive city, saved money to send to an underground organisation?

The police claims they did so by raising money from contractors.

At the heart of the police claims, as outlined in its 5,000-page chargesheet submitted in May, are two bank cheques of Rs 1.5 lakh each. Issued in May 2017, the cheques was signed by three office bearers of a contractors association that supplied labour to Reliance Energy. The police claim the workers encashed the cheques and passed on the money to a Maoist operative, who further transferred the money to underground Maoists in Telangana.

But other union members have a simpler explanation for the cheques: they say they were written in support of the union's annual May Day function.

""The workers organised May Day functions every year and get donations from the contractors association for this,"" said N Vasudevan of the New Trade Union Initiative that backs the contract workers' union.

On the same day that they arrested the four union members, the police also arrested Narsaiah Jumpala, one of the three signatories of the cheques and a member of the contractors association. Anjaiah Anthati, president of the association, said there was no coercion at the contractor association meeting at which they decided to sign the cheques. The association, he claimed, makes donations to all workers unions every few years and that too in ""white"" money, by cheque, not cash.

""We can conduct our business only if we have good relations with them,"" said Anthati. ""If we tell them, 'No, go, we won't give you anything', then at some point, the union people will cause trouble for us. That is why we tell them we will take care of them. For this, we have to give them chai paani (money).""

But the police has cited witness statements from at least unnamed 12 contractors in support of its claims. These feature as part of the chargesheet, among the 100-odd statements which have been cited after redacting witness names.

Strikingly, all 12 statements contain identical paragraphs about how the workers introduced a man named ""Mahesh"", who they claimed worked for ""the Party"". ""As I am a resident of Andhra Pradesh, I know that in our native place, Naxalites are recognised as being of the 'party,'"" reads every single statement as translated into Marathi, purportedly made independently in Hindi by each contractor. ""Since then, we became afraid of the topic of Mahesh and whenever Ravi Marampelli, Satyanarayana Karrela and Shankar Gunde asked us for money, we always gave them money out of fear.""

Said Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, ""If they have made identical statements to us, that is why we have recorded it that way.""

On January 12, along with four workers and the contractor, the police also arrested a man named Ajay Dasari, who they allege is the Maoist operative who workers introduced as ""Mahesh"". The seventh arrest, also made the same day, was of Ramesh Gondiala, 37, a pro-Telangana poet and activist who worked as a milk delivery man near Kalyan, on the outskirts of Mumbai. In February, another worker, Saidulu Singapanga, 36, was taken into custody, taking the total number of arrests in the case to eight.

This isn't the only Maoist case brought by the Maharashtra police against urban residents. Over June and August, Pune police arrested ten lawyers and activists, accusing them of working with the banned CPI (Maoist) and labelling them ""Urban Naxals"". These arrests too were made under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act. Often described as draconian with vague definitions, it allows the police to hold the accused in prison for long periods by prohibiting the courts to grant bail as long as the accusation made by the police appears ""prima facie true"".

""As far as Maharashtra is concerned, there are very few UAPA cases,"" said Nihalsingh Rathod, a Nagpur lawyer with the Indian Association of People's Lawyers. ""Most cases are invoked against Islamic terrorism. The rest are concentrated in Gadchiroli district [in eastern Maharashtra, where there is a Maoist presence].""

Of the few in western Maharashtra, one is the union workers' case. Another is the 2011 case against alleged Maoist Angela Sontakke and the Kabir Kala Manch, a cultural organisation based in Pune, members of which have since been released on bail. In 2015, the Anti-Terrorism Squad arrested Konnath Muralidharan, a Maoist leader from Kerala while he was being treated at a hospital near Pune.

Given the prominence of the ten activists arrested between June and August, and a legal challenge to their arrests in the Supreme Court, discussions on the misuse of this 1960 law were briefly revived, before receding again.

According to Indiaspend, as many as 2,700 cases were filed under UAPA in three years between 2014 and 2016. Of the 33 trials under the law completed in 2016, it reported, 67% ended in acquittals. Evidence in several of these cases tends to be vague.

""I think a lot of leeway is given to the prosecuting agency at the pre-charge stage because it's their word against what the accused have to say,"" said senior advocate Rebecca John, who has argued several cases under the act. ""I don't think enough judicial scrutiny takes place at this stage. And very few of these cases end in conviction. For the prosecution, the period of incarceration is itself the punishment.""

A common thread that connects all of the men arrested on January 12 is the place where they came from: Telangana. Or more specifically, the two districts of Nalgonda and Karimnagar. Also common is their caste background: the workers are all Dalits.

The Mumbai Electric Employees Union was established in 2005, after a worker died while on duty. As contract workers, they were entitled to a compensation of only Rs 25,000 but as union members claim, they successfully forced the company to increase it Rs 6.5 lakh. Since then, the union grew in strength, attracting a large membership of around 1,000 of the company's 4,000 contract workers, many of whom are Telugu-speaking migrants. The Shiv Sena-affiliated Mumbai Electric Workers' Union, which is the only union which is recognised by the company and the Labour Commissioner, claims to represent all contract workers, apart from the 3,500-odd permanent workers, many of whom are Marathi-speaking.

All the arrested workers were office-bearers of the Mumbai Electric Employees Union and played a crucial role in every negotiation with the company and contractors. They all lived in and around Ghatkopar in central Mumbai with their wives and young children and had each been with the electricity company for around at least 15-20 years.

Work conditions were severe at first, say members of the union who worked with their arrested counterparts. Each day, they would go to the company's electricity office and contractors would tell them how many of them would get work for that day. Often, workers would return home empty-handed. With the formation of their union, however, working conditions changed. One of their first struggles was to ensure that all contract workers would get work daily. The arrested workers were active in ensuring this.

In their spare time, they organised reading groups and kept their fellow workers updated with political pamphlets and books related to Marxist, Ambedkarite and pro-Telangana ideology, said Vasudevan. Despite their long stint in the metropolis, the union members had strong connections to their homelands and were active in supporting the movement for a new Telangana state. When Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh in 2014, the new Telangana Rashtra Samiti government promised three acres of land each to landless Dalit farmers. The workers, said Vasudevan, made several trips back home in the hope of getting land.

A Telangana-based researcher specialising in human rights and law, who asked not to be identified, confirmed that many migrants did indeed come back in droves in the first year of the new government, thinking they had to be physically present to avail of the scheme. However, the scheme has not materialised. The workers had grown disenchanted with the new government, said Vasudevan.

According to their co-workers, all the arrested shared an interest in Ambedkarite and Marxist ideas. At all their homes, the police found books, magazines and pamphlets related to this ideology. At Singapanga's home, the police found copies of Veekshanam, a magazine edited by N Venugopal, a Telugu poet, literary critic and journalist.

""We have even published their letters in Veekshanam,"" said Venugopal, who knew six of the eight accused. ""That way they are socially active. But the charge the police is making now is preposterous and unbelievable.""

The police chargesheet contains a screenshot of an email sent by one of the arrested workers, Vanguri, to another arrested worker, Singapanga, inviting him to an event at Ramabai Nagar to protest the arrest of Manda Krishna Madiga, a Telugu Dalit rights activist living in Telangana. Krishna, who was subsequently released, has spoken against the Maoist party for betraying the cause of workers.

But an official of the Anti-Terrorism Squad, who did not want to be identified, claimed the workers' union itself was as an overground organisation of the Maoists. Such organisations are part of the Golden Corridor Committee plan, he said, through which Maoists seek to infiltrate industrial areas in western India.

By all accounts, the workers, however, showed greater interest in Ambedkarite ideas. On December 31, they travelled to Pune in a group of 40 to take part in the anti-caste commemoration at Bhima Koregaon near Pune, where Dalit soldiers with the East India Company had trounced the casteist Peshwa-led army of the Maratha empire in 1818. ""I had gone there for the first time because it was the 200th anniversary of the battle,"" said Saidulu Gondrigalla, one of the suspended workers who was part of the group. ""We saw the [memorial] pillar in the morning, while the garlands were still being put up, then returned to Pune for the Elgaar Parishad,"" a conference being held to mark the anniversay.

While they returned to Mumbai on January 1, back in Bhima Koregaon, Dalits came under attack that day, sparking a strike and caste clashes, which spread across western Maharashtra. By the second week of January, police had conducted sweeping arrests of Dalits they believed to have participated in the violence.

When news of the workers' arrests first came, their colleagues thought this might be related to this action. However, given that the arrested workers were all union members, they also wondered whether this had anything to do with their last protest against the management in December.

The chargesheet is silent on both.

Spokespersons of both Reliance Infrastructure and Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited declined to comment on the case or the suspension of the employees.

""We are not pursuing any such past matters,"" said a spokesperson for Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited in response to a detailed questionnaire. ""It's a brand new company and a brand new way to do things. We took over on August 29 and this is a matter of last year December and January.""

A representative of Reliance Infrastructure, the holding company for Reliance Energy, also declined to comment. ""As discussed, as this business is now with Adani Electricity, you may write to Adani Electricity,"" a Reliance Infrastructure spokesperson wrote in reply to Scroll.in's questions.

Other than the workers, those arrested in the case include Jumpala, the contractor, Dasari, the alleged Maoist operative, and Gondiala, a poet and activist whose connection to the workers is tenuous.

As general secretary of the contractors association, Narsaiah Jumpala was one of the authorised signatories for cheques issued by the organisation. He had a reputation within the association for being sympathetic to the cause of workers, according to both his wife, other workers in the union, and even the head of the contractors' association.

When the worker who later died was admitted to a hospital in December, the contractor who was his employer called Jumpala for advice, according to his wife. Jumpala told the contractor to go to the hospital. ""[The contractor] said he was afraid to go there alone as the workers would be agitated,"" she told Scroll.in. ""He then asked my husband to accompany him in the morning, as my husband has good relations with workers of other contractors as well.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association told Scroll.in that Jumpala did indeed have good relations with the workers. ""Vo worker ke piche hi rehta tha,"" he said. ""Jumpala was always with the workers, particularly that union...He used to favour them.""

The donation to the union came out of Jumpala's initiative, but the decision was taken collectively by 12 committee members, said Anthati. ""This fellow [Jumpala] only arranged the meeting for the workers,"" Anthati said. ""He asked me three times and I did not give him a time. The fourth time he asked me, I said all right and the entire committee sat and decided to give them money.""

There is not much information available about Ajay Dasari, the man the police claims the money was diverted to. The police chargesheet says he lived in Kalyan and even lists an address. But the address, a squat building adjacent to a larger bungalow, is occupied by families of Bihari and Jharkhand migrant workers, living there on rent. The wife of one of the workers confirmed the Anti-Terrorism Squad had visited this address on a Saturday in January, asking for Dasari.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, said Dasari was her husband's friend. They had met about five years ago while working at a cola factory in Kalyan and Dasari used to visit their home once or twice a month.

""Even now none of us can believe that he could be a terrorist like they said,"" the wife said. ""He always kept his eyes down, he spoke softly, did not look at any women, and never fought with anybody.""

Dasari told them that he lived with relatives in Thane, but that his wife and children were in his village in Telangana. They did not know much else about him.

The Telangana-based researcher found the police claims about a Maoist operative meeting openly with workers suspect.

""It is highly unlikely that if this person was a Maoist, he would go around telling people he was one,"" he said. ""In general, Maoists use cities as safe zones, where they don't take up any activity.""

An Anti-Terrorism Squad official familiar with the case who asked not to be identified agreed that ""Maoists keep their open activities away from secret ones to prevent detection."" However, he claimed that if Dasari was ""allowed access to both sides"", it indicated that he was in fact a ""high level functionary"".

It is not clear how Ramesh Gondiala, a poet and milkman, came to be linked to this case. A pro-Telangana activist from Nalgonda district, his connection with the workers is tenuous - according to Gondrigalla and Vasudevan, he met them in November 2013 at a meeting to support the formation of the state.

Venugopal, who wrote the preface to a book of poetry that Gondiala published, said his poetry covered issues of gender, Dalit rights, labour and the Telangana state.

Gondiala worked to deliver milk to houses in his neighbourhood and also worked as a driver. His wife told Scroll.in that he also regularly helped construction workers to arrange compensation or treatment for them if they suffered injuries or died while on duty.

The ATS also questioned another writer and translator, Prabhakar Macha, in the case. A teacher who was quite popular in Telugu writing circles, Venugopal said Macha was a significant link between Marathi and Telugu literature. He had written a 200-page book on the contribution of Telugu migrants to the building of Mumbai city.

In the first week of January, Macha's wife died. On January 23, a week after he was questioned by the ATS, he killed himself.

In the First Information Report filed hours after the arrests, the ATS claims its operative received a confidential tip-off from an informer, who told them that members of the Maoist party were raising money, recruiting new members and spreading Maoist propaganda to destabilise the nation. The informer said the members were going to congregate at Kalyan station at around 4.30 pm. The FIR charges seven men - excluding Singapanga at this stage - under sections 20, 38 and 39 of the the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, which pertain to membership of and recruitment to banned organisations, but not to fundraising for them. The charges of fundraising appear only in the chargesheet.

In the chargesheet, the police claims to have CCTV footage from an apartment building in Tilak Nagar, which purportedly shows Dasari meeting the arrested workers between 12 pm to 3 pm.

The ATS claims in the FIR that it arrested Dasari at Kalyan station at 5.30 pm. Through his interrogation, within a matter of hours, it was able to get the residential addresses of seven accomplices. At midnight, in simultaneous raids, six men were arrested.

Saidulu Singapanga is not among the seven individuals named in this FIR. Like several other union members at the time, Singapanga too did not appear for work for some weeks after the other union members were arrested, fearing that it was the union itself being targeted. When he reported for work on February 5, he was arrested immediately.

But questions have been raised over the police claims.

Jumpala's wife pointed out only her husband was arrested, even though cheques from the contractors association require three signatures. The union's founding minutes, a copy of which is in the chargesheet, designates three individuals - the president, general secretary and treasurer - as elected officers for bank transactions.

""When I confronted [another contractor in the association] about this, he became very aggressive and started shouting at me,"" Jumpala's wife told Scroll.in. ""He said he had nothing to do with the cheques, and that my husband had signed a cheques in his personal capacity and handed them over for illegal activities.""

Anthati, president of the contractors' association, said that all three signatories had indeed signed two cheques, each amounting to Rs 1.5 lakh, but did not hand them over to the union representatives at the meeting because they did not have a receipt book with them.

""I told them we would give them the cheques only after they gave us the receipt,"" Anthati said. However, he added, a few days later, Jumpala took the cheques from the office assistant, saying that he was going to Chembur, would give them to the union people and bring back a receipt. This never happened. Instead, the cheques were made out to two individual members of the union and the receipt never made it to the association office, he claimed. Scroll.in could not independently confirm this.

It is not clear from the chargesheet how the money from the cheques was passed on to the Maoists, nor is it clear whether or how the accused recruited new members for the Maoist cause.

Most of all, what is mysterious are the 12 near-identical statements purportedly made by contractors to the police.

Anthati said that as he operated in Kandivali zone in another part of the city, he did not know what the others had said to the police and whether they knew that their statements in Hindi had been identically translated into Marathi. Contractors in the east zone deflected numerous attempts by Scroll.in over almost two months to speak with them.

Advocate Rebecca John said that identical statements were a common feature of the UAPA cases she was familiar with. ""It is common to have nebulous evidence, nothing very concrete,"" John said. ""The police looks into their personal lives, including their computers, so that even if you download an article, you can become a member by association. The police also gets surrendered Maoists to make statements in which there is a fair degree of police control. In a fair world none of these cases would see the light of day.""

However, Atul Chandra Kulkarni, additional director general of police in charge of the Anti-Terrorism Squad staunchly defended the investigation. ""UAPA cases are especially serious because I know that people don't get bail or they will get a longer prison term if convicted,"" he said. ""That is why I don't cook up evidence nor do I let my officers do so. But of course, I have the prerogative to take X [fact or person] and not Y in my case if it supports that. Facts will be chosen to marshal evidence.""

He pointed out that his team was simultaneously working on a case involving Hindutva extremists who had been arrested with large caches of weapons and bombs.

Ten months after the arrests, the families of the union members are struggling. Reduced to single-income households, one family left for their village in Telangana, unable to pay the rent for their room. The others are being supported by women who have taken up domestic work to make ends meet. There is uncertainty over whether they would be able to pay their children's school fees.

There are other consequences too. The families of the workers were reluctant to meet Scroll.in in their homes to avoid drawing more attention to themselves. They said the ATS officials still visit them regularly, making their neighbours wary of them. One of their landlords even asked them to leave, to avoid the police attention.

Since the arrests, the scrappy union, which took on the company to fight for provident funds, safety equipment, identity cards and even a kind of job security with assured daily work to all its members, has become somewhat dormant.

""Because of this atmosphere, the workers are scared that if they remain with our union, they too will be arrested,"" Vasudevan said.

There are other losses which the workers rue, including the hard-earned one of dignity.

""When we go to make demands of the contractor now, they tell us to go away or we will also be arrested,"" said Laxman Bomma, one of the workers suspended on January 9. ""They normally give us our new uniforms in January, but we have not got that this year. We now have to go to Vile Parle to collect our salaries, when earlier they would give it at the offices where we report for work.""

Said Gondrigalla, ""Earlier, they would treat us with some respect and dignity. That is no longer there."""

When the Indian startup ecosystem - then mostly limited to Bengaluru and Delhi-NCR - was witnessing a funding frenzy in 2015, Hyderabad was still recovering from the turmoil in the wake of Telangana's birth. Known for its IT legacy, over the years, macro-economic factors had hampered growth and 2015 was almost the year for a fresh start.

Three years on, the city has acquired a serious reputation as a growing startup hub. It's not just about the funding that Hyderabad-based startups have raised. The number of entrepreneurs choosing to start up in the city is growing, as are the number of partnerships among startups, academic institutions, corporates, and the government.

One strong indicator of growth is funding raised. According to YourStory Research, Indian startups raised $8.3 billion in funding in 2015. Startups from Hyderabad raised $43 million that year - just 0.52 percent of the total. Cut to 2018: Indian startups have raised $11.23 billion so far. Of this, Hyderabad-based startups accounted for $400.95 million - that's 3.5 percent of the total.

The sheer number of startups too shows strong growth. In 2015, the Nizam's city was home to around 1,500 startups. Today, that number has grown to 4,000, according to the Telangana State Innovation Cell (TSIC).

""Hyderabad has always had a strong entrepreneurial DNA. The IT legacy is testament to that. But in these three years, there has been growing awareness and push towards new-age technology startups. Each year, at the Centre of Innovation and Entrepreneurship (CIE), the kind of startups that come in are different. The entrepreneurs are maturing and growing,"" says Ramesh Loganathan, a professor at IIIT and a mentor and guide at CIE.

There is also a growing number of students looking to start up, he adds. According to the CIE, there are 18 student-driven startups at IIIT today, up from just eight in 2015. In all, CIE is currently incubating 78 startups versus 54 in 2015.

The push to increase startup activity in the city comes from government quarters as well - while different states have announced startup-friendly policies, for Telangana, the idea was more of a 'need to have' than 'nice to have'.

Jayesh Ranjan, IT Secretary, Telangana Government, says,

""Being one of the youngest and newest states in the country, our first agenda was to build an ecosystem of technology and innovation. Post bifurcation, Hyderabad needed to catch up, and that needed to be done fast. We felt the quickest way to do that was by encouraging startups. So, we began with a basic framework and policy, and ensured it was translated on ground.""

The state government's policy framework focused on physical infrastructure and programme management capabilities, which facilitated the setting up of T-Hub in a public-private-partnership involving active participation from three academic institutes - IIIT-H, Indian School of Business (ISB), and NALSAR.

In the first phase, 2016 saw T-Hub become operational. It is spread over 70,000 sq ft and currently houses over 200 startups. The policy document by the government states that in the second phase, the facility will be spread over 3 lakh sq ft and will house over 3,000 startups.

T-Hub offers a co-working space that gives startups a chance to forge partnerships with companies, investors, and mentors, among others. Gayam Motors, a electric vehicle (EV) startup, which was incubated out of CIE and T-Hub, was selected to be a part of the Summit Mercedes-Benz EQ Global Fellowship.

""One-third of Telangana is government land so it can be easily given to set up labs and central government institutes. What we need to push is an output and get in a stronger density of companies,"" says Phanindra Sama, Chief Innovation Officer, TSIC and Co-founder of redBus.

The CIE is now planning to set up an accelerator that will focus on health/medical technology startups.

""We realised there were growing number of healthtech and healthcare startups in the city. These needed special attention and focus; hence, we thought of developing an accelerator inside CIE itself. Many startups in the space could be a part of the incubator,"" says Ramesh.

In October this year, the government also announced the first phase of T-Works to focus on manufacturing and product startups. Sujai Karampuri, CEO, T-Works, says, ""The idea has been to create a platform and a framework where converting an idea into a product becomes easy for hobbyists, engineers, makers, engineers, entrepreneurs, etc.""

T-Works wants to lower the barriers-to-entry for prototypes and create an environment where failure to develop a product is not frowned upon.

Sujai says that as a nation we have embraced software-related solutions and businesses, but, the ""same is not the case when it comes to developing a product in the domain of mechanical, electromechanical and electronics"".

IT Secretary Ranjan says that with the legacy of IT and corporate tie-ups, stronger collaborations would be the way forward. ""There are currently 40 incubators in the city, but they need to collaborate to grow faster. Collaboration always helps and makes the city grow faster. It is like the fuel that pushes strategy into action. We have all the different aspects of the ecosystem.""

The five must-haves for a startup are idea, implementation, market, a team, and funds. To create a sustainable funding model for startups in the city, the government also set up the T-Fund last year. With an initial corpus of Rs 100 crore, it invited startups to apply so that it can fund them. The T-Fund is also planning to start a Rs 600-crore seed fund that will take contributions from private investors.

Government efforts are clearly in place, but what of the private sector and its faith in the Hyderabad startup ecosystem?

In 2018, in all, 32 startups raised $400.95 million. In 2015, this number was $43 million across 33 deals. The mix across stages also was healthy, with 2018 seeing 15 pre-Series A deals, two PE rounds, four Series A rounds, and one each in Series B, C and E. This is a big change from 2017, when no Hyderabad-based companies raised Series B, C, D or E rounds. And in 2015, while there were 22 Pre-series A rounds, there were few others in the growth stage.

Former cricketer Sachin Tendulkar's interest in startups by investing in city-based USPL and Smartron gave the city a big boost. Investors agree.

""Startups in Hyderabad are as good as startups in Bengaluru, Delhi, or Mumbai. We don't invest in startups on the basis of the city or the region they are based out of,"" says Vaibhav Agarwal, Partner, LightSpeed Ventures.

While there is increased interest in the ecosystem, there are few funds or investors with offices in Hyderabad. The one that stands out is Endiya Partners. The Hyderabad-based early-stage venture capital firm was started by Sateesh Andra, Dr Ramesh Byrapaneni, and Abhishek Srivastava. The two-year-old fund has approximately Rs 200 crore to invest, and focuses on SaaS, security, mobility, semiconductors, fintech, digital healthcare, and medical devices.

Of the eight companies in Endiya Partners' portfolio, two - Ekincare and Darwinbox - are based out of Hyderabad.

""We believe Hyderabad has a strong base of entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. There is a strong product and growth focus in startups here. Also, when it comes to investments, we are sure we will soon add more Hyderabad startups to our portfolio,"" says Sateesh.

A seed investor based in the city says, ""The founders are getting a little more mature, and the startups here are understanding the focus on product.""

What would put Hyderabad on the startup map in a bigger way, say mentors and founders, is having a big startup from the city. Anu Acharya, Founder of Mapmygenome, says startups from the city are more driven towards enterprise tech, software, and healthcare. The last is, in fact, one of the top sectors garnering investment. This year, healthcare has accounted for $130 million of the total funding raised by Hyderabad-based startups.

Also, ThinCI, which is registered in the US, but runs its operations from the city, raised Series C of $65 million this year, reinforcing its image as a favourite for SaaS startups.

""I am guessing this (focus on healthcare and SaaS) is driven more by the legacy of healthcare and IT in the city,"" says Rohit Chennammeni, Co-founder, Darwinbox, an HR-tech startup.

Endiya's Ramesh Byrapaneni, a cardiologist-turned-investor, says that while the existing healthcare ecosystem has enabled the growth and development of several healthtech startups, a complete ecosystem would help.

""We already have large pharmaceutical companies and hospital chains here. What is needed is an ecosystem of interaction. Currently, I feel many startups lack an understanding of ground realities. If they begin working with the hospital chains and pharma companies, they can build solutions for real-world problems. I see that happening now,"" he says.

Healthtech startups based in Hyderabad include StanPlus, Nephroplus, Call Health and Ekincare.

Mahesh Lingareddy, Chairman of consumer tech firm Smartron, says, ""When we talk of startups, there has been a push or focus towards B2C or more consumer internet companies. Now, we believe there is a need for real product innovation. Hence, I founded Smartron out of Hyderabad. When I came back (from the US), I knew I wanted to do something more than IT services, which was strong in Hyderabad. I wanted to put product innovation from India on the world map.""

To this, Sujai adds that over the last 10 years, Indians have been slowly gravitating towards building businesses around hardware, both mechanical and electronics. ""We have companies that make wearables, electric bikes, IoT gadgets, and medical devices right here in Hyderabad. With Industrial Revolution 4.0, creating products has become democratised. Indian startups are bound to take advantage of this trend and T-Works will become a great enabler,"" he says.

""There is a redBus mafia, a Flipkart mafia, a FreeCharge mafia - we need something like that here,"" says Phanindra. ""Each of the larger companies should give birth to 30 more companies; that will create a vibrant ecosystem. We need one big ingredient - a strong mix of a mentorship network of people who have built large companies and old traditional businesses. At TSIC, we are working to bring in that round of collaboration,"" he adds.

While ThinCI might have created waves for Hyderabad, it is still missing a big name like Flipkart or Paytm.

Ramesh says the number of applications from students to be a part of CIE has gone up as against those from people with experience. ""There is an increased number of students willing to experiment and try out. Three years back, we had to build more awareness and tell students that they could look at entrepreneurship as an option. Today, students themselves approach us. However, there can still be more number of students coming in,"" he adds.

Over the last three years, Hyderabad has been going all guns blazing - from policies and infrastructure, to funding, mentorship and even education. What remains to be seen is how it succeeds and how the Hyderabad startup ecosystem evolves in the days to come."

The venue of a fan meet of Bollywood actor Aamir Khan was shifted to a hotel after a Chinese university denied permission to use its campus to promote his latest movie ""Thugs of Hindostan"". Khan is currently in China to promote ""Thugs of Hindostan"", which failed to register a strong performance in Bollywood and was panned by the critics. The movie, starring Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir and Katrina Kaif among others, was released on November 8 in India and is slated to release in the country next week.

The fan meet, which was scheduled in Guangdong University of Finance and Economics (GUFE) in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, was cancelled by the university over the failure to seek prior permission to use the campus, the Global Times reported. Around 350 people were supposed to attend the event. According to the Chinese media, the school did not know about the promotional event until Monday.

""The message was spread only among a small group of students through social media. The school only knew about it when students talked about the event hours before it was about to take place,"" the report quoted an employee of the university as saying. However, the Weibo account that promotes Khan's films announced the school had cancelled the event ""unilaterally"" as ""the students were overly enthusiastic"". The post angered many students, who said the university did not know about the event at all before Monday. Many students said they waited outside the event site for over an hour.

""It is obviously the organiser's fault for not applying to the school to use an on-campus building,"" net user Swim Xinzhu, a student from GUFE, said. ""We have held similar events before and there would be no issue if the organiser had reported in advance,"" an employee of the varsity said.

The organiser's deputy manager, a Beijing-based film-promoting company, reported the Weibo post by Khan's film account, saying they were contacting the film crew and the school to figure out what caused the poor communication. The fan meet was soon relocated to a Four Seasons hotel not far from the campus and ended at around 11 PM on Monday night, the report said. Khan is famous with his Dangal movie in China which was watched by President Xi Jinping. His other movie Secret Super Star has also become very famous in China raking up record box office earnings."

'But I am an actor first, and then an activist.'

'And I am not an accidental actor.'

'There was no way I was going to be dishonest with my acting,' Anupam Kher tells Veenu Sandhu.

It feels like a repeat of 2014. Back then, just as the country went into its longest-ever general election, a book was released that sent the prime minister's office into a tizzy and gave the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party another weapon to attack the ruling Congress and the prime minister, Dr Manmohan Singh.

While sympathetic to Singh, the book, The Accidental Prime Minister: The Making and Unmaking of Manmohan Singh, spoke about interference from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in the affairs of the PMO, attempts to give credit to Rahul Gandhi for key decisions taken by Dr Singh and his team, and Dr Singh's own resignation to the idea of who the real boss was.

The contents of the book, which was written by Dr Sanjaya Baru, DR Singh's former media adviser, were damning.

IMAGE: Important members of The Accidental Prime Minister cast.

Five years later, just as the country readies for another Lok Sabha election, a film based on the book is ready and is expected to hit theatres soon.

The Accidental Prime Minister has Anupam Kher playing Dr Singh and Akshaye Khanna as Dr Baru.

When news broke three years ago that Sunil Bohra, the co-producer of the critically acclaimed Gangs of Wasseypur, had bought rights for a film and that Kher would portray Dr Singh on screen, all manner of questions came to mind:

Would this be a propaganda movie?

Would the BJP fund it?

And why Kher, who had made his anti-Congress and pro-Narendra Damodardas Modi leanings amply clear?

Kher, Bohra and Vijay Ratnakar Gutte, the film's director, are at pains to put these speculations to rest.

""I have barely read two or three books in my life, but when I saw the cover of The Accidental Prime Minister at an airport, I was drawn to it,"" says Bohra.

After reading it, he was convinced it called for a movie. But none of the directors or the studios he approached was willing to touch it with a bargepole.

IMAGE: Anupam Kher with Director Vijay Ratnakar Gutte.

Finally, Gutte, a first-time director and Bohra's friend, came on board. The project, he felt, was tricky and challenging, but also exciting.

The first critical step was to find an actor who would convincingly essay Dr Singh's role -- without caricaturising him.

Kher became the top choice when the 'Manmohan Singh look' they gave to the pictures they had pulled off the Internet threw up an uncanny resemblance.

His facial features, smile and build all fit the image of the man. ""Kher had done over 500 films in versatile roles, so his acting credentials were also rock solid,"" says Gutte.

Armed with Baru's book, the film's first-look poster and Kher's 'Manmohan Singh' pictures, they approached the actor.

""He was shocked,"" recalls Gutte. ""His was a very public Modi bhakt image and he felt the whole thing would be seen in that light.""

IMAGE: German actress Suzanne Bernert plays Sonia Gandhi.

Speaking from the US, Kher agrees: ""I thought I'd be getting into the same political chakkar."" Besides, this role wasn't just difficult; it risked being a colossal failure.

Kher has done some tricky roles, in Khosla Ka Ghosla, A Wednesday!, Maine Gandhi Ko Nahin Mara (where he plays a man stricken with Alzheimer's), but those were all unknown characters.

""Singh is a very visible political leader. His contemporariness ensures that he is in everybody's psyche. There was no space for even a trace of me as an actor to appear here,"" he says.

But then if he agreed, this would also be his biggest role since Saaransh, his second film, which released 34 years ago and which is still hailed as his finest performance.

'Give me an exceptional script and I will consider it,' Kher told the director.

IMAGE: Arjun Mathur and Aahana Kumra play the Gandhi siblings, Rahul and Priyanka.

Adapting the complex and long book for film was, however, no cakewalk. Mayank Tewari, who co-wrote Newton, India's entry to the Oscars last year, came on board.

He got down to crunching the book and building a narrative that would give a voice to Dr Singh. Baru's character, the narrator, occupied important space.

But while Tewari retained his narration, he left out the opinion. This might have been a wise thing to do because, back in 2014, the PMO, while countering portions of the book, had also said that 'the commentary smacks of fiction and coloured views of a former adviser'.

""The effort has been to stay close to the spirit of the book,"" says Tewari, a former journalist. He equates Dr Singh with the Mahabharata's Bhishma Pitamah -- a figure who symbolised truth, devotion and sacrifice and who willingly embraced a life of loneliness for duty's sake.

When the book was released, Dr Singh's stock was already rock bottom. ""That has changed,"" says Tewari. ""The film will humanise him; it will rehabilitate him in the minds and hearts of people.""

Tewari has chosen the pragmatic route. He has retained key events that can be adapted to screen, such as Dr Singh's resilience on the nuclear deal with the US, the office politics and dealings with Pakistan. And he has left out chapters like 'Manmohan's Camelot', which deal with the intellectual engagements Dr Singh enjoyed.

IMAGE: Ram Avatar Bhardawaj plays Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

The idea of playing Dr Singh, meanwhile, kept preying on Kher.

""One day, I watched Singh's oath-taking ceremony on YouTube. And then as an exercise, I tried to walk like him. I was miles off the mark,"" he says.

If he were to pull this off with any dignity, 90 per cent would have to be about being the person and the remaining 10 per cent would rest on his acting skills.

Six months went into this preparation.

""I had to psych myself up. And then I meditated just to get his voice right.""

He watched footage after footage of Dr Singh. ""He doesn't express much and yet he has these many expressions -- happy, angry, sad, disappointed, lonely -- all within a small range,"" says Kher.

""Sometimes it's like looking at a picture and saying now it is happy, now sad or now triumphant.""

There is a scene in the film where you see Dr Singh walking down a long corridor, alone, his head tilted to one side and as though with a lifetime of experience resting on his slightly bent shoulders.

""And you see the loneliness of the man,"" says Kher. ""A key part of the role was to project not just his life, but also his philosophy.""

That's the magic of cinema, which a book might not be able to capture, he adds.

IMAGE: Avtar Sahni, left, plays Lal Kishenchand Advani, then the BJP leader.

Gutte spent seven days with Dr Baru in Delhi in January last year to understand what the PMO looks like, how it functions, what 7 Race Course Road (the prime minister's residence, which has since been renamed 7 Lok Kalyan Marg) is like, the protocol followed when the prime minister travels, how he engages with his daughters or his wife, Gursharan Kaur (played by Divya Seth Shah).

Casting the film's 163 characters took nine months. Teams were sent out across the country -- Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chandigarh -- to scout for people who could both look and act like these very public figures.

The one who finally made the cut to play Atal Bihari Vajpayee runs a tea stall; the one who plays Amar Singh comes from the same town as the former Samajwadi Party leader.

But the one who plays Sonia Gandhi -- German-born actor Suzanne Bernert -- practically barged into the film, laughs Gutte.

The team had nearly signed on another actress for the role when Bernert learnt of the character. ""She was in Germany and she bombarded us with messages, asking to be cast in the role,"" says Gutte. Her recorded audition sealed the deal.

IMAGE: Akshaye Khanna plays Dr Sanjaya Baru.

Then came recreating the PMO, the Lok Sabha and Rashtrapati Bhavan, all of which have a distinctive Lutyens's touch.

An ancient estate on the outskirts of London designed by Edwin Lutyens was chosen for the PMO. ""We could cheat neither with the characters nor with the places -- that's how familiar they all are,"" says Gutte.

Apart from the initial meetings with Gutte, Dr Baru says he has not been involved in the making of the film -- ""an adaptation"" based on the book and to be simultaneously released in Hindi, English, Tamil and Telugu.

""The book was written for an English language-book-reading audience while the film may be made for a larger cinema-viewing audience. So, some changes are inevitable,"" he says, adding that he has no idea what those changes might be.

One deviation is that the film has Priyanka Gandhi (played by Aahana Kumra) in it, while the book doesn't.

""It is impossible to tell this story without her,"" says Gutte. ""The book sets the context for the Gandhi family in a big way and we researched thoroughly and came up with material that is dramatic and truthful.""

IMAGE: Ajit Satbhaj plays P V Narasimha Rao, the former prime minister in whose Cabinet Dr Singh served as finance minister.

The book also talks about how Singh's principal secretary Pulok Chatterjee would seek 'instructions' from Sonia Gandhi on important PMO decisions. Some construed it as Chatterjee carrying files from the top office to Gandhi, which the PMO fiercely denied.

In his interviews Baru has also said he meant Chatterjee briefed Gandhi and not that he carried PMO files to her. It will be interesting to see how the film depicts this.

Meanwhile, the timing of the film does raise questions. Pankaj Pachauri, who was Singh's communications adviser when the book hit the stands, says back then the motive was financial gains, and this time too, it is the same. He calls the book a 'fictional account'.

While one cannot grudge the attempt to time a movie so that it is most profitable, The Accidental Prime Minister is a film about important personalities who are still in public life.

It is not a biopic, the film's team clarifies. Khanna says this is a light, enjoyable film that the audience will relate to.

""We are the world's largest democracy. It's a shame we don't make authentic political drama,"" he says. ""The Accidental Prime Minister attempts to change that. Finger-pointing and controversy before its release are inevitable,"" he says, ""but the film takes no sides.""

Film-maker Shyam Benegal, who headed the committee to recommend guidelines for certification of films, says ideally one should get permission from people whose lives are being portrayed, especially in a country where libel laws are strong.

""The rest depends on the discretion of the Central Board of Film Certification.""

Gutte says that, having applied for certification, he will openly answer whatever questions the CBFC might have.

Returning to Kher: Is it possible for an actor to put aside his politics while acting?

""People have a certain perception about my political leanings -- and rightly so. I have been very vocal in my criticism of Singh and the Congress and also in my appreciation of Prime Minister Modi,"" says Kher.

""But I am an actor first, and then an activist. And I am not an accidental actor. There was no way I was going to be dishonest with my acting.""

Kher describes the film as his best gift to his acting school, An Actor Prepares, and as a tribute to Dr Singh.

How the Congress will view it could be another story."

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Cracked walls in GMS, Palsora Colony make it impossible to warm the room. ""In such uncomfortable surroundings, students cannot focus on studies,"" said the parent of a school student.

Schools with concrete buildings do not have it easy either. Water seepage is a common problem. Leaky roofs, damp walls and rotting blackboards are common. School officials said they have informed authorities but the process of repair is slow.

""There is hardly any school that does not have the problem of water seepage and leaking roofs. One room or the other is always facing a problem,"" said Savinder Singh, chairman, Joint action committee of teachers.

""The education department must pressurize the engineering and public health department to conduct a thorough survey of all schools and act immediately,"" said Swarn Singh Kamboj, President, UT cadre, Educational Employees Union. According to them, seepage is a common problem faced by all government schools.

Afraid not - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"NEW DELHI: The scientific warnings that a high-intensity earthquake is likely to strike the Himalayas in the 'near future' have found backing in a new study that highlights how the ""enormous stacking up of strain"" in the region could lead to at least one earthquake of magnitude 8.5 or higher.

The study, headed, by seismologist C P Rajendran of Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, noted that after a massive earthquake sometime between 1315 and 1440, the central Himalayan region has stayed seismically quiet, though this implies that an enormous strain has built up in the geological region.

For Delhi, this is ominous because it is highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Experts say only around 20% of the city's buildings might withstand an 8.5-magnitude temblor. The capital is susceptible because it lies on three fault lines: the Sohna, Mathura and Delhi-Moradabad fault lines. Worse, Gurgaon has seven fault lines running across it.

""In the aftermath of the 2001 Gujarat quake, Delhi's seismic classification was revised from Zone III to Zone IV. However, all buildings designed and built before this, while standing, aren't compliant with the current seismic codes. I would say that only around 10% of the buildings in Delhi are earthquake resistant,"" cautioned Manit Rastogi of architectural company Morphogenesis and founder member of the green rating system, GRIHA Council.

Delhi attempted retrofitting of old buildings in 2008 and in 2015 after the Nepal quake when some complexes like Delhi Secretariat, Delhi Police and PWD headquarters, Ludlow Castle School, Vikas Bhawan, Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital and the Divisional Commissioner's Office were strengthened. PWD, which carries out regular strength assessment of government buildings, said retrofitting includes making the buildings accessible to differently abled persons.

Though the majority of Delhi government buildings are not seismic ready, PWD sources claimed they are under regular annual observation and maintenance, and regular work is carried to ensure they remain safe. ""All the government buildings are currently assessed to be safe, including from earthquake,"" a source said.

An older Union ministry of earth sciences study put locations on the Yamuna floodplain at highest risk in the event of an earthquake, including the highly populated residential colonies of east Delhi. Other high-risk places include Lutyens' Delhi, Sarita Vihar, Paschim Vihar, Wazirabad, Karol Bagh and Janakpuri. In terms of relatively safer areas, locations like JNU, AIIMS, Chattarpur, Naraina and Vasant Kunj might be able to withstand a mightly quake.

The North Delhi Municipal Corporation's annual dangerous building survey unearthed 229 precarious buildings in its areas. While SDMC reported zero 'unsafe' structures, EDMC reported one building. ""People should hire structural engineers to quake proof their buildings, even if these are being constructed in unauthorised areas,"" advised a senior corporation official."

For both plans, the school is asking their alumni for funds. Some of the renowned alumni of the school are actresses Vidya Balan, Shilpa Shetty and Shraddha Das. The school has planned events such as Alumni meet, minithons, a school fete called Anthonian Ensemble, which provides a platform for the school's budding artists, sportspersons, entrepreneurs and others.

Philomena Joseph, senior teacher and core committee member of the school, said, ""We are not able to accommodate all the children in the present building. The classrooms are also getting crowded, making the children uncomfortable. The school premises is almost 86-years-old. Some parts of the structure are pretty weak despite several renovations.

Claudette McDavid, whose husband, Harland, is the church's associate pastor, told the Times News that employees from the nearby Dollar General store on Carters Valley Road heard the roof collapse Sunday evening shortly before dark and contacted them.

""Evidently, it was just an act of nature,"" Mrs. McDavid told the Times News on Monday. ""Just too much snow. The roof came down and buckled out the walls. It came down on everything. There's one little part of it still standing where the steeple was.""

Aside from the sanctuary, the building at 5213 Carters Valley Road featured a nursery, sound room and restrooms, all of which were buried under snow and twisted metal.

""It looks like everything is gone,"" Mrs. McDavid said. ""We're on the phone with insurance people now. It was so bad last night by the time some of the church people got up there you really couldn't see, but my husband said it looks like it would all be destroyed. It fell from the back to the front, and doing that it bowed out both sides of the walls.""

Church member Rhonda Sellers said her husband and son were able to salvage a Bible from the 1800s, a church plaque and some pictures from the sanctuary.

Sellers said it was too dangerous to try to save more.

There's a large fellowship hall on the property for Sunday school, and that's where services will be held for the foreseeable future.

McDavid said she's just glad the Lord saw fit to let the roof fall when no one was inside the church.

""You never know what the Lord's plan is for us, but He always comes through,"" she added.

Aside from the church roof collapse, Hawkins County's weekend snow experience included a large number of fallen trees, power outages and one family evacuated when a tree fell through the roof of their mobile home in Poor Valley.

As of Monday afternoon, however, Hawkins County had no reported injuries attributed to Sunday's snow storm.

First thing Monday morning, Holston Electric was reporting more than 700 customers without power, but as of 2 p.m. Monday afternoon that number had been reduced to 538.

Hawkins County Emergency Management Agency Director Gary Murrell said this was a heavy, wet snow that caused an unusual number of fallen tree- and power-line issues.

""Holston Electric has been out working since early Sunday morning, but we've got places where it took poles down and everything,"" Murrell said. ""We had one incident at 951 Poor Valley Road where a tree fell into the residence. We went and got those people, and the Red Cross has put them up in a motel last night and tonight. Fallen trees are everywhere right now.""

As of Monday afternoon, War Valley Road between Goshen Valley Road to Burem Road was closed due to fallen trees, and Holston Electric was there working to get poles back up.

But Maggie bit off a little more than she could chew Sunday when it got over a foot deep at our house.

As an amateur dog psychiatrist, I'd love to know what she's thinking when I let her out to pee in the morning and inexplicably the ground is coated with this cold, white powdery stuff that wasn't there when we were playing Frisbee the night before.

Since I'm the one who feeds her, gives her treats and brings her home new toys, I'd like to think she credits me with providing this amazing new frozen wonderland.

More likely, in her mind the concept of ""why"" doesn't exist. This is her new reality, yesterday is forgotten and there is no tomorrow. All that matters is enjoying the moment.

Sunday morning, Maggie was enjoying the moment at first, and she hit the snow with her usual explosion of enthusiasm.

In the 22 years since I moved below the Mason-Dixon line, I can't remember seeing that much snow accumulation in such a short period of time.

It was definitely the most snow I've seen since Maggie arrived five years ago, and it didn't take her long to figure out something was different.

She was sinking in deeper, and it was taking a lot more effort for her to get back out. Usually she hops and prances effortlessly through the snow like a bunny rabbit.

She was hopping and prancing Sunday morning, albeit with a lot less gusto.

At one point, she stopped shoulder deep in snow and looked at me with an expression that said, ""This isn't really working for me.""

Eventually she worked her way onto the front porch overlooking a sea of white that was growing deeper before our very eyes. She scanned her domain for a moment, looked at me with disgust and went to the door.

""Let me in, Dad. I've had enough.""

Believe me, Maggie, I can relate. As a young pup, I loved playing in the snow, too. Then I got more then I could handle in January 1979.

Exactly one month from today will mark the 40th anniversary of Chicago's infamous ""Blizzard of 1979"".

Only a week removed from the end of our two-week Christmas break, the Blizzard of 1979 dumped so much snow on the Lake Michigan shoreline it took three weeks to get it cleaned up enough for schools to reopen.

During a 48-hour period of Jan. 12-14, we got more than 21 inches of snow, and that was on top of the 7 inches we had left over from New Year's Eve that hadn't melted yet.

You just can't imagine living with that much snow until you've seen it with your own eyes.

Roads were more like canyons with 20-foot high cliffs of snow piled in people's front yards. When they plowed the school parking lot, it created a pile of snow the size of a two-story farmhouse.

School was canceled, but a lot of us ended up at school anyway building elaborate forts with tunnels and slides in the massive snow pile. We had three or four forts in the same snow pile and attacked each other's forts with snow balls.

Snow drifts were so high against houses you could literally go sledding off your roof.

It was kid paradise for about three days. Then came the big freeze.

It went subarctic on us, with a wind-chill factor of 70-below-zero blowing off Lake Michigan. We woke up one morning to find our house doors completely frozen shut, held tight by a thick layer of ice around the door frame.

You couldn't stand to be outside for more than a couple of minutes at a time. That wind would cut you to the bone.

It seems like winters used to be a lot rougher than they are today, but the winter of 1979 was a REALLY rough one.

According to the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, Chicago's average annual snowfall is 33 inches and rarely exceeds 40 inches.

Since 1899, there have only been four Chicago winters when total snowfall exceeded 60 inches, but during the winter of 1979 we got 88.4 inches of snow.

By the end of January, there was an accumulation of more than 47 inches on the ground, most of which was compacted ice. We didn't even see the ground again until March.

It's hard to believe a 10-year-old would start missing school, but that's what happened.

A lad can only tolerate so much Campbell's soup, Monopoly, and Chutes and Ladders.

It's called Cabin Fever, and you can treat the symptoms with a steady dose of ""The Price is Right,"" ""The Gong Show"" and reruns of ""Gilligan's Island,"" ""The Monkees"" and ""Tom and Jerry.""

Within a week of confinement, you're going to crack up, and that's what started to happen to Maggie on Sunday afternoon. One day equals a week to her, but she was starting to crack up by lunchtime.

You can keep her occupied for a while with her stuffed cow or a ball, but eventually she's back at the door wanting to go out and play.

Then the same scenario plays itself out. ""Up to my chin in snow. This isn't any fun. Let me back in.""

Fortunately for Maggie, yesterday is forgotten and all that matters is enjoying the moment. And at the moment the snow has melted back down to a level she can enjoy."

However, the owner of the school, who identifies himself as a leader of Samajwadi Party's youth wing Yuvjan Sabha, is absconding.

The principal, Sanjeev Jha, an original resident of Sitamarhi district in Bihar, was arrested by Sector 49 police from near Arogyadhan Maharshi Ashram, Sector 107 on Tuesday.

While Amit Bhati, who identifies himself as the state secretary of Yuvjan Sabha, is the chairman and owner of KM Public School, his uncle Deshraj Bhati is the owner of the adjacent plot where an earthmover was levelling the land, resulting in the wall collapse.

The students were sitting near the wall in the open and writing an exam when the wall collapsed on them. While two students died, five others were injured.

So far, Sector 49 police has booked Amit Bhati, his uncle Deshraj Bhati, Deshraj's son Sumit Bhati, school manager Raghvendra Solanki, principal Sanjeev Jha and the unidentified driver of the earthmover.

Meanwhile, a visit to the spot indicates that Amit is well-known in the area. A board installed at the entry of the lane to his three-storey house reads: Amit Bhati, pradesh sachiv (state secretary), Samajwadi Party Yuvjan Sabha. He is also well-known as the owner of multiple properties in the village, most of which have been given on rent.

Since Monday morning, when the tragedy struck, Amit and his kin have gone missing while his house remains locked. ""They are not here. The family has gone missing since the incident,"" said a neighbour.

Asked whether Amit was active in the party's youth wing, Gajendra, a villager, told TOI that Amit was seen during different campaigns and activities of the party. ""You can see the board installed here right at the entry of the lane. The family belongs to the village and owns land here,"" he said, pointing to the board.

In the village, many don't want to talk about Amit and his family.

""We live in the building rented out by the family. They own many buildings here,"" said the aunt of one of the children who got injured in the wall collapse.

While the party has officially denied that Amit was a member, some leaders admitted that he had indeed been associated with the party's activities and had even participated in meetings of the Yuvajan Sabha in Noida prior to the disbanding of the youth outfit last year.

""He used to follow a cabinet minister from the state and was actively involved in the party prior to the feud between the Shivpal and Akhilesh factions,"" said a local leader.

Surendra Nagar, Rajya Sabha MP from the SP, told TOI that Amit does not hold even primary membership of the party. ""There are some people who tend to use the party's name. However, he is not even a primary member,"" he said.

According to villagers, the school had been running for the past years but its responsibility was handed over to Solanki and Jha on profit-sharing basis. The responsibility to manage the school was handed over to the duo after changing its name from Khajan memorial to KM Public School last year.

Meanwhile, the students who had been recuperating in two different hospitals are out of danger.

One of the children, Akash (9), who was seriously injured, underwent two surgeries at Yatharth hospital on Tuesday in his right leg and thigh and a rod has been inserted in his leg.

Akhilesh Kumar, father of seven-year-old Amit told TOI that the children -Amit, Naitik and Ashish -- are yet to recover from their injuries. SSP Ajay Pal Sharma told TOI that the teams are out to hunt for the other accused."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 per cent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational centre, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training centre"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemies of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training centre featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the centre is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 per cent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, but they are also now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith. ""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city centre.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Oh God. One more remix,"" one hears Karan Johar's voice in the recent trending song Aankh maare, from the film Simmba. Johar's one-liner echoes the sentiment of the nation, when almost every film has a recycled and rehashed version of an old hit anthem. Aankh maare had 1,05,092,941 views on YouTube, in two weeks. It first appeared in the film Tere Mere Sapne (1996), and has been ""recreated"" by music director Tanishk Baghchi. Even if you don't register the name, it's near impossible you have missed the sound that Bagchi creates -- Hawa hawai (Tumhari Sulu), Rashke qamar (Badshaho), Dilbar (Satyameva Jayate) and even Tum ko hum pe pyar aaya from the yet-to-be released Zero.

The Kolkata-born musician clarifies that his music is a recreation and not a remix alone. ""There is a huge difference between a recreation and a remix. The first song that I recreated was Humma humma from Bombay for Ok Jaanu. Almost everyone in the music industry has remixed this song, but I always felt that they spoiled it -- it kept giving the feel of a club mix. One can't pay homage or a tribute to an iconic anthem with a measly club mix. To recreate it, an anthem -- we need the research and intention in place,"" says the 39-year-old. He adds, ""I wish to create a bridge between the old and the new. At least when they put the song on YouTube, some other song suggestions will also come, which otherwise people won't listen to. I know even when people listened to Aankh maare, they were like kharaab kar diya. But honestly when was the last time they heard the old Arshad Warsi version? Aisa toh nahin hai ki as if they are listening to that song on loop.""

Born to parents who were music teachers -- a Punjabi mom and a Bengali father -- music was something Bagchi ran from, not towards. ""Music was around me. I was not keen to be a musician -- as I felt there was no money in it. When you have no money, then the fruition of your passion takes a long time. I didn't think that I had the patience for a long-drawn-out struggle. I had plans to be a pilot in the Air Force but because of an injury, early on, I couldn't materialise this dream,"" adds Bagchi, an almunus of City College, Kolkata.

School and college fests catapulted him to the stage, where he sang and performed -- something that was an uphill task for the introvert. ""Even today when I have to step out for a meeting, or a social event, I have to really prep. I am quite happy being in my studio with my work. But back then, I slowly edged into it and my mother said that I should keep at my music. I started teaching. I also collaborated with some DJs in Kolkata, where they started using my original compositions and spinning them in nightclubs. I wrote my own songs,"" says Bagchi.

In early 2000s he landed in Mumbai, at the behest of his father. He composed bhajans for Sanskar channel -- and slept in the same office. It's then he met with his now frequent collaborator Vayu. They put up a song on YouTube, which got two lakh views -- and a meeting with Anurag Kashyap. Things moved up when he met with director Aanand L Rai, and the work for his first song Banno, for the film Tanu Weds Manu Returns, began. ""We met Aanand Sir, and he told us about the situation - an open brief of a shaadi -- and he said that he liked the zone that we both came from. That's how Banno tera swagger came into being. It was the first break for us,"" adds the song producer.

There has been no looking back for Bagchi. Almost every hit film has his songs -- original and recreations. His name has popped up even on Koffee with Karan this season, twice. He has also been at the receiving end for barbs and brickbats -- for his recreations. ""People think that recreations are no work, ki bas bass badha do, beats daal do. I have approached every recreations as if they are 100 per cent new songs. I got the Golmaal team in it, used the hee-ho-ha, thing. I only take the melody from the old school, I only get the hook. For a recreation, I line up more than 500 sounds for the song.It's like breaking an old building and taking it into a redevelopment. Main SRA building tod raha hun aur ek tower khada kar rahan hun, ,"" adds Bagchi, who attributes Bally Sagoo as the one great remake king. ""I am kicked about next year. I have more than 100 songs coming out,"" he says, signing off."

While there's a lot resting on the Fed move and whatever Fed Chair Jerome Powell says afterward at his press conference, at the end of the day, no matter what he does, the ping pong of tariffs doesn't go away. The overlying theme is still tariffs. Companies are still trying to figure out what the rules of the game might be, and that's affecting their desire and ability to spend.

With December off to the month's worst start in 38 years, there seems to be more hanging on this gathering than any other recently. Some economists have urged the Fed to delay another hike, but arguably that might make things even worse for the markets. People could interpret that as a sign of the Fed being increasingly worried about the economy.

Futures trading puts chances of a hike at 71% as of early Tuesday, which might indicate a likely raise perhaps accompanied by dovish ""wait and see"" language about 2019. One school of thought is that with all the pressure on the Fed, this might be the last hike for a while.

Until the Fed decision, investors could see slow trading. That's often the case when a Fed decision looms. There's a more positive tone early Tuesday after Monday's sell-off, but it's hard to feel too much optimism with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down around 1,000 points over the last two sessions alone and the S&P 500 index sitting just above its low for the year (set yesterday). We've seen this movie before. Every recent rally attempt has fizzled out, bringing major indices back down to flat or even lower by the end of the session. It might be a moral victory to see this early buying simply hold up.

As the Fed meeting loomed, some positive data came out early Tuesday from the housing market. November housing starts and building permits both hit it out of the park, easily exceeding Wall Street analysts' expectations. The market, however, didn't seem to get any immediate boost from the numbers.

A sell-off that rolled into the weekend picked up pace Monday, taking all the major U.S. indices to 2% losses for the second-straight session and setting a new 2018 closing low for the S&P 500. The storyline didn't change much from Friday, with investors still apparently squeamish about slowing overseas economic prospects and chances of a rate hike from the Fed later this week.

Though the SPX remains a long way from entering an official bear market (down 20% from the high), it is down 13% from the year's closing peak, and all of the FAANG stocks that helped drive momentum earlier this year are in bear territory. Also, the small-cap Russell 2000 index (RUT) is now officially in a bear market. Barron's observed over the weekend that many small companies are burdened with issues like high valuations, slowing revenues, margin pressure, or excess leverage.

If you like slasher movies, this might be the market for you, with bleeding in every sector. Even so-called ""defensive"" neighborhoods like utilities took a dive on Monday. There's also a mess in the commodity pits, where crude crumbled to close below $50 a barrel for the first time in over a year. Another industrial commodity, copper, fell too. By early Tuesday, U.S. crude prices were well under $49, burdened by heavy supplies and booming production pretty much anywhere you look around the world.

Meanwhile, volatility spiked close to 15% as measured by the VIX, which rose back toward levels near 25 seen during the October sell-off.

Recent dollar strength hasn't been a very welcome Christmas gift for some of the major U.S. multinationals, including those bellwethers of trade with China, namely Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). Both have been hit pretty hard over the last month or so, but then again, who hasn't? Anyway, some positive news from BA came out late Monday when the company said it planned to raise its dividend 20% and increase stock buybacks. It cited strength in its business and confidence in its outlook, and shares rose in post-market trading. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) also announced a $5 billion buyback. It might be worth watching to see if some other deep-pocketed companies try similar strategies here in the depths of this sell-off, perhaps trying to pull investors back in even as their stocks come under pressure.

Another positive for any company would be solid earnings, and that's what Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) appeared to deliver after the close Monday, beating Wall Street analysts' top- and bottom-line expectations. Shares rose around 4% in post-market trading, but ORCL remains down for the year. The company continues to transition into the cloud business, seeing year-over-year revenue fall slightly during the quarter, so it's not necessarily out of the woods.

As ugly as things have gotten, the selling still seems orderly. What does that mean? It means there's no sign of a real panic, which would be the case if we saw aggressive selling of stocks and buying of risk-off products like bonds, gold, and the VIX. This hasn't been a true ""dump"" of stocks, and there hasn't been a major spike in volatility.

What might be happening is that many investors who bought the dip the first time the market went down back in October didn't benefit, and now they're apparently not so willing to buy the next dip. It looks like many investors are willing to own stocks for now, but the question is whether at some point they start to throw up their hands and panic. So to sum up, it's not like everyone is rushing for the exits, but there's just not a lot of desire to buy, partly because of the tariff overhang. Think about how orderly this downturn has been. It probably reflects a lack of buyers, not panic selling.

Also, there's some technical stuff to consider keeping in mind. The SPX managed to close just a touch under the psychological 2600 mark last week, but then fell through technical support below that at 2570 by late Monday. That set up a test of 2530, just under the intraday low for the year of 2532 posted back in February.

By late Monday, the SPX had fallen below 2532 to set a new low for the year before swinging up slightly to end the day. Some analysts say there might be a gap in support below 2530 that extends down to near the 2400 level, which is a long way to fall. Such a drop would put the SPX within a couple of percentage points of falling into bear territory for the first time since the 2008-09 economic crisis. That means 2530 could remain the level to watch when trading starts Tuesday.

With the SPX down more than 5% for the year and facing a possible annual loss for the first time since 2015, the question might be whether the market is baking in too negative a forward outlook. Here's why. In 2015, as the SPX fell just under 1% for the full year, earnings were also on the decline.

In what analysts then called an ""earnings recession,"" quarterly S&P 500 earnings fell the final three quarters of 2015, with a worse than 3% year-over-year performance in Q4. Things are a lot different now. The market is falling, but earnings have been impressive all year. They've risen more than 20% the last two quarters, and many analysts still expect mid-teens growth for Q4. Looking into 2019, the picture weakens, but it's still not an earnings ""recession"" if current estimates of mid-to-high single-digit earnings growth don't fall.

However, as an analyst on CNBC noted Monday, the SPX is behaving now as if there's not going to be any earnings growth at all next year. The forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio now stands at about 15, according to Factset, barely above the 10-year average (which includes the depths of the 2008-09 economic crisis), and down from 18 or higher earlier this year. So either the market is right and earnings next year have farther to fall, or the market is aiming too low, meaning you could argue the SPX is underpriced at current levels. This is a debate that's not going to be decided anytime soon, but could make for interesting viewing as the new year rolls in.

From a U.S. data perspective, things continue to look pretty good, though Monday's Empire Manufacturing number for December came in well under expectations. Some of the interest rate-sensitive sectors like cars and housing continue to come under pressure, but wages and job growth still look strong even while inflation remains manageable. The only thing is, jobs and wages are sometimes seen by economists as trailing indicators, meaning they can be the last statistics to go up in a rising economy.

There are a couple of things particularly relevant to this week that investors might want to keep in mind. First, there's earnings from a bunch of companies, including Oracle, FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Nike (NYSE:NKE). There's also quadruple witching on Friday, marking the simultaneous expiry of stock index futures, stock index options, stock options & single stock futures. This can result in volatility as traders unwind positions.

Also, many hedge funds and traders are measured this week in terms of bonuses, so they may be unloading any positions they have that are still up for the year.

Figure 1: Technical Points to Ponder. The breakout to the downside has many chart watchers eyeing possible levels of technical support. Today's low in the S&P 500 Index (SPX) of 2530 eclipsed the February low of 2532, but a bit of end-of-day support kept the SPX from a settlement at a new low. Looking beyond that level to the downside, some point to the night of the 2016 election, when a head-fake break down to 2083 turned to breakout rally that seemed to be a one-way train until it derailed in February 2018. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform from TD Ameritrade. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results.

Thank Goodness It's (Not) Friday? Lately, Fridays just haven't been kind to bullish investors. The S&P 500 fell on three of the last four Friday sessions, with steep losses on the last two, especially. One school of thought suggests investors are nervous about what sorts of developments might happen over the weekend, so they could be taking profit ahead of time. This is sometimes the kind of thing you see in volatile markets like this where geopolitical issues are swirling and headlines frequently drive price movements. People are afraid of the next shoe to possibly drop.

GAAP Gap? Speaking of earnings and P/E ratios, one thing to consider keeping an eye out for in Q4 earnings is any widening of GAAP and adjusted results in company reports. As a reminder, GAAP stands for ""Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,"" but tends to get overlooked in media and sell-side analyst reports, where adjusted earnings pull in most of the headlines. Adjusted earnings are simply that -- ""adjusted"" to leave out any issue the company considers relevant to only the quarter in question. Those factors get covered by the GAAP earnings, meaning adjusted is sometimes considered the best way to track a company's long-term performance unencumbered by one-time costs like an expense associated with closing a factory or paying for a product recall.

Still, when times get tough, companies have been known to stretch the definition of ""one time,"" so they can ensure that adjusted earnings meet or exceed Wall Street analysts' projections. This doesn't mean they're breaking any laws, only that adjusted earnings might tell a brighter story than GAAP earnings do. When the ""gap"" between GAAP and adjusted widens, then it might be time for investors to wonder if companies are starting to use fancy accounting to make up for any problems and still meet their own or Wall Street's projections on the adjusted line. If that seems like the case, it might be worth taking a closer look at the individual company's performance to see if issues deeper down in its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings reflect any issues for concern. Though it may seem daunting, if you really have a large position in a company's stock, it's probably a good idea to read through the key parts of its most recent 10-K filing and be aware of the company's major challenges (outlined in that filing). Then you can think of how that might eventually spill over into the bottom line and potentially affect the company's P/E.

Pressure on Fed Mounts: As the Fed gathers today, it's coming under increased pressure to adopt a more dovish strategy. An op-ed Monday in The Wall Street Journal co-written by Kevin Warsh, a former member of the Fed's Board of Governors, warned the Fed to take note of slowing overseas economic growth, softening credit markets, and falling commodity prices. It was titled, ""Fed Tightening? Not Now."""

From its fighting mechanics to the very philosophies it is built upon, it tries to harken back to those games, while attempting to carve out an identity of its own to use European folklore as inspiration for its setting, world building, and characters. Naturally, we've been quite curious about the game, and as such, not too long ago, we sent across a few of our questions to the developers. The following questions were answered by AOne Games' Sebastian Gana and Felipe Muñoz.

""We've always been horror fans, and love the classic monsters from the many interpretations in film and literature and comic books through the years. It's such a rich tapestry to draw from, and so recognizable and beloved worldwide that we felt it was an obvious fit for a fighting game.""

Omen of Sorrow features a very unique tone and aesthetic, drawing from European folklore and mythologies. What inspired you to go in that direction?

Sebastian Gana: We've always been horror fans, and love the classic monsters from the many interpretations in film and literature and comic books through the years. It's such a rich tapestry to draw from, and so recognizable and beloved worldwide that we felt it was an obvious fit for a fighting game. Getting the chance to give them our own twist is, frankly, a treat in itself, too.

Fighters don't typically focus on narrative aspects much. How does Omen of Sorrow differ from other games in the genre in this regard? What can players expect from the story mode?

Felipe Muñoz: We made a big effort to create a mythology around these characters so as to pit them against one another in a way that was meaningful to them, and that also gave us fertile ground to create more stories in the future. It's an ambitious thing, to worldbuild in a fighting game without the kind of budget other games have, but we wanted to tell our own stories, and make these characters our own. We wanted to make a story mode where you could tell that these characters were living in a world that was real to them, even if not all the details or all the stories in it have been told to the player-yet!

What prompted you to make a fighter that was decidedly inspired by the arcade, classic days of the genre?

Sebastian Gana: I remember with a lot of nostalgia how, back in the 90's, going to the Arcades was the only fun thing to do in the little town my family would take me on vacations every year. So, every year, for two months I would do nothing but go to the Arcades. Street Fighter 2 was the most popular game back then, and everybody was playing it. I wasn't as good as some other players, but I had such a great time just watching. I remember how when Mortal Kombat came out it blew my mind, too. I was never any good, but I still loved to just watch and analyze other players playstyles. I loved secret characters being a thing, and how in Mortal Kombat just getting to fight Reptile was a reward in itself. In Omen of Sorrow we wanted to bring some of that old-schooly feel to the current generation of fighting games, and so we have two characters who have to be unlocked-but you have to do it on your own. In terms of mechanics, Felipe Muñoz was responsible for designing the mechanics and the way characters fight, as well as updating the old-school ideas we had for the game into a more modern kind of fighting game. That's how we ended up with a very western-looking fighting game that nonetheless feels very Japanese in terms of mechanics.

""We wanted to make a fast paced fighting game that in some ways felt like a callback to older fighting games.""

Can you tell us about the unique abilities and fighting styles of the different character types?

Felipe Muñoz: We wanted to make a fast paced fighting game that in some ways felt like a callback to older fighting games. With this in mind, we designed a fast paced, grounded game, but made sure to give every character a more flavorful interpretation than older games used to be able to. So, many of our different fighters have very distinctive playstyles, even if the core mechanics of the game are more old-schooly and less flashy. We have characters like Vladislav III who, armed with many teleports and a strong chain combo, has very good runaway capacity and nonetheless explosive damage, or Radegonda, who is very clunky on the ground and must sacrifice a lot of her stronger options if she wants to be able to take the initiative at any given time, but who becomes incredibly versatile and mobile while in the air. There's also characters like Imhotep, with strong ranged options and the ability to setup big damage, but not any good options to run away. Cool character design is one of the ways in which we wanted to make the game feel more unique and new, as a way to balance out all the classic callbacks present in other aspects of design.

How important is stage design in classic fighters- more specifically, how important is it in Omen of Sorrow? Can you talk to us a bit about the process of developing those and what went on behind the scenes in terms of decisions regarding design?

Felipe Muñoz: Stage design, usually, is not that big a deal in fighting games. Generally speaking, the stages are just a background for the fights to take place. However, in Omen of Sorrow, we had so many cool things to cite, so many iconic locations to make use of, that we put special attention to the stages. As far as the process of developing them, I don't know if there's that much to say! We really wanted to callback some of the most iconic imagery of the classic monsters. Locations like Dr. Frankenstein's Lab or the burning windmill or Count Dracula's Castle are all so cool that we would have felt in debt if we hadn't used them. Other than that, we also made sure to hide easter eggs of all kinds in the stages, just because we could. We really wanted to make the game look cool in every sense, and so we spared no expense into making the stages look as cool as we could manage. It was as much a labor of love as any other aspect of the game.

Impressions on the game have been pretty good, but a few people have mentioned that the game seems to be a bit lacking in content. How do you plan on tackling these complaints?

To this date we've released several patches, specifically to address the biggest complaints we've heard and the worst problems we've been having, such as the loading times. We're planning to address every big problem we've heard from the community; for instance, we're about to launch a big update that should fix many issues with the AI, so it's more challenging than the one we have now.

""Before we can confirm or deny any rumors about a Switch version, the logical step to take would be to try and see if the game runs correctly on that platform.""

Do you have any plans to launch on Switch?

Before we can confirm or deny any rumors about a Switch version, the logical step to take would be to try and see if the game runs correctly on that platform. For that, we would need Nintendo devkits to arrive to Chile in order to run such tests and make sure the gameplay is as fluid as we need it to be. If those tests go well, then we could maybe share some good news.

Does the game will feature PS4 Pro specific enhancements? What can players expect if they are playing the game on PS4 Pro? Is 4K/60fps on the cards?

If I'm not mistaken, today there's no fighting game with 3D graphics that runs at native 4k/60fps in PS4 Pro and that, I imagine, is due to the fact that fighting games have to be very stringent about their framerate. During development, we did test a 4k native resolution and it slowed the game down considerably. We chose to put gameplay first.

What I don't discard, however, is HDR, which we still have to properly research. It could help Omen of Sorrow's visuals a ton.

And how does the base PS4 version turn out in terms of resolution and frame rate?

In the regular PS4, the game will keep functioning as it's supposed to, at 60fps, which is the standard for this kind of fighting game. In terms of resolution, it will keep running at 1080p.

Next gen is coming sooner or later. From a development perspective, what is your biggest expectation from PS5 and Xbox Scarlett?

Every new console generation means a hardware update, which is great for making things look better. For the same reason, it rises production costs; since reaching a higher visual standard becomes more and more complex (more resources and more manpower). In any case, there's many games that shine strictly for their gameplay, and have no need for better hardware to be masterpieces (such as Braid). To be entirely honest, it's hard for me to imagine what kind of novelty the next generation of consoles may bring other than better hardware. Things like VR don't seem like the right path to me as it's isolating and not very conducive to social dynamics, which is a very important aspect of gaming-not to mention it can be pretty uncomfortable. I think some sort of innovation in the social aspects of gaming is the proper way forward for future generations.

""Nowadays, the matchmaking services of Playstation, Xbox, Steam, etc. are a tool for developers not to spend too much time developing their own server technologies. However, this splits the userbase. Anybody would want to be able to play and match with players in any platform. This is something we've believed since the beginning, which is why, other than building Omen of Sorrow, we created our own server and matchmaking technology we call ""Game Weaver"" in order to accept Cross-Play.""

Do you think cross platform will be one of the defining features of next-gen consoles?

I think it could happen even before the next generation comes along. Epic Games is opening the doors for that to happen with Fortnite in Playstation. Today, the barriers are mostly political-commercial. Nowadays, the matchmaking services of Playstation, Xbox, Steam, etc. are a tool for developers not to spend too much time developing their own server technologies. However, this splits the userbase. Anybody would want to be able to play and match with players in any platform. This is something we've believed since the beginning, which is why, other than building Omen of Sorrow, we created our own server and matchmaking technology we call ""Game Weaver"" in order to accept Cross-Play. We hope to keep working on it and perfecting it in time, validating it with users, as well as maybe experiment a bit with new mechanics online and Omen of Sorrow."

According to the Chinese media, the school did not know about the promotional event until Monday.

""The message was spread only among a small group of students through social media. The school only knew about it when students talked about the event hours before it was about to take place,"" the report quoted an employee of the varsity as saying.

However, the Weibo account that promotes Khan's films announced the school had cancelled the event ""unilaterally"" as the ""the students were overly enthusiastic"".

The post angered many students, who said the university did not know about the event at all before Monday.

Many students said they waited outside the event site for over an hour.

""It is obviously the organiser's fault for not applying to the school to use an on-campus building, net user Swim Xinzhu, a student from GUFE, said.

""We have held similar events before and there would be no issue if the organiser had reported in advance,"" an employee of the varsity said.

The organiser's deputy manager, a Beijing-based film-promoting company, reported the Weibo post by Khan's film account, saying they were contacting the film crew and the school to figure out what caused the poor communication.

The fan meet was soon relocated to a Four Seasons hotel not far from the campus and ended at around 11 PM on Monday night, the report said."

The four students, Aryan Chaubal, Zyfn Kothavala, Neel Acharya and Sanjana Basavraj, were part of a team (27 member group of students of age group 10-16) from Victorious Kidss Educares, St Mary's School and the Bishops School.

Cozmo clench competition requires the participants to complete 'pick and place' tasks, through an obstacle course, with their robots within six minutes. Each of these teams have to build their own unique robots to solve the problem, said a statement issued by IIT Bombay techfest team for Cozmo clench competition.

The team, which with Aryan as the captainwon the competition, completed the tasks in a record time of one minute and 26 seconds and scored 464 points overall. ""They won the competition by a huge margin as the team that secured the second position in the finals had completed the tasks in three minutes andwere constantly practising in their IIT hostels and had a fixed strategy for each of the tasks that they were running through and kept improving throughout the three days,""said Mallick.

""This helped them improve their timings with their well-designed and robust robots which is our focus of study and where we encourage the students to build innovative instructional programmes in robotics, automation education and developing educational robots and kits,"" he added.

Aryan Chaubal, Class 9 student, said,""We were a group of 4 students, all working together under the guidance of our teachers at Lydnow Robotics during our brainstorming sessions and we came up with new problems, new solutions and most importantly new ideas. But that's the essence of brainstorming, you put anything and everything that you can think of down on paper, this way you can eradicate setbacks and furthermore create viable design ideas that you have your trust in.""

Zyfn Kothavala (13) , a student of The Bishop's School, Camp, who was also part of the team, said,""Our focus when we started was to find an optimal solution for the Cozmo Clench problem statement. We finally settled on a wired robot, with a rotating base that could place the block anywhere in a 180 degree radius. We spent about two months building it, working every Saturday from morning to evening. The benefits of the selected approach were that we moved the complexity into the remote and having a turntable gave the robot great flexibility. We were incredibly excited to hear that we had won after a thrilling and satisfying Techfest 2018.""

The students were trained by Lydnow Robotics, Pune. The teams were sent to enter the wild card round held on December 14 and 15 at IIT, Bombay.The wild card round offers on spot opportunity to participants to secure a spot in the final rounds of the competition. Generally, wild card rounds are for students and teams that are not able to participate in the zonal rounds. Wild card rounds see the most fierce competition in the entire tournament due to it do or die format.

""At least 100 teams participated in the wild card round and 10 teams were to be selected based on their performance and points scored. These 10 teams would then proceed to the finals where they would compete along with teams that previously qualified through zonal competitions held in September 2018. Three teams from Lydnow Robotics made it to the top 10 in the wild card round and on December 16, this team of four made it to the finals and won it,"" said Arijit Mallick, founder, director - training, Lydnow Robotics.

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on US college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the US Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said _ barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees _ or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there _ are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

''The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,'' he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ''Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.''

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

''American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,'' she said. ''What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?''

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ''vocational skills education and training center'' in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

''Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,'' the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ''global issue.''

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ''unproblematic,'' he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

''We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,'' Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

''I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,'' one Uighur student said. ''The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.''

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ''military facility.'' Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ''apparel employment training base.''

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ''Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person'' and ''No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.''

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

''There are watchtowers throughout,'' Ruser said. ''There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.''

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ''friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.''

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

''We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,'' he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the US, Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the US that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ''training'' there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""US consumers should not be buying and US businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the US

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ''political training.'' The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

''They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,'' said Kaliaskar. ''What's the point of this training?''

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ''further education.''

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

''They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,'' she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

For a blind person, it's a chance to see. For a needy person, it's a helping hand. For a child, it's a support system, arms stretched out, ready to believe in them.

One such ray of hope is the HOPE Project that works in collaboration with the Centre for Catalyzing Change (C3) Unniti Small Grants Program which works towards providing education to children from underprivileged sections for their better future.

The HOPE Project works from Nizammudin Basti and they have opened a school in the area where the kids are given basic primary education and are taught to develop various skills. In the first batch of boys in an all-girls school were three children- Sohail, Nimesh and Kunal.

""Nobody knew where the kids were from. The kids, when they came for the first time, had this apprehension, fear of rejection and being stigmatised. But with time, they got over the anxiety and the fear and have come out as amazing photographers and dancers and are now working towards achieving their dreams. Children who could not even think of going to school are now giving university exams."", says Richa Sundra, Manager of the Centre for Catalyzing Change Foundation.

""We at C3 Unniti Small Grants Program believe in the philosophy of redefining the conventional process of grant giving with a spirit of co-travelling with our partners. The support is small, yet highly effective in building and supporting programs , building the capacity of the organisation towards sustainability and supporting women and girls to develop their full potential"", says Dr. Aparajita Gogoi, Executive Director, Centre for Catalyzing Change.

Sundra and Samiur Rahman, Executive Director of The Hope Project foundation, came together, and brought three boys from an NGO named Katkatha, who help women and children living in the brothels of GB Road, New Delhi, to Hope Project, for an experiment, to secure a better future by bringing those children into the mainstream education.

""The mandate was that we wanted to transform the lives of the children, not even change them. Till date, we have mainstreamed the lives of about 14,000 children. A very important landmark is 37 children from Hope, are going to the university, so you can well imagine the next generation"", Rahman adds. ""Over the years we have been able to win the confidence of the community and others, especially the parents, and the guardians. This kind of population has a different kind of history and story. Its 3 years, now that boys are included in as well.""

Rehman says, ""My kids have been to the children's parliament, and last year they were even nominated to meet the Swiss president, and one of them spoke before the Swiss president. I accept challenges and I do it. Fear is nothing, and fear can never stop me from doing something correct.""

Nimesh, one among the three boys, says, ""We have been here for five years. The best thing that I like about HOPE Project is the unity here. When we first came here, we were a little anxious since we never went to a proper school before. But when we started spending time here, we started liking the place a bit more. And now, this is our favourite.""

Nimesh's one talent that he found during his time here, was photography. ""I recently had my photos shown in an exhibition here which was held for two days. I also made a documentary on the red light area of Delhi, which was awarded the first prize. I bought a camera with the prize money"", he happily adds.

Nimesh was also awarded the Ashoka Fellowship for Young Social Entrepreneurs.

Its stories like Nimesh's that show that all that a child needs is someone who believes in them, and encourages them. It's organizations that the C3 Unniti Small Grants Programme and the HOPE Project that make it happen."

Another thing which Maria discoverd was that their classmates had a good rapport with each other, but Rupal and she were left out of it.

It's not a boat. It's a ship. And that's you and me. So it's actually a..... FRIENDSHIP!"" Rupal burst out laughing. Maria tried not be amused. But she was. She smiled. ""And let us take our big ship and journey into pirate territory. Let's go on an adventure.""

""Where to?""

Rupal dragged her out of the class and down the steps and across the playground and past the car park and through the kindergarten play area and stopped in front of a row of big neem trees. Behind the trees was an old office building. It had not been in use for four or five years. There was one room that was used to store the sports supplies, but students were not allowed into the room. The building was off-limits.

""Why do you think that building is not being used? It doesn't look old or damaged,"" Rupal said, as she peered through the trees at the building. The windows were sealed from the inside. Leaves from the neem formed a carpet. It was a distance from the rest of the school and so was quiet. ""What if they are hiding some treasure in it? Maybe they found gold and diamonds in the walls?""

Maria stuck her head between two trees beside Rupal. ""Last week, there was a news story that a man in a village had dug up a pot of coins in his backyard,"" she said. ""But he was forced to give it to the police for some reason.""

""So, if there is gold inside it means that whoever found it does not want to give it to the police. They are hiding it from them,"" she finished.

When she turned to look at Maria her eyes were shining like gold coins themselves! ""Just imagine if we found out and told the police. We would be heroes!""

Maria was excited but also a bit scared. ""But, if there's nothing in there, then we could get into big trouble. Thrown out of school, even,"" she said.

""True. But let's take a quick peek. That's all."" And with that Rupal squeezed through the trees and sped off. Maria hesitated a minute. But the smell of adventure was too tempting. In a jiffy she too joined Rupal who was peering through a gap in one of the boarded up windows. The girls could not see anything. They went to the back. It was over grown with creepers.

They were among hundreds of thousands who had been detained and spent month after month renouncing their religious convictions. Now the government was showing them on television as models of repentance, earning good pay -- and political salvation -- as factory workers.

China's ruling Communist Party has said in a surge of upbeat propaganda that a sprawling network of camps in the Xinjiang region is providing job training and putting detainees on production lines for their own good, offering an escape from poverty, backwardness and the temptations of radical Islam.

But mounting evidence suggests a system of forced labour is emerging from the camps, a development likely to intensify international condemnation of China's drastic efforts to control and indoctrinate a Muslim ethnic minority population of more than 12 million in Xinjiang.

Accounts from the region, satellite images and previously unreported official documents indicate that growing numbers of detainees are being sent to new factories, built inside or near the camps, where inmates have little choice but to accept jobs and follow orders.

""These people who are detained provide free or low-cost forced labor for these factories,"" said Mehmet Volkan Kasikci, a researcher in Turkey who has collected accounts of inmates in the factories by interviewing relatives who have left China. ""Stories continue to come to me,"" he said.

China has defied an international outcry against the sweeping internment program in Xinjiang, which holds Muslims and forces them to renounce religious piety and pledge loyalty to the party. The emerging labor program underlines the government's determination to continue operating the camps despite calls from United Nations human rights officials, the United States and other governments to close them.

The program aims to transform scattered Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities -- many of them farmers, shopkeepers and tradespeople -- into a disciplined, Chinese-speaking industrial workforce, loyal to the Communist Party and factory bosses, according to official plans published online.

These documents describe the camps as vocational training centers and do not specify whether inmates are required to accept assignments to factories or other jobs. But pervasive restrictions on the movement and employment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, as well as a government effort to persuade businesses to open factories around the camps, suggest that they have little choice.

Independent accounts from inmates who have worked in the factories are rare. Police block attempts to get near the camps and closely monitor foreign journalists who travel to Xinjiang, making it all but impossible to conduct interviews in the region. And most Uighurs who have fled Xinjiang did so before the factory program grew in recent months.

But Serikzhan Bilash, a founder of Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights, an organization in Kazakhstan that helps ethnic Kazakhs who have left neighboring Xinjiang, said he had interviewed relatives of 10 inmates in recent months who had told their families that they were made to work in factories after undergoing indoctrination in the camps.

They mostly made clothes, and they called their employers ""black factories,"" because of the low wages and tough conditions, he said.

Kasikci also described several cases based on interviews with family members: Sofiya Tolybaiqyzy, who was sent from a camp to work in a carpet factory; Abil Amantai, 37, who was put in a camp a year ago and told relatives he was working in a textile factory for $95 a month; Nural Razila, 25, who had studied oil drilling but after a year in a camp was sent to a new textile factory nearby.

""It's not as though they have a choice of whether they get to work in a factory, or what factory they are assigned to,"" said Darren Byler, a lecturer at the University of Washington who studies Xinjiang and visited the region in April.

He said it was safe to conclude that hundreds of thousands of detainees could be compelled to work in factories if the program were put in place at all of the region's internment camps.

The Xinjiang government did not respond to faxed questions about the factories, nor did the State Council Information Office, the central government agency that answers reporters' questions.

The documents detail plans for inmates, even those formally released from the camps, to take jobs at factories that work closely with the camps to continue to monitor and control them. The socks, suits, skirts and other goods made by these laborers would be sold in Chinese stores and could trickle into overseas markets.

Kashgar, an ancient, predominantly Uighur area of southern Xinjiang that is a focus of the program, reported that in 2018 alone it aimed to send 100,000 inmates who had been through the ""vocational training centers"" to work in factories, according to a plan issued in August.

That figure may be an ambitious political goal rather than a realistic target. But it suggests how many Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities may be held in the camps and sent to factories. Scholars have estimated that as many as 1 million people have been detained. The Chinese government has not issued or confirmed any figures.

""I don't see China yielding an inch on Xinjiang,"" said John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that lobbies China on human rights issues. ""Now it seems we have entrepreneurs coming in and taking advantage of the situation.""

The evolution of the Xinjiang camps echoes China's ""re-education through labor"" system, where citizens once were sent without trial to toil for years. China abolished ""re-education through labor"" five years ago, but Xinjiang appears to be creating a new version.

Retailers in the United States and other countries should guard against buying goods made by workers from the Xinjiang camps, which could violate laws banning imports produced by prison or forced labor, Kamm said.

While the bulk of clothes and other textile goods manufactured in Xinjiang ends up in domestic and Central Asian markets, some makes its way to the United States and Europe.

Badger Sportswear, a company based in North Carolina, last month received a container of polyester knitted T-shirts from Hetian Taida, a company in Xinjiang that was shown on a prime-time state television broadcast promoting the camps.

The program showed workers at a Hetian Taida plant, including a woman who was described as a former camp inmate. But the small factory did not appear to be on a camp site, and it is unclear whether it made the T-shirts sent to North Carolina.

Ginny Gasswint, a Badger Sportswear executive, said the company had ordered a small amount of products from Xinjiang, and used Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, a nonprofit certification organization, to ensure that its suppliers meet standards.

Seth Lennon, a spokesman for Worldwide, said that Hetian Taida had only recently enrolled in its program, and the organization had no information on possible coerced labor in Xinjiang. ""We will certainly look into this,"" he said.

Repeated calls over several days to Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, went unanswered.

Satellite imagery suggests that production lines are being built inside some internment camps.

Images of one camp featured in the state television broadcast, for example, show 10 to 12 large buildings with a single-story, one-room design commonly used for factories, said Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The buildings are surrounded by fencing and security towers, indicating that they are heavily guarded like the rest of the camp.

""It seems unlikely that any detainee would be able to go to any building that they were not taken to,"" Ruser said.

Commercial registration records also show at least a few companies have been established this year at addresses inside internment camps. They include a printing factory, a noodle factory and at least two clothing and textile manufacturers at camps in rural areas around Kashgar. Another clothing and bedding manufacturer is registered in a camp in Aksu in northwestern Xinjiang.

The government's effort to connect the internment camps with factories emerged this year as the number of detainees climbed and Xinjiang faced rising costs to build and run the camps.

Many camps were once called ""transformation through education centers"" by the government, reflecting their mission: inducing inmates to cast aside Islamic devotion and accept Communist Party supremacy.

But since August, the Chinese government has defended the camps by arguing that they are job training centers that will help lift detainees and their families out of poverty by giving them the skills to join China's economic mainstream. Many rural Uighurs speak little Chinese, and language training has been advertised as one of the main purposes of the camps.

Yet the practical training in the camps often appears to be rudimentary, said Adrian Zenz, a social scientist at the European School of Culture and Theology who has studied the campaign.

An early hint of the factory labor program came in March when Sun Ruizhe, president of the China National Textile and Apparel Council, described it to senior industry representatives, according to a transcript of his speech that was posted on industry websites.

Sun said that Xinjiang planned to recruit from three main sources to increase the textile and garment sector's workforce by more than 100,000 in 2018: impoverished households, struggling relatives of prisoners and detainees, and the camp inmates, whose training ""could be combined with developing the textile and apparel section.""

In April, the Xinjiang government began rolling out a plan to attract textile and garment companies. Local governments would receive funds to build production sites for them near the camps; companies would receive a subsidy of $260 to train each inmate they took on, as well other incentives.

In remarks in October defending the camps, a top official in Xinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, said the government was busy preparing ""job assignments"" for inmates formally finishing indoctrination and training. A budget document earlier this year from Yarkant, a county in Kashgar, said the camps were responsible for ""employment services.""

The inmates assigned to factories may have to stay for years.

Byler said a relative of a Uighur friend was sent to an indoctrination camp in March and formally released this fall. But he was then told he had to work for up to three years in a clothing factory.

A government official, Byler said, suggested to his friend's family that if the relative worked hard, his time in the factory might be reduced.

The Chinese state media has praised the centers as leading wayward people toward modern civilization. It also reports that the workers are generously paid.

""The training will turn them from 'nomads' into skilled marvels,"" the official Xinjiang Daily said last month. ""Education and training will make them into 'modern people,' useful to society."""

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

Parliament set for a stormy session on sixth straight day

Despite the first five days being a near washout, the commotion over Rafale row is unlikely to die down on the sixth day of Winter Session as Opposition and the government continue to spar over the issue outside Parliament. Reports say that Congress party is planning to hold 50 pressers in the coming days, while BJP ministers and leaders fanned out across the country Monday to allege Congress of spreading ""falsehood"" with an ""amazing audacity"" over the Rafale issue.

On Monday, the opposition party gave privilege notices against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government -- only to be countered with a notice against Rahul Gandhi by the ruling party MPs.

Parliament LIVE updates: Anand Sharma's comment reignited chaos in the House as members started noisily protesting. BJP leaders shouted down Sharma, while Congress members roared in support of the senior Congress leader's demand that BJP should withdraw its statement demanding apology from Rahul Gandhi. The Chairman then adjourned the House for the day, within four minutes of reconvening the Rajya Sabha.

The Rajya Sabha will resume at 2 pm. Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu requested to have a peaceful conduct of the house and allow issues to be discussed in the first few minutes of the session before it was adjourned.

Speaking outside the Parliament after the Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi took on the Narendra Modi government, saying the prime minister sat on farmers' loans for four years and didn't waive a single rupee. He asserted that this was injustice for the farmers. The Congress president highlighted that the party had already waived the loans of farmers in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh, two of the three states where the Congress came to power after the Assembly elections. Rahul demanded an answer from Modi on why he had not waived farmers' loans yet, when he could work for the benefit of big corporates.

The Lok Sabha session had resumed at noon amid shots of ""chowkidaar chor hai'. The ruckus continued even as Speaker Sumitra Mahajan tried to get the session underway. Mahajan appealed to MPs to allow the session to proceed, saying Parliament was a place for discussion. As her appeals fell on deaf ears, she adjourned the Lok Sabha for the day.

""The government is ready to discuss anything you want, but this is not the way. It is not giving a good message. We have to face the public. I'm requesting you again and again. Whatever discussions you want will be done as per the rules,"" she said. ""People abroad also ask what is happening in India?... We must show some responsibility. I'll request the government myself to hold a discussion. We must maintain a standard in Parliament.""

Earlier, the House was adjourned within minutes of convening amid slogans of ""Rahul Gandhi maafi mango"" and ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" shouted by BJP members. Congress MPs also countered with shouts of ""Modi sarkar chor hai"", when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 pm. Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid ruckus over the Rafale deal.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. Suresh Prabhu will introduce The National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to amend the National Institute of Design Act, 2014.

(AP) Barbed wire and hundreds of cameras ring a massive compound of more than 30 dormitories, schools, warehouses and workshops in China's far west. Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside. Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region where, by some estimates, 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately-owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S., Badger CEO John Anton said on Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

According to them, people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training. The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media on Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with first-hand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his month long detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating back to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collabourated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour. All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said on Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts. ""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uighurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push.

A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes. A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing.

Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign. If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

""The government is ready to discuss anything you want, but this is not the way. It is not giving a good message. We have to face the public. I'm requesting you again and again. Whatever discussions you want will be done as per the rules,"" she said. ""People abroad also ask what is happening in India?... We must show some responsibility. I'll request the government myself to hold a discussion. We must maintain a standard in Parliament.""

Earlier, the House was adjourned within minutes of convening amid slogans of ""Rahul Gandhi maafi mango"" and ""Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" shouted by BJP members. Congress MPs also countered with shouts of ""Modi sarkar chor hai"", when Speaker Sumitra Mahajan adjourned the House till 12 pm. Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till 2 pm amid ruckus over the Rafale deal.

BJP MPs Sanjay Jaiswal, Anurag Thakur and Nishikant Dubey have moved a privilege motion in the Lok Sabha against Congress president Rahul Gandhi on the Rafale controversy, seeking action against Rahul over his speech during the debate on the no-confidence motion against the Narendra Modi government in Parliament's Monsoon Session. Congress MP KC Venugopal, too, has moved a privilege motion against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, alleging that the government submitted misrepresented facts on the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court.

Meanwhile, the All India Trinamool Congress party has given a notice under Rule 267 in Rajya Sabha to take up discussion on the rising unemployment and lack of job opportunities, another thorny issue that the Opposition parties use to corner the government.

The Rafale row was expected to rock Parliament on the sixth straight day of the Winter Session even as the first week was a wash out over the controversy. The Congress party will move an Adjournment Motion for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) investigation into the deal.

Moreover, Left parties will seek a reply from the government on the questions raised against the Supreme Court verdict on the Rafale deal last Friday. The Congress and BJP, meanwhile, are locked in a battle of privilege motions, with the Congress giving a notice against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and the BJP responding with its own notice against Rahul Gandhi.

Monday, too, saw a stormy session in Parliament as the Lower House was adjourned for three times over Opposition protests relating to the Rafale issue. The Congress on Monday gave notices of breach of privilege in both Houses of Parliament, demanding an explanation from the Centre on why it provided the Supreme Court ""wrong"" information on the Rafale deal. Likewise, three members of the ruling party -- Anurag Thakur, Nishikant Dubey and Sanjay Jaiswal -- in the Lok Sabha too moved a notice of breach of privilege against the Congress president, alleging that he spoke ""falsehood"" and ""misled the House"" over the fighter aircraft deal in his speech during a debate in July.

The Lok Sabha was adjourned thrice since it met in the morning, before being adjourned for the day, as the treasury and the opposition benches sparred over the Rafale jet deal issue with both sides raising slogans against each other.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said it was unfortunate that the Opposition members were not allowing the Lok Sabha to function. The BJP workers and leaders also held protests in several parts of the country against the Congress party over the Rafale issue.

Other businesses listed for the day include a discussion on the increased frequency of natural calamities in coastal India and the Centre's preparedness in dealing with it. P Venugopal will raise a discussion on the natural calamities in various parts of the country, particularly in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, with special reference to cyclones Gaja, Titli, etc.

In legislative business, Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan is set to move the Consumer Protection Bill, 2018, in Lok Sabha to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers' disputes. Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad is likely to move for passage The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Bill, 2018. Suresh Prabhu will introduce The National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill, 2018 to amend the National Institute of Design Act, 2014.

When Adith AK packed his bags and left for Majuli, an island in the Brahmaputra river in Assam, in 2017, he did not imagine that he would end up staying there a whole year. ""My backpack had clothes to last me a week; I planned on staying only that long, just having a look around,"" he said.

But something there compelled him to stay put. Back in Chennai for a story recital for Tulika Books, he narrated the reason why.

Before moving to Majuli, Adith wore many hats: storyteller, performer, theatre artiste and dancer. After working with him on a dance video, his friend's friend introduced him to Bipin Dhane, founder of the Ayang trust that runs the Hummingbird School, in rural Majuli -- a primary school providing education to around 250 students.

""Bipin asked me to come and teach whatever I could there, but I did not want to take part in the academics. I wanted to teach kids through theatre or dance. Thankfully, Bipin agreed,"" he said. The Hummingbird, he added, gives tribal communities the relevant education. Books by education boards have lessons that they can't relate to, he said.

For his part, Adith works on teaching children movement. ""I work with teachers on their students' balance, proper hand-eye coordination, especially for younger children who are still working on their fine motor skills,"" he said.

He also trains them in teaching basic subjects through role play. ""For example, we were teaching a group of students about the digestive system. So we divided them into sections and had each of them play a different organ, in rotation. Or say, if you want to do simple addition or subtraction, you role-play as shopkeepers and customers. This helps with memory retention.""

Though he wanted to concentrate on theatre and dance, he also ended up taking charge of administrative work such as fund raising, building libraries and more. ""We collected bamboo and with the help of the locals, built a stage to hold plays,"" he said. He now works with 16 Government schools in the district. He helps teachers integrate theatre into teaching practices.

Life in Majuli, which became the first island to be made a district in India, in 2016, can be slow. The tribal communities form most of the population, and agriculture is the main source of economy. The area has pockets of forests.

Said Adith, ""I was scared I would get bored of the slow lifestyle there. But after a year there, I have realised how kind the people are, and how sustainable the lifestyle there is. I have so much more to learn, I am not coming back anytime soon."""

Muskan flung her quilt and clambered out of her bed. As she peeked through the half-open window to see what was going on, she fell on the ground and screamed, ""Mummy me kya gov"" (What happened to me, Mummy?).

On hearing the piercing shrieks of her daughter, 45-year-old Yasmeena Banu who was preparing morning tea, rushed to the room. Muskan was lying on the floor. She was bleeding profusely. A bullet had hit the right side of Muskan's head.

Muskan Succumbs to Her Injuries

Yasmeena grabbed her own hair in distress and hurriedly descended the stairs to inform her family. ""Muskan janas aaw fire (Muskan was hit by a bullet),"" Yasmeena screamed. Everyone in the family gathered and rushed Muskan to the district hospital in Anantnag, where doctors referred her to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) hospital, Srinagar.

Muskan was injured when there was an exchange of gunfire, only 600 metres from her home, between militants and government forces. According to eyewitnesses, the firing lasted for only 5 minutes.

""It all happened within minutes. We don't know who fired on whom,"" said Ghulam Nabi Wani, Muskan's father.

Inside the ambulance Muskan was repeatedly asking for water. Her injury was itching. She wanted to scratch it. ""The wound was hurting her. She also wanted to drink water, but doctors had given us precautions,"" said Yaseema. ""Near Pampore, before Muskan went into a coma, she murmured Kalima.""

Doctors at SMHS put Muskan on the ventilator. Her family members including Nabi and Yasmeena were wringing their hands in despair, pacing frantically across the hospital corridor. Muskan died within that night. The doctors informed the family the following day, that Muskan had succumbed to her injuries.

Life After Death

""We were praying the whole night. Nobody could get a wink of sleep. It was a painful night,"" said Nabi. ""We cried our hearts out. We had lost our only daughter. Like every parent, we had many dreams about her. They are all shattered now.""

When Muskan's remains reached her village, hundreds of mourners including her teachers and schoolmates were waiting to take part in her last rites.

Muskan was buried in a graveyard in front of her house. ""What could be more painful than this? Our daughter is close to us, but she is resting under mounds of mud and stone,"" said Nabi, pointing at her grave.

Apart from helping her mother with household work and maintaining the kitchen garden, Muskan was a bright student of Sir Syed Memorial School, Qaimoh. She had recently passed her Class 9 exams with a 57 percent.

Since Muskan's death, her classmates have become gloomy and despondent. They were missing their batchmate and loving friend. ""We used to sit, play and eat lunch together. Our Kashmir has become a difficult place to live. I sometimes feel in a class, that Muskan is sitting beside me,"" said Muskan's classmate, wishing to remain anonymous.

These days, Muskan's father Nabi is busy building a new house.

A Plea for Justice

After Muskan's death, the chairman of the International Forum for Justice and Human Rights (IFJHR), Muhammad Ahsan Untoo, and another human rights activist Zeenat Mushtaq, filed a petition with the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC), seeking a report on what led to the killing of Muskan.

On 3 December, in response to the joint petition, chairman of SHRC, Bilal Nazki issued a notice to the superintendent of police and deputy commissioner of Kulgam, to submit a detailed compliance report before the commission, regarding Muskan's killing.

""Nobody can expect justice in Kashmir, and we don't need any compensation from the government,"" said Nabi. ""For decades we have been losing our kids, and the State always replaces justice with compensation.""

Another Child's Death By the Gun

Around three kilometres away from Nabi's house in the same village, grief and anger still clutch the heart of 45-year-old Ali Mohammad Alai every time he thinks about 7 July 2018 when he lost his 12-year-old daughter Andleeb Ali. Andleeb was shot down by government forces near an alleyway, a few meters from her house. Besides Andleeb, the same day, two other young boys, namely Shakir Ahmad Khanday and Irshad Ahmad Lone were also killed. 21-year-old Shakir happened to be Andleeb's cousin.

The villagers said that, that day the government forces had entered Redwani village in the morning. The army vehicles had been pelted with stones near the government high school. The school officials had reported that, while chasing the protestors, the army had entered the school and grabbed a teacher's mobile phone, and picked up a Class 9 student who was attending a lecture.

More Deaths By the Gun

""Some outsiders pelted stones at the Army. They escaped through the school lawn,"" said a school official, on condition of anonymity. ""The Army dragged one of our students inhumanly."" When the villagers heard about the school incidents, they gathered and staged a protest near Anbleeb's house. As per eyewitnesses, the Army opened fire on protesters, and 22-year-old Irshad Ahmad Lone got seriously injured.

Andleeb's cousin Shakir, the family said, was walking home from a nearby graveyard. He tried to retrieve Irshad's body along with other villagers. The Army opened fire again, and this time Shakir was hit.

""As Andleeb has no brother, she was very close to Shakir. When we heard Shakir was lying on the road in a pool of blood, our female members went outside to pick him up,"" said Ali. ""Andleeb took a glass of water with her. When they reached the spot, the Army opened fire again. Bullets hit Andleeb on her right thigh.""

When Andleeb fell to the ground, she grabbed her 16-year-old sister Khusboo Jan's leg. ""Andleeb was bleeding profusely,"" said Khushboo.

After Andleeb's death, Khushboo has gone through intermittent bouts of depression and shock, having lost her dear friend and loving sister.

""Khushboo was most affected by Andleeb's killing. They were more friends than sisters. She is still in shock, and sometimes becomes unconscious when reminding of the scene,"" says Ali.

No Hope for Justice

On the same day as Andleeb's killing, the chairman of IFJHR, Muhammad Ahsan Untoo approached the SHRC to seek an investigation into the details of the killing of the minor. He filed the petition identified under SHRC /227Klgm/2018.

On 4 October, three months after Andleeb's killing, the Jammu and Kashmir Police, in response to a petition filed by Untoo, informed the SHRC that a ""16-year-old girl named Andleeb Jan was part of an unruly mob and the soldiers fired in self-defence"".

The police response also states that the concerned police station of the area received reliable information that a patrolling party of the Army was pelted with stones by an ""unruly mob"" who were carrying lathis (sticks), and they intended to kill the soldiers.

Like Nabi, Ali has no hope for justice. ""How could anyone expect justice from those who even mentioned the wrong age for my daughter? Andleeb was only 12,"" says Ali. ""I had already told everyone including police that my daughter was not a part of any unruly mob."" Ali has recently received a discharge certificate for Andleeb, and school officials have mentioned that she was born on 15 December 2006.

Holding On

Andleeb was a good student, and passed Class 6 from Government Middle School, Akbarabad, with 66.40 percent. ""Andleeb was an active girl. She used to take part in school quizzes and sports as well,"" said Zahoor Ahmad Malik, Andleeb's teacher. ""She was good in mathematics too.""

Since Andleeb's killing, Ali has kept the key to her cupboard with himself. He has kept Andleeb's clothes, books and schoolbag inside it.

Nabi, late Muskan's father, hopes to decorate his daughter's grave a bit more, while Ali visits Andleeb's grave every day, to pray for her soul.

The post angered many students, who said the university did not know about the event at all before Monday.

Many students said they waited outside the event site for over an hour.

""It is obviously the organiser's fault for not applying to the school to use an on-campus building,"" net user Swim Xinzhu, a student from GUFE, said.

""We have held similar events before and there would be no issue if the organiser had reported in advance,"" an employee of the varsity said.

The organiser's deputy manager, a Beijing-based film-promoting company, reposted the Weibo post by Khan's film account, saying they were contacting the film crew and the school to figure out what caused the poor communication.

The fan meet was soon relocated to a Four Seasons hotel not far from the campus and ended at around 11 p.m. on Monday night."

Schools in Nagapattinam district that functioned as relief camps for a few weeks after Cyclone Gaja continue to provide refuge to the affected people at night.

Classes are conducted as usual during the day in schools in Vizhundamavadi, Vettaikaraniruppu, Kovilpathu, Vellapallam and Pushpavanam dotting the coastal stretch between Nagapattinam and Vedaranyam.

After the school hours, displaced residents occupy the classrooms.

The start of relief camps, most of them in schools and other educational institutions, in Nagapattinam and other coastal districts well before the cyclone made its landfall, saved scores of lives.

In Nagapattinam district alone, 77,319 families comprising 1,09,480 men, 1,29,924 women, and 46,063 children were accommodated in 415 camps.

The Nagapattinam district administration declared holidays for schools that housed displaced people in large numbers.

But, subsequently, authorities prevailed upon the displaced people to render their cooperation for smooth conduct of the schools during the day time. There was a compulsion for the Education department to complete the stipulated number of working days in an academic year.

Initially, there was misconception among the displaced people that only those who remained in relief camps would get benefits announced by the State government. They were convinced after repeated assurances by government officials that their fears were misplaced, a senior official of School Education Department said. Fortunately, they also realised their responsibility towards the student community. In most of the camps, children's families were the ones who were displaced, the official said.

Their presence was not felt since the building infrastructure was much more in proportion to pupil strength. The district administration took care of the daily water and food requirements of the people living in the camps, he explained.

The Education department was conscious of the reality that the displaced people could not be sent home at least for one more month. Restoration of electricity in interior parts of the district, vital requirement for the people to resume their normal lives, was still in progress, the official added."

In the beginning it was all about getting classrooms to fill up but now the focus is on getting quality students. How do you plan to get students to pick AUD as their first choice?

The founders of a new university had quite a challenge, especially when you are trying to carve out a niche for yourself among already established social science giants in the Capital. Fair amount of work went into building the character of the university that it is known for today. As they say, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. It did take some time for us to build a reputation but word of mouth helped and we did not do any large-scale publicity. It helps that being a State-funded university, 85% of seats are reserved for students whose domicile of origin is Delhi.

The variety we offer in some of the foundation courses and electives offer a good value to students that gives them a larger world view and options. School education does not make you think all that much, so we expose students to various future opportunities. Students mature better and understand the world better after studying a variety of courses. It is the very essence of education at AUD. Close interaction with faculty since we have small numbers also helps with better outcomes.

It is not only about providing students with a set of skills but also about inculcating in students a set of ethics, beliefs and values via interaction with students and faculty from other programmes. We believe that our courses will give students a better perspective unlike in other training centres, where it is all about learning a skill. Being a vocational course, students being job ready is important and we have a 100% paid internship record. Our first batch will finish in 2019 and we hope the efforts that our faculty put into building a large network and tie-ups will pay off.

We also have a new programme, Early Childhood Education and Development, which is a first and looks to fill a void in the society, as there are a large number of working parents and there is a need of preschool education. It is a course where we would like to encourage enterprises so students go out and start their own preschools.

Institutions cannot be top-down. One of the conscious decisions taken in the early years of AUD was that we are going to be a university which is self-governed. This essentially means that we stick to a certain set of values, processes and systems, and that must be something that is non-negotiable and owned by everybody. The very working of the university must be a collective responsibility where everybody knows that if we let these values slip, it has its own implications. It is a belief that percolates down to the faculty and is something that is nurtured, cherished and has a continuity that no single V-C or any other leader destroy. Having said that, we must be mindful as we grow and take everybody aboard.

The students' union election was conducted as per the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations. We believe that protests and speaking your mind are a very important part of a social science university, which shows maturing of the mind and an individual, and collective growth of a student. We want informed, engaged and responsible students in the country and social science universities have a huge role to play in that.

We have worked out a seven-year plan in which we need to do both -- consolidate as well as expand.

At the moment, the space we have is limited. By 2019 or the year after that, we will be saturated in terms of the number of students, so that will be a limitation.

Simultaneously, we are exploring campus development projects in two locations -- Dheerpur and Rohini.

There are many schools at AUD that are looking to expand. Especially in schools which have masters' programmes, we are looking to introduce bachelors' programmes. We will have to see how to strategically manage the expansion given our limitations.

We will have about 15,000 students by 2023-24. We are also looking at community programmes and programmes that are online as well as in person which will help build numbers.

At the moment, no. We must acknowledge the seriousness and value that the AAP government has given to education. They have done a great job dealing with school education and have already started initiatives on higher education and the institute they are funding.

Having said that, eventually the future of education in the country, as things stand, will require institutions in some measure to generate their own resources.

Whether or not the government is asking us to do that, we are mindful of it and will have to look at possible avenues."

The students were rushed to Yatharth Hospital in Sector 110 and Prayag Hospital in Sector 41.

""We have also seized the earth-moving machine,"" said Mr. Pandey, adding that a case has been lodged against the school's owner, principal and three others."

The Harvard Business Review's latest ranking of top 100 CEOs includes only 32 MBAs. Since its inception, the proportion of MBAs in this exclusive club has hovered around 30. No wonder, questions are being increasingly raised about the relevance of conventional management education, especially mainstream MBA programmes. Against this background, business schools will do well to pay attention to the work of this year's Nobel laureate Paul Romer, who, incidentally, is a professor at a leading business school. His work in economics highlights the role of ideas and innovation in economic growth. Innovation need not be only technological, but it also spans domains of international trade, public policy and business management. Research and development are keys to innovation.

Of late, leading management institutes in India have increased their focus on research. However, research publications that help institutes to rise in academic rankings do not necessarily make them relevant to practice. Noted management scholar Nirmalya Kumar made a stinging observation about doctoral programmes arguing that, with a few exceptions, most marketing academics did not focus on the issues important to practitioners.

While research is aimed at understanding a phenomenon, development deals with creation. But businesses are seldom contended with mere understanding of phenomenon. They aspire to find solutions to problems. This is often the root cause of the perceived gap between theory and practice of management. If this gulf is to be bridged, business schools will have to shift focus from mere 'research' to 'research and development'. In science and technology domain, the term 'development' is commonly used in conjunction with research. However, the same is rare in business management, at least in academia.

Research does contribute towards solution building, but it is not the only input for the same. Development often calls for imagination and creativity. For instance, study of profile & behaviour of the Bottom of the Pyramid (BOP) consumers constitutes research. But development of marketing strategy comprising low unit packs in the form of one-rupee shampoo sachets for BOP segment or pay-per-use pricing policy for usage of tractors by small landowner farmers has been a result of ingenuity of entrepreneurs and managers. Management guru CK Prahalad, who brought light on BOP markets, spoke about limitations of 'best practices' and the need to concentrate on 'next practices'. While a researcher can study best practices as they exist, next practices come under the realm of development.

If universities and business schools wish to focus on research and development, they need to raise some fundamental questions related to their research approaches and doctoral programmes. A fundamental difference between natural and social sciences often gets overlooked. In natural sciences, the 'reality' that is being investigated and the research findings that are supposed to facilitate understanding of the 'reality' can be independent of each other. Noted management scholar Sumantra Ghoshal illustrated this very lucidly with an example. He argued that even if a researcher wrongly interprets that the Sun revolves around the Earth and not the other way round, the reality does not change. The existence of objective reality makes it relatively easy for natural scientists to critically assess the evidence. However, in social sciences, the reality can be socially constructed.

Let us take the case of a company trying to expand market for electric cars. Using tools and techniques borrowed from natural sciences, a management researcher can build evidence about how and at what rate the market for petrol and diesel engine driven cars grew. Manufacturers of electric cars can certainly draw a few lessons from this. But these very same methods may not be useful to garner evidence on how electric car market 'can' be grown because the phenomenon of market expansion is yet to unfold. On the other hand, when an engineer tries to develop the first electric car, he/she can develop it in a lab, test it and provide evidence so that the same can be used prospectively. In most managerial situations, 'reality' cannot be constructed in advance of the practice. Since it is difficult to create managerial situations in labs, research techniques that rely on pattern recognition statistically can normally be used only retrospectively.

Moreover, innovation, by definition, amounts to breaking free from the pattern. A formula that led to the success of one organisation at one point of time can be intentionally disrupted by managers in competing organisations. Gary Hamel and CK Prahalad, in their best seller 'Competing for the Future', cite examples from photocopying and earthmoving equipment industry, wherein smaller players like Canon and Komatsu intentionally adopted practices that were very different from their respective leading competitors -- Xerox and Caterpillar. While researchers try to understand rules of the game, innovation results from changing those very rules.

If business schools want to retain relevance, they will have to make systematic efforts at according academic legitimacy to 'developmental' work of scholars. IIT Delhi has taken a step in this direction. It has decided to help doctoral scholars in converting their theses into ventures. Business schools need to remind themselves that the likes of Peter Drucker, Henry Mintzberg, Michael Porter, CK Prahalad, Sumantra Ghoshal or W Chan Kim attained status of revered gurus not because their researches involved esoteric tools and techniques, but because their work extended beyond research and led to the development of innovative solutions to managerial problems."

An employee of the DM Higher Secondary School in Tirukovilur, an aided institution, was booked and arrested by the police under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) for sexually assaulting a girl studying in Class X of the school.

The name of the accused was given as Albert Soundarrajan, working as a school assistant and hailing from Cuddalore district.

He has been remanded in custody. The police said the victim was an inmate of the school hostel.

When she did not return to the hostel after school hours, the hostel warden and headmaster Jubilee Devasena searched for her and found her unconscious near an overhead water tank on the terrace of the school.

The crime came to light after the victim narrated her ordeal to the hostel authorities.

The police said the victim went to drink water in the school building when the accused slapped her and she became unconscious. The accused carried her to the terrace and sexually assaulted her.

Based on a complaint lodged by the headmaster, the police booked Soundarrajan under Section 4 of POCSO Act.

In another case, the Tirukovilur All Women Police on Monday arrested two persons for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl.

The police said the victim was playing near her house when Boominathan, 24, and Kaaman, 31, forcibly took her and raped her.

The police said Kaaman was married with two children while Boominathan's marriage was fixed next month.

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

Two children were killed and three injured after a wall of a school building collapsed here Monday, prompting Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to order a magisterial-level probe, even as the police booked six people in this connection, officials said.

The wall of the private primary school collapsed on the children at around 9.30 am allegedly due to the impact of some construction activity, involving use of a heavy machine (JCB), in the adjoining plot in Salarpur village, the police said.

""The children were rushed to a hospital for treatment where two were declared dead, while three others undergoing treatment,"" the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Gautam Buddh Nagar, Ajay Pal Sharma, said.

The deceased were identified as Bhupendra Singh, 10, and Vivek, 7, the police said.

Six people, including KM Public School's principal Sanjeev Jha, its manager Raghvendra Solanki, owner Amit Bhati, his relative Deshraj Bhati and Sumit Bhati (Deshraj's son) and an unidentified JCB operator have been booked in this connection, they said.

They have been charged under Indian Penal Code sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 338 (causing grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others), among others, the police said.

The deceased's parents briefly disrupted the traffic on the Dadri-Noida road this evening near the village, demanding compensation.

The DM, who along with SSP Sharma, had visited the hospital and met with the victims and their families, said a magisterial-level probe has been ordered into the incident.

The chief minister has asked the DM to submit a report within a week.

""We will send a preliminary report also to the government and other details would also emerge soon,"" he told PTI.

Singh said the district administration was also looking into the demand of the families seeking compensation. ""Their demands are under consideration,"" he said.

According to the FIR, the school building was ""too old and deteriorated"".

""The construction work in the plot adjoining the school was being done without any official approval from the authorities concerned,"" it stated.

At Ambit, we spend a lot of time reading articles that cover a wide gamut of topics, ranging from zeitgeist to futuristic, and encapsulate them in our weekly 'Ten Interesting Things' product. Some of the most fascinating topics covered this week are Management (Rocker's guide to management), MedTech (Using AI in diagnosing Cancer), Behaviour (National character stereotypes mirror language use), Technology (Robots controlled by paralysed people), Environment (Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment?) and Politics (When presidents were people) among others.

Here are the ten most interesting pieces that we read this week, ended December 14, 2018.

1) A rocker's guide to management [Source: 1843magazine.com]

Some interesting management lessons can be taken from the historic rock bands the world has seen. And this piece throws light on how some of the most famous bands in the world have managed to stick together over the years, while others broke apart. So, what's the most important thing? Finding the right combination of personalities pays off. As an investor, Garry Tan, co-founder of Posterous and Posthaven, says he probes the relationship between a start-up's founders as much as he does its business model. For him, the relationship needs to be deeper than the project.

Talking about Coldplay, they have been together for so many years. Why? Because they have a shared vision of success. All the band members get an equal cut even though Chris Martin is the lead. This democratic model depends on individual members believing that each has the group's interest at heart, not just their own. Coldplay knew they wanted to be the biggest band in the world; each member had the same clear-eyed ambition. Their equal income split works like equity shares: every partner has a direct interest in keeping the band together.

Marie-Louise von Franz, a psychoanalyst, wrote that ""whenever one is in a group...one has to draw a veil over a part of one's personality."" Gains from collaboration are traded off against self-expression. Occasionally, she said, it's the other way around: a group can become united in spirit and each individual expresses themselves more fully than they would be able to by themselves. A ""superpersonal harmony"" prevails. This rare condition, says von Franz, is what lies behind myths such as the Knights of King Arthur.

2) Powerful Predictors: Diagnosing Cancer in India using AI [Source: digital.hbs.edu]

In India, less than 10,000 pathologists have to service a population of 1.3 billion people. While the number of pathologists are too less, approximately 74,000 women die from cervical cancer every year, accounting for one-third of the burden of cervical cancer deaths globally. To take on this challenge, a company is using artificial intelligence (AI) to detect cervical cancer. The company here is Aindra Systems, founded by Adarsh Natarajan. Aindra is demonstrating how strategic use of automated technologies has the potential to democratize access to quality care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Aindra's end-to-end diagnostic platform takes biological samples which are stained by an autostainer, converted into a digital image, and then analyzed by AI algorithms to differentiate between cancerous cells and healthy cells. This three-part process is done onsite at a clinic, eliminating the need for the tedious process of manual staining and the transport of large batches of samples to distant laboratories. As a result, patients are told if they have cancerous lesions within 1-2 hours instead of 5-6 weeks.

Aindra's platform makes a strong case for the use of AI to address global health challenges, but AI-assisted technologies require vast amounts of labeled, high-quality data to train the AI algorithm, data that doesn't exist in many low-resource environments. In the case of healthcare, poor quality data could lead to fatal outcomes. AI-powered cervical cancer detection, in combination with widespread human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination, has the potential to prevent deaths from cervical cancer globally -- an historic achievement. Companies like Aindra could play a key role in reducing the burden of disease in populations with poor access to high quality care and set the stage for future entrepreneurs from LMICs to develop AI-assisted technologies using human-centered design.

3) What's next for marketplace start-ups [Source: andrewchen.co]

In this essay, Andrew Chen, general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, talks about the future of marketplaces. This essay covers: 1) why services are still offline; 2) the history of service marketplace paradigms which include the listings era, the unbundled Craigslist era, the ""Uber for X"" era, and the managed marketplace era; 3) the future of service marketplaces; and 4) the future opportunities.

Over the years, the buying habits have changed. From physical stores to online, people have started shopping online. These ecommerce shopping portals account for trillions of dollars in market capitalization. The next era will do the same to the $9.7 trillion US consumer service economy, through discontinuous innovations in AI and automation, new marketplace paradigms, and overcoming regulatory capture.

In the next 20 years, there'll be immense opportunities where technological, operational and regulatory hurdles persist. The services sector represents two-thirds of US consumer spending and employs 80% of the workforce. The companies that reinvent various service categories can improve both consumers' and professionals' lives-by creating more jobs and income, providing more flexible work arrangements, and improving consumer access and lowering cost.

4) In conversation with...Françoise Barré-Sinoussi [Source: mosaicscience]

In this conversation, Françoise Barré-Sinoussi reveals how she identified HIV as the cause of AIDS, and also talks about her receipt of the Nobel Prize, and the latest efforts to prevent, treat and manage HIV. When Françoise Barré-Sinoussi, along with her colleague Luc Montagnier, found the virus that causes the disease, it proved monumental, a boulder thrown into a lake whose ripples still fan out today. It proved critical too, transforming our understanding of AIDS as it bulldozed through country after country, bringing blindness and pneumonia and death like a grim huckster.

Effective treatment might have been developed in 1996, but three things prevented Barré-Sinoussi from giving up her fight against the disease: the lack of availability of antiretrovirals - of today's 35 million sufferers, only about a third receive treatment; the limitations of the treatment, which can cause a kaleidoscope of side effects; and the galloping rise in the number of infections. Barré-Sinoussi is ""concerned"" about young people, who are ""too relaxed"" about HIV because ""the education campaigns are not sufficient...there is not enough information"". A 2013 survey in Scotland found one in ten pupils think HIV can be transmitted through kissing.

Since 2008, when the first known case of an HIV patient being 'cured' was reported, dubbed the 'Berlin patient', a growing wave of stories have appeared citing research from around the world on what could lead to a cure. But scientists largely prefer the term 'functional cure' (Barré-Sinoussi favours 'remission' or 'sustained remission'), using it to describe a scenario in which a sufferer no longer needs antiretroviral therapy (ART) but his or her body is not wholly free from HIV. When asked whether functional cure will be available, she says, ""Maybe we will have a treatment that will be effective not for all but for some."" Also, on getting a complete cure, she says even she is doesn't know when that will happen.

5) National character stereotypes mirror language use: A study of Canadian and American tweets [Source: journals.plos.org]

Stereotypes about national character, i.e., individually held beliefs regarding psychological traits of world nations and cultures, are ubiquitous, stable and influential. The importance of these beliefs for the functioning of individuals, groups and societies is hard to overestimate. National character stereotypes, or beliefs about the personality characteristics of the members of a nation, present a paradox. Such stereotypes have been argued to not be grounded in the actual personality traits of members of nations, yet they are also prolific and reliable.

Stereotypes of Canadians and Americans exemplify the paradox; people in both nations strongly believe that the personality profiles of typical Canadians and Americans diverge, yet aggregated self-reports of personality profiles of Canadians and Americans show no reliable differences. The linguistic behaviour of nations mirrors national character stereotypes. A study conducted by using 40 million tweets from the microblogging platform Twitter quantified the words and emojis diagnostic of Canadians and Americans. Another study explored the positivity of national language use.

In other studies, the 120 most nationally diagnostic words and emojis of each nation are presented to naive participants. They are then asked to assess personality of a hypothetical person who uses either diagnostically Canadian or American words and emojis. Personality profiles derived from the diagnostic words of each nation bear close resemblance to national character stereotypes.

6) Why are Indian managers so damn good? [Source: qz.com]

The co-authors of Made-in-India Managers, R Gopalakrishnan and Ranjan Banerjee, discuss why some of the Indian-born global corporate leaders are successful. Leaders like Satya Nadella (Microsoft), Indra Nooyi (formerly PepsiCo), Sundar Pichai (Google), Shantanu Narayen (Adobe), and Nitin Nohria (Harvard Business School) have had a significant component of their early upbringing, living experiences, and education in India. According to the authors, they are ""made-in-India managers.""

After studying these leaders and others who were in leadership positions in global organisations across the world, the authors got an answer to their question; How did being 'made-in-India' help you get where you are today? The experience of growing up in India had shaped them positively in fundamental ways. There were basically four features that made them stand apart.

Competitive intensity: the authors conducted informal focus group to understand their perceptions of management education in India. One of the consistent themes that emerged through the interviews was their perception of Indian students as industrious and diligent. India's foremost business school, IIM Ahmedabad, admits one student for every 400 applications. Diversity and inclusion: This comes to save them when adjusting to a different or a variety of cultural environments. Such exposure begins early in life. It is not unusual in school to share lunch with people from different states -- a vast variety of cuisine is shared, understood, and appreciated.

Dealing with ambiguity: Indians learn to deal with a lot of things that are uncertain, and develop the ability to quickly assess situations and help themselves without waiting for the system to help them. Family values: The percentage of India-made leaders citing a family member as an influential role model is significantly higher than for their Western counterparts. The formative role of the family in shaping values through demonstration, stressing the value of education, and proving an ""always there"" support provides a strong value core that builds resilience. The strengths of the made-in-India manager emerge from the coming together of multiple, interlinked features with the ability to ""think in English.""

7) Cafe opens in Tokyo staffed by robots controlled by paralysed people [Source: soranews24.com]

Who said robots and humans can't live together? On 26 November, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held in the Nippon Foundation Building in Akasaka, Tokyo for a very special kind of cafe. Called Dawn ver.β, this café is staffed entirely with robot waiters. So what's new? Most of the places have robots. While this café's waiters' are robots, these robots are controlled by paralysed people.

Developed by Ory, a start-up that specializes in robotics for disabled people, the OriHime-D is a 120cm (4-foot) tall robot that can be operated remotely from a paralysed person's home. Even if the operator only has control of their eyes, they can command OriHime-D to move, look around, speak with people, and handle objects. Created in collaboration between Ory, NPO Nippon Foundation, and airline ANA, Dawn ver.β is designed to resemble the titular cafe from the 2008 anime Time of Eve, which is also contributing to the project.

During this time a staff of ten people, with conditions such as ALS or spinal cord injuries and working from home, are paid 1,000 yen (US$8.80) an hour (a standard wage for part-time work in Japan) to serve up coffee and interact with the clientele. But more importantly than money, these people are also given a newfound independence. In an age where people are afraid of robots taking all the jobs, it's nice to see an instance of robots giving people jobs for a change, especially in such a meaningful way.

8) Plasticphobia: Will going plastic-free harm the environment? [Source: BBC Radio ]

In this podcast, Tom Heaps, Rural Affairs Correspondent of BBC News, and a United Kingdom television and radio reporter and presenter, talks to several experts on plastic and its effects on our lives. The idea of plastic saving nature feels like environmental blasphemy today with its near universal polluting presence. We are all encouraged to live plastic-free, but does this put the interest of the planet first? Or are we at danger of damaging environmental side effects?

Most of the things that we use in our daily lives are made out of plastic. Be it spoon, bottles, earphones, mobiles, kitchen accessories, office accessories, etc. In UK alone, there are around 13bn plastic bottles used for water and soft drinks. Also, we are irresponsible in disposing these plastics. It's said that by 2020 all our plastic would be home compostable. Susan Lambert, curator of the Arts University, Bournemouth, feels that plastics are water-saving, land-sparing, etc. Tom Heaps also visited a plant where the company made plastics from plants. CEO of Biome Technologies, Paul Mines, says that they use plants to make bioplastics. And these bioplastics are used in making plastic materials like cups, bags, etc.

But one question that needs an answer is whether it is harmful for the environment? As these are made from plants, wouldn't it harm the nature? Mr. Mines says that these bioplastics are compostable within 3 months compared to years that it takes for a normal plastic bottle. While compostable plastic is one option, the other one is recycling. Steve Mahon from Armstrong Energy feels that we can turn all the plastics that are burnt or dumped into oil again. Armstrong Energy is making oils from plastics. So they are taking it back to its original form.

9) 'An education arms race': Inside the ultra-competitive world of private tutoring [Source: the Guardian] Every parent wants their offspring to be a master at whatever they plan to do in their careers. And to make that possible, they'll work day and night so that they can afford the best education for their kids. You can gauge this by the number of students being dropped at the Explore Learning tuition centre for extra maths and English coaching. The Bradford branch of Explore Learning is a tiny window into Britain's booming private tuition sector, now worth an estimated £2bn. Founded in 2001 by Bill Mills, a Cambridge maths graduate, the business now has 139 centres around the country (plus five in Texas run by a sister company). They are located mainly in shopping centres, so busy parents can get on with their weekly shop while their offspring perfect their times tables, punctuation and grammar.

The families who use the centre come from various walks of life. Some parents have their own businesses; others work at Bradford Royal Infirmary. There are families from Latvia, Poland and the Philippines. The parents talk about giving their children ""an edge"", the ""leg up"" they never had. Geoff Clayton, a retired garage worker, has been bringing his 10-year-old grandson, Brooklyn, to Explore Learning for about nine months. Brooklyn lives with his grandparents and likes football, Minecraft and maths. ""He's done really well,"" says Clayton. ""His reading has got a lot better, everything's got better."" The membership takes a significant chunk out of his pension, but he is happy to pay it to give Brooklyn ""a bit of a leg up"".

Initiatives aimed at making tuition more accessible already exist: some agencies pledge a proportion of their tuition to poorer pupils for free, while non-profit programmes such as the Tutor Trust connect tutors with disadvantaged schools. Explore Learning offers ""scholarships"" that give a 50% discount to parents on income support or jobseeker's allowance.

Some parents buy extra tuition to support children with special educational needs such as dyslexia, which mainstream schools are increasingly unable to meet. One mother from Nigeria said she sought extra support for her child as a practical response to racial discrimination: ""Any child from a minority has to be many times better than their white counterparts to be able to get into the top schools and universities."" But, not everyone is positive about the impact of tuition. ""It can cause students to not work in lessons,"" said one teacher. Another said: ""The need for tutoring frightens me. Schools should be able to offer students the support they need in class sizes that are manageable.""

10) When presidents were people [Source: the Atlantic ]

In this digital age, people are so exposed to fake news that they fail to differentiate between what's real and what's fake. This article, and Richard Ben Cramer's book 'What it Takes', shows how the era of politicians like George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump have seen dramatic change. Mr. Bush showed himself to people and was human-like, emoting genuine feelings. He didn't shield stuff that made him human from the people who covered him.

More so in those times a person's word mattered (since people were overall less about faking it). The spurts of doubt didn't matter, Mr. Cramer writes: Nixon had told Bush, to his face, that he was innocent, and for Bush, that was that. ""That was what he had to give, that was the measure of loyalty -- and the requirement of the code: personal commitment,"" Cramer writes. But, today's fast-paced life, era of reading headlines and low ""real"" interactions have made us judge, jury and executioner quick to write off things/people at a moment's notice.

In the Donald Trump era, where cries of ""fake news"" abound and the president views the media as the enemy, it's hard to imagine a resurgence of such access to politicians as people. A politician today is much more robotic, hence becoming less empathetic and way more rehearsed (can be read as fake) and everyone (not just politicians) is moving towards this. This is now becoming innate and something like-lie about your feeling and actions enough and that might just become the new normal or acceptable feeling (less human perhaps)."

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has approved a financial cost of Rs 2,242.03 crore during 2018-19 and 2019-20 for rolling out the revamped scheme, an official statement said.

The CCEA has further approved constitution of an autonomous society under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs similar to Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti to run the Eklavya Model Residential Schools (EMRSs) and upgradation of the already sanctioned EMRSs on need basis with unit cost subject to a maximum of Rs 5 crore per school.

It also approved setting up sports facilities in 163 tribal-dominated districts at a unit cost of Rs 5 crore each by the year 2022.

""A total of 102 such blocks are already having EMRSs. Thus, 462 new EMRSs will be established in these blocks across the country. The new scheme envisages increase in construction cost of EMRSs from the current Rs 12 crore to Rs 20 crore to improve the construction quality and ensure better facilities for the students.

""The recurring cost will be enhanced to Rs 1,09,000 per student per year from the existing Rs 61,500 per student per year from 2019-20 onwards,"" the statement stated.

An additional 20 per cent cost would be provided towards construction cost in North East, hilly areas and areas affected by Left Wing Extremism.

EMRS is an excellent approach for imparting quality education to Scheduled Tribes (ST) children. Apart from school building, including hostels and staff quarters, playgrounds, computer labs and teacher resource rooms are also included in the scheme. This initiative will benefit ST students immensely, the statement said.

By focusing on specific intervention to cater to the educational needs of STs, their quality of life is expected to improve to the level of the rest of the social groups and a visible impact by the 2021 Census, it added."

One of the Indian-Americans to win the schorlaship is Shomik Verma from the Houston Area. Verma went to school in Fort Bend ISD and graduated from Clements High School in Sugar Land in 2015. Currently he is a senior studying mechanical engineering at Duke University's Pratt School of Engineering and has been named one of this year's 48 recipients chosen for the prestigious Marshall Scholarship.

Verma was chosen from among more than 1,000 applicants throughout the country and is the 29th Marshall recipient from Duke. He is the fifth Duke engineering student to earn the honor, and the first since 2011. Duke University President Vincent E. Price congratulated Shomik on behalf of the entire university community and mentioned that Shomik has contributed not only in the classroom and lab but also through public service, cultural engagement and residential leadership.

""Shomik stands out among our student organizations' leadership as being one of the most responsible, involved and passionate leaders that I have seen in over a decade with dozens of student groups each year,"" said Linda Franzoni, associate dean for undergraduate education at the Pratt School of Engineering.

Verma has also been selected for a Goldwater Scholarship and a Udall Scholarship earlier this year. Pratt faculty has chosen Verma to be both a Grand Challenge Scholar and a Pratt Fellow, honors that offer extensive lab experience. He was also elected to Tau Beta Pi and serves as co-president of Pi Tau Sigma.

Verma has pursued research in building a hydrogen fuel cell car and leading a Duke student team to a Guinness World Record for the most fuel-efficient human-carrying prototype vehicle ever built. Verma is also president of the Duke Energy Club, through which he has worked with Duke's Energy Initiative to create three new assistantships for students to do energy research with faculty, and is co-president of the Duke Smart Home, a living-learning community where residents live in a LEED platinum building and work on technological solutions to sustainability issues.

Skilled in playing an Indian classical drum called the tabla, Verma has worked to increase the visibility of Duke's South Asian music group, Sangeet, on campus. This effort led to their first-ever performance in Duke Chapel during a Diwali service in fall of 2017.

""At Duke, I've had the wonderful opportunity to 'live the science' through various hands-on experiences,"" said Verma. ""Whether it's living at the Smart Home, installing solar panels or building high-efficiency vehicles, I've seen first-hand the benefits novel energy technologies can have on the environment and human health. Seeing these real-world applications motivates me to pursue a research career to develop innovative solutions to energy challenges.""

Fascinated by the potential of renewable energy technologies to radically reduce human impact on the environment, Verma will join the lab of Dr. Rachel Evans at Cambridge University to pursue his near-term objective of developing novel materials that increase the efficiency of solar photovoltaic cells.

""When I first received the call that I was selected as a Marshall Scholar, I was in utter disbelief,"" Verma said. ""I had to check my phone's call history several times to make sure I didn't dream the whole thing! I'm so thankful for the support of my family, friends and advisors, and I'm beyond excited to spend the next two years in the UK working on developing the next generation of solar technology.""

Marshall Scholarships were established in 1953 by the British government to honor the ideals of the Marshall Plan and the special US/UK relationship."

The story of Mohan Bhargava leaving his life and high paying job behind in the U.S, to help a village in India showed how one man could truly affect thousands of lives. The will to get up and do something for someone is all that one needs.

Swades wasn't just a figment of Gowariker's imagination, but based on the lives of NRI couple Aravinda Pillalamarri and Ravi Kuchimanchi. Theirs is an incredible story of return to India, and giving back to society, a story of inconceivable will to carry out their vision.

Ravi has always been deeply rooted in grassroots development in India. He founded the AID (Association for Indian Development) back in 1991 while working for his PhD in Physics at the University of Maryland, USA. To tell you a little about his initiative, AID is a secular charity organisation based in the United States that works towards promoting ""sustainable, equitable and just development"". Over the years, AID, with the work they have carried out in India, has won a number of accolades including the 'Global Impact Award' by Times of India. Currently, AID has more than 36 chapters with over a 1000 volunteers spread across the globe.

Aravinda was brought up in the U.S, and has been working with AID since 1995. It is reported that it was at AID that Ravi and Aravinda met, and started working together towards a better India. She has been working on a number of projects with the organisation since, including advocating a model of participatory development where social justice was looked at as the heart of any developmental work. Upon the completion of her Master's degree in South Asian Studies at the University of Wisconsin, Ravi and Arvinda moved to India to work full-time on several AID projects. The year was 1998.

Bilgaon is this remote town in Maharashtra located on Udai, a tributary of river Narmada. Scattered across a four kilometre radius, it is a quaint little town with 180 tribal families. For 55 years after Independence, Bilgaon had not seen electricity. The national electricity grid would be 12 kms away from the village. Even the power line from India's mega hydel project being built on the Narmada river, the Sardar Sarovar Dam, avoided the tribal villages. The nearest proper road would be 60 kms away, and a makeshift, muddy, 'kachchi sadak' - 18 kilometers away. Everything that could be wrong with Bilgaon was wrong with Bilgaon.

What Aravinda and Ravi did notice was a 9-metre high waterfall of sorts which could very well have been utilised to generate electricity. The Bilgaon Project started in May 2002. It took some time, but eventually, by January 2003, they had done it. Thanks to a tiny 15KW generator, The Bilgaon Project provided electricity to each and every home in the village. They were also successful in building an 'ashramshala', a boarding school that provided shelter and necessary education to approximately 300-odd children from Bilgaon and surrounding villages. It was absolutely outstanding to be able to create a sustainable form of energy for a generation of people who didn't even know what electricity was.

They weren't the only two involved in this, obviously. It was collaboration at its best in fact. Anil Kumar and C G Madhusoodanan from People's School of Energy (PSE) in Kerala, prepared the blueprints. The special turbine was designed by a professor from IISc, Bangalore, the implementation was done by Mumbai-based Sarvodaya Friendship Centre along with locals from the village. Four chapters of AID helped out with the funding of 12 lakhs.

The whole village had a part to play in it. The whole structure of the project, from the check damn, the canal, the tank and the powerhouse, most of the structures were built by voluntary labourers living in the Bilgaon village.

Electricity meant people could now draw water a lot more easily for drinking and irrigation. It also helped with the oil-extraction unit. Working bulbs also meant that the boarding school could now have children study in the evening or sometimes, even at night.

It was cost-effective too. Before the project, the monthly expenditure of a family would be anywhere around Rs 150, a sizeable amount for farmers, thanks to the use of kerosene for lighting of lamps and lanterns. Now, it would oscillate anywhere between Rs 20 and Rs 30. They had to make it equitable, in order to make it self-sustainable. The money was used in operation, maintenance, and if required, expansion of the unit. Everything was charged for. A bulb would cost anywhere around Rs 10 per month, and Rs 30 per month for a television. Back then Bilgaon had 5 TVs.

Such was the success of the town, that it pretty much became a benchmark of sustainable development for the rest of the country. 'People's Power', hailed the villagers as politicians started milking Bailgaon in their speeches. Maharashtra Government's Energy Development Association proposed that they recreated the Bailgaon project in the surrounding villages. But that, of course, never happened.

It could've been a 'happily ever after' story, but things turned sour pretty soon. Only three and a half years down the line, everything was gone. In August 2006, the Bailgaon microhydel project got completely washed away due to the backwater effect of the Sardar Sarovar Dam. Tumultuous rainfall leading to the rise of water levels flooded a number of villages along the Narmada, including Bailgaon. What was supposed to be a benchmark of sustainable energy for thousands of villages across the country, ended up being washed away by 'modern' India.

Aravinda and Ravi, along with AID, carry on working tirelessly for a number of issues and projects from around the country. They have played a big part in the Narmada Bachao Andolan, and carry on fighting for the betterment of the tribals in Maharashtra."

The spear, once the epitome of technological innovation now only appears in stories of wildmen in the Nicobar islands.It took 400,000 years to go from spear to rockets but only a few decades to get you the smart-phone. This exponential advancement in technology has created a problem. It's changing the way we work.

Today's 10 highest paying jobs did not exist 20 years ago. We are not prepared for future jobs. We need the internet to save us! Here is how:

All future jobs require 2 expertise to be married (cross-disciplinary).

Only experts can teach us on the internet. Nobody can go back to school.

The answer is to upgrade your knowledge by learning online and marry it with your existing expertise. There are a few places you can do this like LearnApp, Udacity, Udemy or Upgrad. There are two kinds of upgrades:

Cross-disciplinary

If you already specialise in a field you need to find another field and marry the two. This creates a unique skill set that not many can replicate and helps in raising your salary. Steve Jobs brought his love for calligraphy to computers and called them 'Fonts' or Charlie Chaplin brought humour to video and called it 'Entertainment'. Walt Disney combined sound, sketching and motion pictures (Steamboat Willie) and created an entire industry

If you are great at excel and analyse data, you should learn R or a data visualisation tool to bring insight for businesses. Here are some more ideas you can play with:

Augmented reality UI, Designs and avatar creators. This discipline will need to marry an understanding of 3D spaces with design and interaction.

Gene editing. This totally new discipline (CRISPR) allows us to edit genes. There will be a lot of work around the legalities of this, morale/human/animal rights, farming, vaccines or human organ design (wow) etc.. This, by far is the most technically demanding on the list.

Personalised medical officer. With the advent of personal data on the health of an individual, medicine will become more personalised relying on patient-specific data rather than the current symptomatic approach. People in the medical profession will need to marry data analytics and insights to get this job.

Software developer for cars. Electric autonomous vehicles are the future. Software developers who will be mechanics for our high tech cars are inevitable. This job is not far away, Maruti for example targets to launch 4 electric cars around 2020 and countless companies are trying to make autonomous vehicles possible.

This list is endless. The only way to future proof yourself is to make sure you follow what interests you apart from your main expertise. I'm a stock market trader with a love for travelling, UI/UX design and storytelling, I found my 'marrying' of disciplines by building LearnApp.co

For more recent works of marrying disciplines see this list:

Marry augmented reality and gameplay as seen by Pokemon Go.

Marry e-commerce and untouched offline marketplaces (connecting farmers to marketplaces, new shelf space for marketplaces.)

Marry government public data to data visualisation (potholes on the road, the budget of building a flyover)

Marry online creditworthiness to rural India (the credit system has to be reinvented completely.)

My parents had always given me the freedom to travel alone and explore new places but this time, it was tough to convince them about my plans. To reinforce their faith in me to travel to a border area was difficult, even more so to reaffirm that I will be safe.

Upon reaching, I was greeted with green pastures surrounded by an expanse of meadows. Not shockingly, I was taken in by Rajouri's exquisite beauty, and a history that harks back to many centuries; even finding mention in the travelogue of Chinese traveler Hiuen Tsang (who visited the town in 632 AD).

The same area is now marked by conflict, militancy, and everyday encounters. Strident and grueling politics of the government has hardened the line of differences between locals and the Indian state.

The unexpected presence of Kashmiri students in militant ranks has sparked a debate about the hostility against the State and the feeling of exclusion felt by Kashmiris.

I had expected to be presented with a reality which we seem to be familiar with - that there isn't an inclination to study, and students are actively taking up arms against the web of deceit spun by the government. But,

I asked myself why. That query led me to a more pertinent question - was there widespread disappointment amongst the people regarding the educational development of the state?

I was eager to get these answers. Only, they were not what I had expected.

My travel to Rajouri was largely secured and ensured by a professor from Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University (BGSBU). Here was a university between lush green forests; disconnected from the city. It catered to a large number of students ­who were mostly from Kashmir, especially its farthest corners.

Despite initial reservations from both sides, I started interacting with the students enrolled there. Little did I know, it would shatter my pre-conceived notions of what I had heard about the university's troubled past, and Kashmir itself.

Beyond the compassion and warmth of everyone I met, what I had learned (and unlearned) about Kashmir surpassed my expectations.

Our discussions varied from exposure to Kashmiri culture to recent agitations against political authorities. The latter required discretion from both sides. Yet, there was a consensus on the degraded condition of their education system. As a student told me,

""My admission got delayed because I received my degree certificates late. These late results amongst many other factors are reasons behind frustration amongst the student community.""

Another source of frustration is the difficulty faced by the introduction of English education to their system. English language is dynamic and evolving, I was told, while Kashmiri is static. As a result, people are getting disconnected with their culture. To overcome these challenges, doctoral students are taking it upon themselves to keep their native language alive.

A student told me, ""since our language and culture is deeply embedded into our lives, some of the students are leading the programs of reviving their roots by teaching Kashmiri to primary and secondary school students.""

In fact, the university has a centre for cultural revival that teaches Urdu and Gujjari as well.

The media reports often about the closure of educational institutions due to the subversive activities across the state, that causes instability and miseries amongst the people living in border areas. But there are various other lesser known problems.

Also Read : My Report I TISS Scrapped my Course & Plans to Shut my Hostel Too

For example, I was told that there is a lack of funds provided to the state universities, complicating the matter further. This has a damaging effect on the availability of standard reading material, which has made it difficult to sustain academic spaces.

It was shocking to learn that doctoral students had barely heard about JStor and Scribd, two online databases that us students liberally use back in Delhi for academic papers.

At best, I realised how modest and sincere Kashmiri youth were. They shared their sentiments with me through which I got a glimpse of their predicament and sense of uncertainty regarding their future. The reality of Kashmiri students and their plight is far detached from the drawing room conversations outsiders luxuriously indulge in.

There are many grievances which have to be immediately addressed by the Indian government since these activities are affecting the psyche of the Kashmiri students. Till then, through cultural revival and a diverse student body, these students bring alive their aim of nation building, finding light at the end of a long tunnel.

Luke Hunt's lecture at the red-brick, colonnaded building that houses the Department of Journalism and Communication at the University of Madras, is full of geo-political parables. The 56-year-old Australian journalist who was in Chennai recently speaks of his moment of glory on a night of blistering gunfire, when travelling with US forces on a road pock-marked with shells.

""Being the first journalist to cross the Diyala river into Baghdad with the Marines and beating Associated Press (AP) by 10 minutes was one of them. I was with Agence France-Presse (AFP) then,"" he laughs, then adds softly, ""Seeing an execution go wrong in Afghanistan; witnessing a woman being flogged to death by the Taliban; suicide bombings in Sri Lanka... you are pouring sweat and standing in a slush of dead people, these were some of the lows. Nothing changes in combat. To not have the Vietnam War, there should not have been the Cold War or the World Wars or the French Revolution. The world is a train of individual experiences that keeps going forward and no matter how many nasty wars happen, nothing stops the brutality.""

A senior lecturer at Pannasastra University, Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where he wrote the course War, Media and International Relations, Hunt has been AFP's bureau chief in Afghanistan and Cambodia, and written for The Age in his native Melbourne, The New York Times, The Times, The Economist and is a columnist on Southeast Asia for The Diplomat.

He's also authored books -- his latest, Punji Trap -- Pham Xuan An: The Spy Who Didn't Love Us, bears stories from the Vietnam War and was almost 20 years in the writing. ""I had a lot of information off the record and after mulling over it and meeting An, I decided to tell the story of how An, a journalist for Time, Reuters and New York Herald Tribune, was also simultaneously spying for Vietnam.""

Before Hunt came of age professionally at a time when there was more aura around frontline journalism, working in situations that would've pinned most people to the ground in terror, he grew up in Springvale, a working-class suburb in Melbourne.

""I loved to write and never argued with my mother. Instead I wrote her notes. I had a bond with newspapers that celebrated Asian cultures and knew people who went off to the Vietnam War. I was encouraged to leave school and worked as a painter and decorator for a while. I hated it, went back to university at Deakin and studied journalism.""

Hunt's attempts to catalogue life on the battlefield have won him awards from the World Association of Newspapers and Amnesty, among accolades from the UN for his coverage in Afghanistan. ""Journalists keep a check on combatants by telling the world what's going on. Only then can other people act.""

Hunt adds, ""no one needs to die for me to get a story. And no journalist should have to die to get a story. If the situation demands that I put my camera down and help, I'll help. We've abandoned stories to help refugees and people in the frontline. If you think your job is too noble to help, that's nonsense.""

In three decades of being on ground in Asia, Hunt says that politics hasn't changed as much as the nature of the coverage of news. ""It's now all about technology. There was a time when we had to get to the frontline to confirm what was happening. With technology, you can pass on a smartphone to someone headed there and get a story faster on Facebook. That's not great journalism but if you are an editor and have to weigh the risks, the costs versus news that's already coming in from the frontline, it's not worth putting someone's life in danger.""

He adds, ""Although media houses have done tremendous damage to themselves by cashing in on the Internet game, you still need to get there and verify. The world gets fatigued with conflict news. But, if you tell a story well, despite language barriers, you will find an audience.""

Has there been a conflict he wished he had covered? ""In my entire career I've maintained one maxim,"" says Hunt. ""It's important to be of your time. I can't wish I had covered the Second World War. I need to be concerned about what's happening now.""

How does he deal with the uncertainty of being a civilian covering a war? When headed to conflict zones Hunt says he carries a little stuffed dog gifted by his nephew with him, as a talisman. And the blood and gore, the horror of crossing a child amputee on the run or the terror of being in the sights of a gun-toting mujahid? How does he shake off the trauma of what he has seen? He smiles -- ""I just go drink beer."""

Why was I so easily duped? And why do so many of us still ""believe"" in government? I find that people in the West have a healthy level of scepticism about governments but in India, the government is almost worshipped.

The cause lies in our neglect of economics education.

As a science student, I recall looking down upon those who studied the humanities. For seventy years we have channelled our best talent into engineering and medicine, to the utter neglect of economics. Yes, we have universities where academics make a living from teaching Marx, but Marx was so bad as an economist he would fail the most basic modern economics course today. I'm talking about real economics.

It was only by accident that I took up economics, and much later, when I was nearly 40 years old, I realised the terrible cost India has paid for its lack of economics education. I now believe that there is no discipline more important for society than economics. A nation that doesn't do economics right will fail at everything else.

Today, a new trend has emerged in India, with engineers like Kerijwal propounding public policy. There is a perception that if you're from IIT, you are automatically good at public policy. But public policy is fundamentally different from physics and biology.

Public policy requires the ability to look inside the minds of people, to understand how they will behave under various circumstances. This is pretty hard, and if one has specialised in the physical sciences science, it becomes close to impossible to understand the human mind.

That's because physical science deals with simple objects like the atom or gene. The physical world can be summarised in mathematical laws and tested empirically. But humans are the most complex machine built, refined and polished by billions of years of evolution. The linear approach we use to comprehend the physical world totally fails with humans.

Humans have a vast number of talents including an ability to deceive and mislead. Even economists have been misled. Game theorists were surprised when their predictions failed. That is because we behave quite differently when we are being watched, compared with what we do when we think we are not being watched. No atom is stealthy and strategic. Humans are.

What appears on the surface with humans is not necessarily the reality. A politician says that he wants to ""serve"" us, but the reality is quite different. To find out what is going on inside the mind of a minister or bureaucrat, we need to understand their incentives and opportunities.

The advantage the West has is that many of its policymakers actually understand economics. And so even though Western governments often fail to deliver, they are usually stopped from even more stupid actions by the economists who advise them. In India, on the other hand, virtually no one in government understands economics. And almost all our IAS officers are socialists, totally ignorant about economics (I say this from personal experience).

The shortfall in economics education in India is almost insurmountable. Economics is not taught in most schools, and where it is taught, the focus is not on building an economic intuition. The situation today is that an average child, happy to trust his parents, transfers that trust to the government as he grows into an adult. That is a fatal mistake.

After 36 years of experience in public policy, I believe that every child in the world must be immunised from the killer disease of socialism by being taught the economic intuition. Doing so is even more important than teaching personal hygiene. Our children must develop a healthy (and well reasoned) faith in markets and a deep scepticism for the government.

Since I could not find any book that would teach children and young teenagers this economic intuition, I wrote one myself earlier this year. Economics is all about seeing the invisible, so the book is called Seeing the Invisible. I'm delighted that Vernon Smith - Nobel prize winner in economics and one of the greatest economists alive - consider it to be a ""great book"". I've made sure that this book is available and will continue to be available free of cost on the internet.

One school in Guwahati has taken up an experiment to teach this book and I look forward to their results so the book can be improved.

I write this blog in the same spirit - to expound the economic intuition, illustrating it with various issues - so that readers can develop a stronger faith in the market and greater scepticism of government."

The only mechanism that's still working, is a lever that helps switch from one track onto another. Ahead on the tracks, you see five people tied down. You're hurtling right towards them, it's inevitable that you'll run them over -- except, there's another track that bifurcates to the left. Then you notice that on this track too, one person has been tied down. What should you do? Continue and cause the deaths of five people, or switch tracks and kill only one?

""The Trolley Problem"" has long been used as a thought experiment in Ethics/Moral Philosophy.

On Sunday, 16 December, noted Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari used it to explain the problems that lie ahead for makers of self-driving cars.

Harari -- the author of Sapiens, Homo Deux, and 21 Lessons for the 21st Century -- was in Mumbai to deliver the Penguin India Annual Lecture 2018. His talk touched upon 'Challenges for the 21st Century', and if, by session's end, many people in the audience were still considering having children, it would have been a surprise.

Not that Harari's talk was filled with doomsday prophesies. Nor did he paint a picture of the future so dystopian that it would rival the portrait of humanity presented by that other pessimistic philosopher Thomas Hobbes (who described mankind in its natural state as ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short"").

No.

But what he did say was sufficiently alarming.

For instance: ""Human beings are the gods on earth, but we're very irresponsible gods... Throughout history, human beings have been manipulating the world around them long before they've understood it.""

If that wasn't enough to send you into a funk about the wretchedness of the species we belong to, there were the challenges Harari dwelt on: Nuclear war, climate change, and technology. He stressed that none of these could be solved without global cooperation.

Technology, especially, was going to change the world even more than it already had, Harari warned, and we needed to brace for it.

""The last time we had a big technological revolution -- the Industrial Revolution -- it resulted in the creation of the working class,"" he said. But the next technological revolution would create a ""non-working class"".

""Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics will lead to the disappearance of many jobs by 2050, but the bigger issue will be retraining people for new types of jobs. You'd need to learn a lot of new skills and in some cases, change your personality,"" Harari said, adding, ""And this will not be a long-term solution. Because one of the most important things to remember about the automation revolution is, it will not (unfold) as one watershed happening. We will have a bigger revolution by 2025, then by 2035, then 2045. So to stay relevant, people will have to reinvent themselves every few years.""

In a scenario like this, governments would need to step in and help people through these difficult transition phases. But even this, Harari said, would not be enough to deal with the psychological effects of the need for constant reinvention. ""Will you have the mental resilience? Reinventing yourself at several phases through your life would be simply too difficult for most people. And as life expectancy increases, the age of retirement will be pushed back. People will have to fight against uselessness,"" Harari stressed.

The biggest struggle for people in the 21st century, he concluded, would be against irrelevance.

The question that naturally arose, was what the education system might do to prepare citizens for the world they would inhabit, or ""what should we teach children in school now that will be useful for them over the next 50 years"" as Harari framed it. ""No one knows what the job market will be like in 30 years, and that's unprecedented in history,"" he pointed out. ""Teachers and children won't know what is needed for anyone to be a fruitful member of society."" The answer then, was to focus on building emotional intelligence and mental resilience.

This technology-driven future would mean changes outside of our work lives too. Religion, for instance, would have to adapt; some would survive, others would go extinct. ""Religion has been around for a very long time; it will merely change its face. Religions keep adapting all the time, and then they say 'We didn't change anything!' They say they're retaining the original purity but it's a way of repackaging change,"" Harari said.

The nature of governments too would change. Harari posited the rise of digital dictatorships, by saying: ""New technologies might tempt governments across the world to monitor and control people all the time. New totalitarian regimes will have technologies that weren't available to a Hitler or Mao -- they'll take have the ability to 'hack' human beings"".

'Hacking' a human being required a good understanding of biology (especially brain science), a lot of data (especially personal data), and a lot of computing power. ""These things weren't around in the times of Hitler or Stalin, so even if the Gestapo or KGB followed you around 24/7, they wouldn't be able to tell what you were thinking or feeling or predict what you would do,"" Harari said, adding that these resources were exactly what new leaders had/would have access to.

As for the leaders themselves, Harari said citizens needed to ask politicians running for office how they intended to deal with the spectre of nuclear war, climate change and technological disruptions. ""The problem (now) is no one can come up with a meaningful vision for the future. Populist regimes with their fantasies can sustain themselves for a few years. But unless we can find some meaningful vision for the future, we're headed for disaster. If a politician has nothing meaningful to say about the future, don't vote for that politician,"" he asserted.

Those espousing isolationist politics too had no place in Harari's conception of the future.

""Leaders have become far more reckless in their behaviour and far more isolationist,"" he said. ""This is exceedingly irresponsible because in the 21st century, the idea of an independent nation is a fantasy.""

""Whenever a leader says 'My country first' or 'Only my country is important' we need to ask them, how their country will by themselves deal with these three issues,"" Harari said. ""Nationalism does have an important role in the 21st century, but to be a good nationalist -- which means protecting your country's interests, not hating foreigners -- you must also be a globalist. So if you take away from this talk a single lesson, it is that our global problems demand global solutions.""

Lest he give the audience the impression that all was bleak, Harari clarified, ""(What I've outlined in my talk) is neither inevitable nor a prophecy, these are possibilities. Technology is not deterministic. It can be used for a variety of purposes. Technology gives us the choice, but ultimately its use is in the hands of humans. We can use AI and biotechnology to create different types of society.""

The need of the hour, was ethical training for software engineers. ""They need it even more than lawyers and judges. They shape the world. For instance, more and more today, the question of discrimination turns out to be a question of design. We need to look at how software is designed. We need to ensure that algorithms do not discriminate against other people."" Harari said.

It was at this point that Harari brought up his version of the Trolley Problem.

""I've focused on the dangers of these technologies, but they have huge advantages. The vast majority of traffic accidents for instance, are caused by human error. If we replace humans at the wheel with driverless cars, we could save a million people a year,"" he said.

Makers of driverless cars though, would have to think about ethics.

Harari asked the audience to imagine a driverless car was going down a road, with its owner asleep in the back seat, when two children suddenly shot out in front of it. Should the car continue straight ahead (and kill the children) or veer away from them, only to collide with an oncoming truck, that was sure to cause the death of the owner?

""Computers don't have a subconscious. They do whatever you programme them to do,"" he pointed out. So you could have the best philosophers in the world in a room and give them a year to decide [what the driverless car should do], and that's what the car would be programmed to do.

If you left the decision to the makers, Harari said, they'd come up with two models of cars: ""Tesla Altruist and Tesla Egoist"" and leave it up to the buyer to choose, because the ""customer is always right"".

""These are questions that philosophers have been debating thousands and thousands of years, but they had very little practical import. These questions of ethics are now related to practical questions of engineering,"" Harari said. ""We've always needed philosophers and spiritual guides, but we need them now more than ever before because we're more powerful now than ever before.""

The company is hiring for its newly inaugurated Gurgaon office.

Like a typical startup, AglaSem EduTech Pvt Ltd had a humble beginning. From a small rented room occupied by 4 people, today the company is a creative ground for 80 young people who are full of ideas and passionate about what they do. The company has opened its doors wide to hire 200 Graduate Freshers in various teams.

The new office of aglasem.com is in Gurgaon Sector 30, on NH 8. ""We were operating in Delhi for some years, when on the suggestion of a close friend, we decided to open a corporate office in Gurgaon. It was one of our best decisions!"", AglaSem co-founder Anand says. He adds, ""The corporate culture in this place is very conducive to building a team, which we are focused on right now. Metro connectivity, safety for employees, were our top priorities when we zeroed in on this location last year when we started operations in Gurgaon.""

Today the company works primarily from Gurgaon and it recently moved to a larger office to accommodate the growing team and make room for more team members which the HR department is aggressively trying to bring on board.

As soon as one steps into the office, the energy in the air is noticeable. Most of the team members are quite young. However, senior members and leaders are spread across and can be seen mentoring one on one.

While there is a palpable buzz of activities at the workstations, meeting rooms, conference, some members can be seen chilling in the cafeteria or sparring over ideas in the brainstorming room. The YouTube room also has an ongoing shooting.

Expanding team in ongoing projects, and to launch new projects they have in the pipeline, AglaSem is hiring 200 Graduate Freshers for aglasem.com. The teams in which candidates are invited to apply are Content Writing (English), Content Writing (Hindi), YouTube Specialists, Software Engineers.

The company encourages such candidates to apply who enjoy working in the respective fields. Candidates can send either apply through Naukri.com under AglaSem Recruitment or send their CVs with a short email to hr@aglasem.com.

""We are looking for passionate youngsters who wish to learn and grow in their career. They should be actually interested in that work. For example, a content writer should enjoy writing and a software engineer should enjoy coding,"" said Shivani Dagar who is handling Talent Acquisition at AglaSem. Candidates with graduation from any stream are welcome. She adds, ""All degrees (streams) are treated equally. However, internships do play an important role."" A quick peek at her day planner shows that there are more than a dozen interviews scheduled that day.

The selection process consists of three rounds. First is a written test which depends on the position applied for. Then is the HR round which is a PI. Third is a final personal interview. All the rounds help the company understand the candidate better and vice versa. Arunima who leads the content team at AglaSem throws some light on what she looks for in her team members. ""I always ask them these questions; Do you write for yourself? Do you read? Why do you want to be a writer in the education sector? It is very important that the person has a flair for writing.""

While the company has long been content focused, with 'Updated, Authentic, Free' being its motto, they have recently created a tech team. Led by Nikhil who has an industry experience of 7 years, the team aims to give users a better experience and provide useful tools, apps, models for them. Within a month of inception, the team has launched an AglaSem Mock Test platform which already has 50000 registered users. Enthusiastic developers are welcome in their team.

The management is focused upon team building and they understand it is a slow-and-steady task. Learning is an ongoing process for team members at all levels. The immediate goals of this process are to ensure that all team members have good learning opportunities, room for growth within the company, security and stability, and challenges at regular intervals for steady growth at all levels.

While many job seekers who come for interview research about the company, one of the most frequently asked questions is about what does AglaSem do. To answer it, here is a brief overview.

There are two aspects of education and career covered by the company; information and resources. There are over 1000 exams in India, including those taken by school students, entrance exams, government job exams. Say there is a student of class 10th who is about to appear for his board exams. He needs to know exam dates, when and how will he get hall ticket, and when are results. Also, he would like to appear in scholarship exams like NTSE.

So the information pertaining to these, all exams that are relevant to that student, is provided on time and accurately at AglaSem. Now the other aspect involves resources related these exams which comprise of study material, preparation tips, what books to read, and so on. Similarly, information and resources are provided to all students of class 6 to 12, students who seek admission in colleges, students who are wishing to pursue post-graduation, and candidates who are preparing for government job exams. All information and resources are provided free of cost. The motto of AglaSem is 'Updated, Authentic, Free.' (ANI-BusinessWireIndia)"

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is a such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""

In the 21st century the luminous technological wave has become the DNA of the world we inhabit. Owing to this wave the way of doing business has evolved and so have education, academics, learning and development. All these have undergone a paradigm shift and have become tremendously technologically driven given the need of the times we have become a part of.

What is expected of students and what they expect out of academia has also evolved and adapted to this paradigm shift. We have entered an age where just knowing what the text books tell you is not enough. The triumphant are those who explore, learn and grow beyond.

Supplementary

IT Quizzes have in a way become the supplement to the education system and in their own way have intertwined with the school calendar itself. Though the system does dwell into teaching computer science but the on ground reality is that it's done in a primeval sense, they teach the students how to use the computer and some advanced schools even teach basic C++. But what it doesn't dwell into is the world of technology per se. Thus the gap created between the course curriculum and the business criteria could be bridged with constant updating of one's knowledge base in an agile, intelligent way which is also aligned with the fourth industrial revolution.

The students themselves not only want to enhance their current affairs, but they want to gain knowledge, seek opportunities to excel beyond academics and secure their future themselves.

With reinvention and re-imagination of education, the perception about quizzing is also evolving along with the phenomena itself. Quizzing today is not only about enhancing general knowledge, but also about connecting the dots, logical reasoning and understanding the scenario to come to a concrete conclusion. Quizzes play an important role to prepare students for the real world and to satiate the knowledge hunger within them.

In many ways the quizzes that started as a contest grew to become a knowledge movement with schools. For the schools, the quiz was an important window to the changes that were happening in the IT environment. Programmes such as these, over time start helping in building a better nation and the quiz becomes the mere trigger. Subjects like IT in schools are trying to catch up with their students as they adapt to newer trends and tech platforms with agility.

Quizzes like the TCS IT wiz stand out in this space as they challenge these ""savvy students"" and force them to think beyond. It therefore becomes a very important component as it serves as a motivator and caters to the aspiration of a fast paced generation.

Growth

The technological wave has also touched the format and presentation of quizzes. If one looks back to 1999 when it all began, quizzing was just progressing from 33mm slides that were run on carousels to power-point based quizzes -- which was then a happening trend. In two decades it has moved so forward that we now power our shows with animations and gaming platforms which also help keep the quiz relevant to the generation we cater to.

Social networking sites also play a crucial role, as we cater to the 'Digital Natives'. Social networks formed around the event and the coming together of sharp young minds from across the nation onto these platforms actually triggered not just discussions on technologies or the quizzes, but far broader aspects such as career, higher education and so on.

The digital natives are adept in nature owing to the resources they are exposed to and the zeal they have garnered owing to this exposure. They have incorporated the paradigm shift and have realised that the 'X' factor lies beyond the set curriculum and this is where 'Quizzing' comes in and facilitates that. It becomes the platform to titillate the young and brilliant minds and provide the acumen driven challenge they want."

The new house for Keerthi, a Class X student of Neyyattinkara government school and Deepthi a Class IV student of JBS School at Neyyattinkara was constructed using the funds raised by neighbours. A house warming ceremony was held on Saturday, in which Neyyattinkara MLA K Ansalan handed over the key of the house to the sisters.

The children had lost their father Prakash in 2015 (who drowned in a nearby pond) and mother Indu in 2016 (who died following a complicated elephantiasis infection). Ever since, the sisters were living with their maternal aunt Latha and family, who are daily wage labourers.

The market dynamic forces have been determined after conducting a detailed study of the Global Recycled Metal Market.

Europe recycled metal market share is projected witness gains of more than 4% during the forecast timeframe. This is primarily due to stringent laws and legislations imposed by environmental regulatory bodies in Europe, which has triggered metal recycling to reduce the carbon footprint and help save the environment from hazardous waste generated. For instance, Directive 2008/98/EC imposed by European Commission defines basic concepts related to waste management.

According to a new research report by Global Market Insights, Inc. Recycled Metal Market size is forecast to exceed USD 125 billion by 2024

Industry Growth drivers are

* Rapidly growing construction industry in the Asia Pacific and the Middle East

* Strong product demand from electrical & electronics industry in North America

* Stringent & supporting legislations for metal recycling in Europe

It signifies terms and conditions related to waste, recycling and recovery. Moreover, Directive 2012/19/EU prevent the generation of electrical & electronic waste and to promote reuse, recycling and other forms of recovery to reduce the quantity of waste to be eliminated, whilst also improving the environmental performance. These trends are likely to make significant impact on the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Recycled non ferrous metal market size was valued more than USD 90 billion in 2017. Non ferrous metals such as aluminum, copper, lead, precious metals and other metals such as nickel, zinc, tin, palladium, etc. These metals find wide-ranging applications across construction, electrical & electronics, transport, consumer goods, industrial machinery, nuclear, military and several other end-user industry. For instance, lead is widely used electronics in batteries, ammunition, cable sheathing, etc.

Lead batteries are used in transport industry and constituted approximately 35% of the total industry share in terms of volume in 2017. These trends will help boost the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

In terms of volume, recycled metal market share for building & construction constituted close to 45% of the total business share in 2017. It is mainly due to comprehensive recycled metal applications in the building & construction industry. For example, ferrous metals (iron and steel) are broadly used in the construction of large steel frameworks in the building, bridges, drainage components and various other architectural frameworks.

Furthermore, non ferrous metals including aluminum, copper and lead are also utilized in the building & construction sector. Lead sheets are used for roofing, cladding of vertical walls, soundproofing in partitions and ceilings in office, school and hotel buildings. These trends will help make considerable contribution to reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

North America electrical & electronics industry is on the rise which is due to consistently changing consumer's preferences and continuous technology upgradation. For instance, the electrical & electronics industry was valued more than USD 900 billion in 2016 and accounted for a total of 21% of the global electrical & electronics industry. These trends will drive reprocessed metal demand owing to its wide spread applications in metal plating electronics via electrodeposition. It provides improved corrosion resistance, enhanced electrical conductivity and improved solderability which helps in protecting against wear.

Furthermore, precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum, rhodium, etc. are also widely applicable in the electronics industry owing to its unique physical and chemical properties which provides reliability to the electronics sector. It will help attain significant gains to the global recycled metal market share by 2024.

Ineffective metal reprocessing is a key constraint which is probable to impede the global reprocessed metal market size by 2024. For instance, only 40% of the total copper produced is attained from recycling and 33% of the total aluminum produced is attained from recycling process. Nevertheless, rising emphasis on metal processing and reusability to reduce carbon footprint and impact of hazardous waste will generate plentiful opportunities for the reprocessed metal market size by 2024.

Key reprocessed metal market players are Sims Metal Management, Steel Dynamics, European Metal Recycling, Nucor Corporation, ELG HanielGmbh, Schnitzer Steel and Novelis. The market players are expanding their capacity to process metal to attain profitability in the market. For example, Novelis announced to build flat-rolled aluminum plant in January 2018 in Kentucky U.S. for USD 300 million.

The residents called for collective action (they called it ""Milke Chalo""), describing air pollution as the city's most pressing concern. The participating environmentalists and doctors formed an expert panel and insisted that providing clean air should be part of the manifestos of parties in the upcoming General Elections. Children too participated enthusiastically, putting up a street play and a stirring song, ""Neelein aasmaan mein, jhilmil hawa mein, yeh kaala rang kyon daala. Ruk jaao. (Under the blue sky, with rippling winds, why have you poured this dark shadow. Stop.)"", was sung by a group from the music academy Kirana Gharaana.

Vijay Dhasmana of NGO 'IamGurugram' told TOI, ""The aim of this event is not only to spread awareness, but also to take collective action and demand the right to clean air."" He also spoke of the importance of Aravalis in protecting the Delhi-NCR region from rising air pollution. ""The degradation of the Aravalis is linked to poor air quality, water shortage and water pollution in the region. The solution is to protect Aravalis and other urban forests,"" he said.

""This is the first inclusive event where urbanites, villagers and neighbourhood schools came together for collective action. It's extremely important, as we can't have only two days of clean air each year. We need clean air all year long,"" said Smita Ahuja of a citizen's group working on environmental issues.

Children said air pollution is killing them every day. Ronniet Biala (11) said, ""Air pollution is like a weapon. It's literally killing us. Schools are shut and we are restricted from participating in outdoor sports. My school is only 1km away from my home, yet I have to take a bus because roads are not safe and dusty."" Avira (9), who is suffering from severe effects of air pollution, said, ""Who is responsible for this air pollution? Not only me. Not only you, but everyone.""

Both urbanites and villagers reiterated the need to take steps at individual, community (RWA and panchayat) and city-levels, by raising awareness. They emphasised on the need for residents and authorities to work together to address the problem. Dr Himanshu Garg said, ""If lungs are damaged, there is nothing we can do. Unlike in case of the heart, we can't have lung bypasses or lung stents. Only prevention can help us deal with rising cases of respiratory illness. There is a need to introduce public policy that can help reduce air pollution.""

Villagers said they are equally affected by increasing air pollution. ""Rural areas are worse off than urban areas, as roads are dusty. Authorities should work on sources of pollution, not the symptoms,"" said Surender, a villager from Aya Nagar. Vinay Shankar, retired secretary (IAS), Government of India, said, ""We need to review the laws and policies on air pollution and enforce these properly.""

Sarika Panda Bhatt of World Resources Institute said development shouldn't only serve car owners. ""Only 10-12% of the people own cars. Yet, authorities are building new roads every day. The problem is not masks or air purifiers. The only solution is to stop the development that simply entails more roads and flyovers,"" she said.

Many raised a need for proper waste segregation to mitigate the impact of pollution. Keshav Jaini, a resident of the Garden Estate society, said, ""Air, water, and soil are closely related. If you pollute one, you pollute all. We produce huge amount of garbage in our country, and throw it all in landfills, which is the most valuable commodity our country has. Waste segregation must be done at source. Wet waste, which is 50% of all waste, should be composted, to reduce load of waste that goes into landfills.""

The event also witnessed a question and answer session, in which the audience asked the expert panel questions on taking precautions, wearing masks, using air purifiers and nebulizers, etc."

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

Written by Chris Buckley and Austin Ramzy

Muslim inmates from internment camps in far western China hunched over sewing machines, in row after row. They were among hundreds of thousands who had been detained and spent month after month renouncing their religious convictions. Now the government was showing them on television as models of repentance, earning good pay -- and political salvation -- as factory workers.

China's ruling Communist Party has said in a surge of upbeat propaganda that a sprawling network of camps in the Xinjiang region is providing job training and putting detainees on production lines for their own good, offering an escape from poverty, backwardness and the temptations of radical Islam.

But mounting evidence suggests a system of forced labor is emerging from the camps, a development likely to intensify international condemnation of China's drastic efforts to control and indoctrinate a Muslim ethnic minority population of more than 12 million in Xinjiang.

Accounts from the region, satellite images and previously unreported official documents indicate that growing numbers of detainees are being sent to new factories, built inside or near the camps, where inmates have little choice but to accept jobs and follow orders.

""These people who are detained provide free or low-cost forced labor for these factories,"" said Mehmet Volkan Kasikci, a researcher in Turkey who has collected accounts of inmates in the factories by interviewing relatives who have left China. ""Stories continue to come to me,"" he said.

China has defied an international outcry against the vast internment program in Xinjiang, which holds Muslims and forces them to renounce religious piety and pledge loyalty to the party. The emerging labor program underlines the government's determination to continue operating the camps despite calls from United Nations human rights officials, the United States and other governments to close them.

The program aims to transform scattered Uighurs, Kazakhs and other ethnic minorities -- many of them farmers, shopkeepers and tradespeople -- into a disciplined, Chinese-speaking industrial workforce, loyal to the Communist Party and factory bosses, according to official plans published online.

These documents describe the camps as vocational training centers and do not specify whether inmates are required to accept assignments to factories or other jobs. But pervasive restrictions on the movement and employment of Muslim minorities in Xinjiang, as well as a government effort to persuade businesses to open factories around the camps, suggest that they have little choice.

Independent accounts from inmates who have worked in the factories are rare. Police block attempts to get near the camps and closely monitor foreign journalists who travel to Xinjiang, making it all but impossible to conduct interviews in the region. And most Uighurs who have fled Xinjiang did so before the factory program grew in recent months.

But Serikzhan Bilash, a founder of Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights, an organization in Kazakhstan that helps ethnic Kazakhs who have left neighboring Xinjiang, said he had interviewed relatives of 10 inmates who had told their families that they were made to work in factories after undergoing indoctrination in the camps.

They mostly made clothes, and they called their employers ""black factories,"" because of the low wages and tough conditions, he said.

Kasikci also described several cases based on interviews with family members: Sofiya Tolybaiqyzy, who was sent from a camp to work in a carpet factory; Abil Amantai, 37, who was put in a camp a year ago and told relatives he was working in a textile factory for $95 a month; Nural Razila, 25, who had studied oil drilling but after a year in a camp was sent to a new textile factory nearby.

""It's not as though they have a choice of whether they get to work in a factory, or what factory they are assigned to,"" said Darren Byler, a lecturer at the University of Washington who studies Xinjiang and visited the region in April.

He said it was safe to conclude that hundreds of thousands of detainees could be compelled to work in factories if the program were put in place at all of the region's internment camps.

The Xinjiang government did not respond to faxed questions about the factories, nor did the State Council Information Office, the central government agency that answers reporters' questions.

The documents detail plans for inmates, even those formally released from the camps, to take jobs at factories that work closely with the camps to continue to monitor and control them. The socks, suits, skirts and other goods made by these laborers would be sold in Chinese stores and could trickle into overseas markets.

Kashgar, an ancient, predominantly Uighur area of southern Xinjiang that is a focus of the program, reported that in 2018 alone it aimed to send 100,000 inmates who had been through the ""vocational training centers"" to work in factories, according to a plan issued in August.

That figure may be an ambitious political goal rather than a realistic target. But it suggests how many Uighurs and other Muslim ethnic minorities may be held in the camps and sent to factories. Scholars have estimated that as many as 1 million people have been detained. The Chinese government has not issued or confirmed any figures.

""I don't see China yielding an inch on Xinjiang,"" said John Kamm, the founder of the Dui Hua Foundation, a San Francisco-based group that lobbies China on human rights issues. ""Now it seems we have entrepreneurs coming in and taking advantage of the situation.""

The evolution of the Xinjiang camps echoes China's ""re-education through labor"" system, where citizens once were sent without trial to toil for years. China abolished ""re-education through labor"" five years ago, but Xinjiang appears to be creating a new version.

Retailers in the United States and other countries should guard against buying goods made by workers from the Xinjiang camps, which could violate laws banning imports produced by prison or forced labor, Kamm said.

While the bulk of clothes and other textile goods manufactured in Xinjiang ends up in domestic and Central Asian markets, some makes its way to the United States and Europe.

Badger Sportswear, a company based in North Carolina, last month received a container of polyester knitted T-shirts from Hetian Taida, a company in Xinjiang that was shown on a prime-time state television broadcast promoting the camps.

The program showed workers at a Hetian Taida plant, including a woman who was described as a former camp inmate. But the small factory did not appear to be on a camp site, and it is unclear whether it made the T-shirts sent to North Carolina.

Ginny Gasswint, a Badger Sportswear executive, said the company had ordered a small amount of products from Xinjiang, and used Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production, a nonprofit certification organization, to ensure that its suppliers meet standards.

Seth Lennon, a spokesman for Worldwide, said that Hetian Taida had only recently enrolled in its program, and the organization had no information on possible coerced labor in Xinjiang. ""We will certainly look into this,"" he said.

Repeated calls over several days to Wu Hongbo, chairman of Hetian Taida, went unanswered.

Satellite imagery suggests that production lines are being built inside some internment camps.

Images of one camp featured in the state television broadcast, for example, show 10 to 12 large buildings with a single-story, one-room design commonly used for factories, said Nathan Ruser, a researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The buildings are surrounded by fencing and security towers, indicating that they are heavily guarded like the rest of the camp.

""It seems unlikely that any detainee would be able to go to any building that they were not taken to,"" Ruser said.

Commercial registration records also show at least a few companies have been established this year at addresses inside internment camps. They include a printing factory, a noodle factory and at least two clothing and textile manufacturers at camps in rural areas around Kashgar. Another clothing and bedding manufacturer is registered in a camp in Aksu in northwestern Xinjiang.

The government's effort to connect the internment camps with factories emerged this year as the number of detainees climbed and Xinjiang faced rising costs to build and run the camps.

Many camps were once called ""transformation through education centers"" by the government, reflecting their mission: inducing inmates to cast aside Islamic devotion and accept Communist Party supremacy.

But since August, the Chinese government has defended the camps by arguing that they are job training centers that will help lift detainees and their families out of poverty by giving them the skills to join China's economic mainstream. Many rural Uighurs speak little Chinese, and language training has been advertised as one of the main purposes of the camps.

Yet the practical training in the camps often appears to be rudimentary, said Adrian Zenz, a social scientist at the European School of Culture and Theology who has studied the campaign.

An early hint of the factory labor program came in March when Sun Ruizhe, president of the China National Textile and Apparel Council, described it to senior industry representatives, according to a transcript of his speech that was posted on industry websites.

Sun said that Xinjiang planned to recruit from three main sources to increase the textile and garment sector's workforce by more than 100,000 in 2018: impoverished households, struggling relatives of prisoners and detainees, and the camp inmates, whose training ""could be combined with developing the textile and apparel section.""

In April, the Xinjiang government began rolling out a plan to attract textile and garment companies. Local governments would receive funds to build production sites for them near the camps; companies would receive a subsidy of $260 to train each inmate they took on, as well other incentives.

In remarks in October defending the camps, a top official in Xinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, said the government was busy preparing ""job assignments"" for inmates formally finishing indoctrination and training. A budget document this year from Yarkant, a county in Kashgar, said the camps were responsible for ""employment services.""

The inmates assigned to factories may have to stay for years.

Byler said a relative of a Uighur friend was sent to an indoctrination camp in March and formally released this fall. But he was then told he had to work for up to three years in a clothing factory.

A government official, Byler said, suggested to his friend's family that if the relative worked hard, his time in the factory might be reduced.

The Chinese state media has praised the centers as leading wayward people toward modern civilization. It also reports that the workers are generously paid.

""The training will turn them from 'nomads' into skilled marvels,"" the official Xinjiang Daily said last month. ""Education and training will make them into 'modern people,' useful to society."""

CAPTION: If civilizations can be defined by single structures, that is what the Adil Shah palace means to Goa

An ugly surprise awaits visitors when they ascend the staircase to the Adil Shah palace on the Panaji waterfront. One side of the sprawling first floor hosts curated exhibitions by Rahaab Allana and Ranjit Hoskote among others. Those galleries brim full of spectacular images and artworks. But the rest of the space, officially dedicated by the state to public cultural events, is inexplicably closed off. It has been hijacked in plain sight by the perpetrators of Panaji's Smart City project.

It's hard to imagine how this could happen after two full decades of government-appointed studies and committees which consistently reiterated the Adil Shah palace (formerly the old state secretariat) has to be strictly reserved to host art and culture events, including a permanent collection of paintings to honour the legacy of 20th century Goans who profoundly shaped Indian modernism -- Trindade, da Fonseca, Francis Newton Souza, Vasudeo Gaitonde, and Laxman Pai. That very public understanding is now being betrayed openly. Even by the unbelievably poor standards of recent years, it's an unconscionable travesty.

If civilizations can be defined by single structures, that is what the Adil Shah palace means to Goa. Long before there was a city in Panaji, this particular spot was already formidably fortified. There is one plausible theory the city derives its name from five turrets that sprouted from what was latterly the summer palace of the Bijapuri dynasty. Later, after the incredible rise followed by the abrupt decline of what is now Old Goa, this magnificent building became the seat of the viceroy of the Estado da India, exerting power and influence across the vast maritime empire extending from Timor and Macau to Mozambique on the opposite side of the Indian Ocean. More recently, it housed the state legislature.

All that amazing history is traduced by the covert seizure of the historic monument, in the unforgivable absence of public consultation or meaningful oversight. All those glorious gallery spaces are now private domain. Excellent restoration of the building to global standards has been subverted, with air-conditioning ducts and vents punched into 500-year-old walls. Bureaucrats twiddle thumbs under million-dollar lighting systems that were imported specifically for viewing artworks. Perhaps worst of all, the heist of one side of the top floor has rendered the exhibition spaces inaccessible to the disabled, elderly and wheel-chair bound. This is the extent of Panaji's Smart City farce.

Adding insult to injury is the fact this is the 175th anniversary of Panaji becoming capital of Goa, a signal moment which signified tremendous power shifting from the colonial state to native elites. So many important civic developments happened here first -- the first girl's school in India, the first public library. It was the first city in the subcontinent to lay itself out in a grid, with ample sidewalks, drainage, and plenty of parks and gardens to allow breathing space. The rise of Nova Goa was an epic event for native self-confidence, and it's painful to acknowledge the state has done nothing to commemorate the milestone anniversary.

In recent years, the citizens of India's smallest state have resigned themselves to abysmal governance in the absence of leadership. They have weathered scandal and disappointment, and been forced to tolerate endless incompetence. For some time now, it has been clear that extra-smart operators are royally ripping off the exchequer in Panaji's name. All that is bad enough, but monument-grabbing is another level of outrage, being undertaken in the most brazen and bullying manner possible. It's hard to imagine how much worse could possibly be in store, but we are sure to find out in 2019.

Political parties are generally blamed for fomenting trouble in the valley and therefore the union government should allow the Indian Army to have a greater say in stamping out terrorism, said Gaurav Arya, a former Army major, on Saturday.

Arya made some shocking revelations and busted many myths about the current situation during a talk on 'Radicalization in Kashmir valley: New challenges', organized by Bhonsala Military School, at Chitnavis Centre.

""The Centre grants Rs92,500 per person to Jammu and Kashmir as compared to Rs4,000 to Uttar Pradesh. Then why is UP more developed than J&K? The reality is that these funds are devoured by politicians who have properties in UK, UAE and other countries. They seldom use this money for progress of the state,"" Arya said.

""Carrying out public works like building bridges, running schools and hospitals is not the job of the Army. This has to be done by the party in power and not by the Army whose job is to end terrorism. Therefore, political parties and the Army should play their part to restore peace in Kashmir,"" he said.

Arya said, ""What started as a mere conflict of interest has now blown out of proportion. Pakistan sends terrorists because it is a cheaper alternative than training army forces. These terrorists brainwash the common man and act against people's faith.""

""When the militancy was at its peak in 1989, people of J&K wanted freedom not just from India but also from Pakistan which was a bad news for both. Thereafter, Pakistan changed its tactics to rule Kashmir. It was now trying to establish an Islamic state by radicalizing the commoners in Kashmir,"" Arya claimed.

He also deemed internet as the latest tool for radicalization of masses and said, ""Forwarded fake messages on social media spread like wildfire which are enough to create mass hysteria.

He recalled late Chief Minister Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy's efforts in building the Vamsadhara project in the district.

Launching a scathing attack Chandrababu Naidu, YS Jagan said despite the TDP, along with Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik, being partners of the NDA in Vajpayee government, Chandrababu failed to resolve the issue.

In February 2005, Dr YSR inaugurated the Vamsadhara project and the Hiramandalam reservoir, putting an end to 55 year old dispute. In his tenure, Rs 930 crore were allotted for the project works. Of the allotted funds, Rs 720 crore were spent when he was alive.

The YSRCP chief said Chandrababu could not even complete the remaining Rs 55 crore worth project works. Instead, Chandrababu conspired to make money by escalating the project costs to Rs 420 to benefit his benami contractor CM Ramesh.

In Rajanna Rajyam, six canals, including the Jumuluru, Polaki and Bairi canals were merged into Vamsadhara. If YSRCP comes to power, the Vamsadhara and Naidupeta Barrage would be completed, he promised. Due to Chandrababu's misuse of power, 6,000 acres of land was affected. I feel proud to say that Dr YSR had built over 38,000 houses in this constituency, he added.

YS Jagan asked the locals if Chandrababu's 2014 promises of making the Rajam river a tourist attraction, drinking water to Jagannadhapuram in Narasannapeta, Ring Road, Saravakota mandal lift irrigation project, another PHC in Saravakota mandal and the railway over bridge in Janamuru mandal were implemented.

In this constituency 36 schools and 3 hostels were closed down in the last four years. YS Jagan said the YSRCP would give the 3,400 crore loss caused by cyclone Titli after coming to power. In Chandrababu Naidu's rule, the Titli cyclone incurred crop and property loss, but, not even a single rupee was given to the district. Till now, the State government released only Rs 520 crore towards relief activities.

Chandrababu's Heritage company purchases crops for a lower price from farmers and sells its products for 3-4 times the price, YS Jagan said.

In view of the expected election schedule in February and the elections in April, ""I urge everyone to think over the dire situation in the State"", he said.

YS Jagan said that women's self-help groups were cheated by Chandrababu. The YSRCP President said that in the name of loan waiver, Chandrababu had cheated the state to the tune of Rs 87,000 crores. It was not clear if the farmers got back the gold which they mortgaged in the banks, but they had got the bank notices for sure, he commented.

The YSRCP Chief informed the public gathering that Chandrababu had after promising to give Rs 2,000 to every household without employment. But with few months to go for polls, the TDP got away with providing Rs 1,000 per month to a few students while the 23,000 teacher posts were lying vacant in the State.

He pointed out that the women's self-help groups were also cheated and were not given loan waivers. The AP CM promised to build a house for every poor man in the state -- how many houses has he built till date?"" he asked.

The Polavaram project became a centre of corruption. In the last four years, only the foundation walls were built. But, the TDP leaders are claiming to have completed the construction. ""Finance Minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu's relative was awarded the contract works in Polavaram project,"" he said.

Could Chandrababu build the Amaravati capital city in the last four years? In Chandrababu's rule, the electricity charges, fuel prices, RTC bus charges, house tax , school fees etc. have skyrocketed. Chandrababu, who promised to provide nine hours of electricity to farmers, did not keep his word. Besides, the TDP is collecting huge revenue in the form of electricity bills, he said.

""The YSRCP government will provide Rs 15,000 per year to all mothers with school-going children, Rs 20,000 for hostel allowance to students in addition to the complete waiver of college fees. Under YSR Cheyootha scheme, women would be able to draw loans without hassles like bribes,"" he said to the public.

If YSRCP comes to power, the Arogyasri scheme, which saved many lives during Rajanna Rajyam, will be reinstated along with the 108 ambulances which had saved many lives under YSR rule, he pointed out. The 108 vehicles used to reach the patient within 20 minutes of intimation, he said. Rajanna Rajyam had an ambulance per mandal while today, not even a single ambulance is available per constituency, he remarked.

In 2014, Chandrababu vowed to ban all liquor shops in the state. But, after four years years of his rule, he has ensured that every village had a liquor shop, YS Jagan said.

Chandrababu proposed to forge an alliance with the TRS and after KTR rejected the offer, he went to New Delhi to join hands with the Congress. On 8 June, 2018, the Congress released a book on Chandrababu's corruption and failures. Within few months from the release, the people of Telangana gave a mandate that was a slap on the face of the Congress and TDP.

The TRS said it would enter Andhra Pradesh politics after Rs 140 crore belonging to the TDP were caught during the Telangana elections. Chandrababu, in response, reacted like a chameleon, raising the issue of the Special Category Status this time around. ""How could Chandrababu ask KTR for an alliance with TRS during the last rites of former MP Nandamuri Harikrishna?"" he asked.

YS Jagan explained the benefits of YSR Cheyootha scheme in Navaratnas. Through Village Secretariats, transparency, efficiency and employability would be improved in the State's governance, he said. Ration cards, ration supplies, pensions, unemployment allowance and other government benefits would be delivered to the homes in YSRCP rule, he asserted.

It's been a while since we've read a book, and thought how we need to carry it everywhere we go, because referencing it, would come in handy. The last time it happened was when this writer was down in the dumps, and believed that The Bible, would help get her through.

In school, it was the Pocket Oxford English Dictionary, our guide to building great vocabulary. Rituparna Sarkar's Wonder Words: Untranslatable Words From Around The World (Penguin Random House) is that book for us now. It's the kind of collection that would make any linguaphile go weak in their knees.

Rituparna Sarkar

Like Sarkar explains in the introduction that while English is spoken in 94 countries across the world - that is nearly one-third of the world's population - it is possibly not enough to explain everything we see and experience in the world. One could argue that it's not really the case, but wait till before you read this book, which comprises 65 words - Sarkar describes them as wonder words - from languages across the world.

For instance, recently on my birthday, I got myself a trim to cheer myself up. But my scissor-happy hairdresser ended up giving me a fringe that looked more like a 70s puff. It made me feel miserable, of course, and I don't think the English dictionary had a better word to articulate that torment. But Sarkar tells us about the Japanese word ""age-otori"" (say it like: aah-gay-oh-toh-ree), which is what you feel when you look worse after getting haircut.

We loved the Indonesian word ""desus"" (say it like: they-saa-s), which means the smooth sound of somebody farting quietly, and Romanian word ""door"" (say it like: door), which means the intense longing for someone you love, when you have separated from them. But our favourite is cafune (say it like: ka-foo-nay), a Portuguese word, which actually means to tenderly run your hands through a loved one's hair - remember that time, your mother did that, while oiling your hair?

Along with the words, Sarkar offers a simple guide on the word's origin, pronunciation and how it can be used in daily conversation. All of this together, makes it a keeper."

It's this modernist architectural marvel created by American architect Louis Kahn with B V Doshi and Anant Raje that lingers in the visitors' memory long after they leave the campus. It's the reason the 44-year old building - built between 1962 and 1974 - attracts close to 11,000 visitors annually from India and abroad. IIM-A celebrated its 57th foundation day on December 11.

Nishant Mehta, a 2003 PGP batch alumnus, who was part of the reunion on Saturday, told TOI that the architecture ensured that the enclosed spaces such as rooms and classrooms were smaller, and the corridors were wider. ""Unconsciously, it surely influenced our thinking process and pushed us outwards,"" he said.

IIM officials said that ever since they have started making a repository of the campus visitors, they found 30% of the visitors were art and architecture students who spent hours at the campus during the guided tour, making sketches or clicking pictures to capture the essence of the architectural aesthetics. Likewise, foreign nationals consist of about a quarter of the total visitors.

The tours take place every Wednesday and Friday - both for self-guided and guided mode. The tour consists of Harvard steps, Ravi J Mathai Auditorium, LKP, student dormitories, Vikram Sarabhai library and the subterranean tunnel connecting the old campus with the new on the other side of the road.

Cdr. Manoj Bhatt, chief administrative officer, IIM-A, said that the institute is a proud custodian of the architecture. ""The legendary architects conceived such a space for higher learning with natural material, simple design ensuring natural light and air. The central point of the institute - LKP - is not a construction but an open space, reflecting the philosophy of the institute,"" he said.

The structure is, however, not untouched by ravages of time and calamities like the 2001 earthquake.

""DDA had committed to provide 4,000 sq metre land for the school, which has been operating out of Eidgah since 1976 in Ballimaran.

Globalization has been recognized as one of the most significant forces of change for business in the current scenario and to a large extent enabler of increased prosperity around the world. How effective is management education for the globalized market space? What are the implications of globalization for the management education? How should the business schools prepare themselves to stay relevant in the globalized business environment? Is it within their means to comprehend the capability gap and engage in capacity building, beyond their own local context? These are some of the key questions that confront the business schools as they prepare themselves to address the challenges which come with growing organizational complexity in a rapidly changing business landscape and a need for new capabilities among employees.

Free trade and the gains from comparative advantage, understood since David Ricardo's ground breaking work in 1817, have encouraged deeper integration of markets with reduced trade barriers. Expanding the scope of the business by going for geographical diversity has become the preferred strategy for future growth. The developed economies have shown low growth rate with home markets maturing, while the contribution to the global GDP from emerging markets has grown steadily. Firm strategies envisioned for achieving growth targets above industry average are centered on tapping new customers as well as resources in unexplored markets. All this has resulted in an expanded business landscape of firms focused on multiple markets across borders and competition becoming global in nature. Despite the strong intent to capture a significant share of the global market, most firms feel limited by their global leadership capabilities.

The demand for managers capable of dealing with the emerging challenges and opportunities of globalization will continue to be on the rise. In a survey of senior executives, reported in a 2012 McKinsey article on 'Developing Global Leaders', by Pankaj Ghemawat, 76 percent believed their organizations needed to develop global-leadership capabilities, but only 7 percent thought they were currently doing so effectively. 30 percent of US companies had admitted that they had failed to exploit fully their international business opportunities because of insufficient internationally competent personnel. This is in sharp contrast to the mindset shift seen amongst the management graduates who are motivated to work in an international environment as they get comfortable with the rapid advancement in technology and the enhanced ease in mobility.

Business schools need to respond to the demands of the profession they serve. Through significant changes in the curricula and development of academic collaborations, business schools globally are trying to focus on capabilities needed by management professional to face the incomprehensible international business environment. A large number of business schools have undergone structural transformation of their programs to offer a more globalized education experience. Their pursuit for shaping global leaders is often driven by the rising demand for managers who can deal with the complex business environment, as well the growing number of managers aspiring for international careers. The pursuit is also driven by the desire to create a strong global brand and generate revenues by attracting international applicants for the management programs in International Business.

The business school curricula has evolved to focus on sharpening of the cognitive skills, ability to work through the incongruities diverse work environments demand; and developing social and networking skills for management graduates who seek international careers. Managers who can lead in a global context prove to be a critical resource for innovation and economic development. Content driven approach through class room learning of concepts and theoretical frameworks can achieve that in a limited manner. It is understood to work as a precondition but not a substitute for experiential learning. While there is much emphasis on theory-driven practice, there is incredible value in practice-driven theory. Therefore the emphasis on learning by doing through live projects and internships in different locations is being increasingly adopted by business schools. Use of technology to facilitating management education through distance learning is on the rise. Teams can be connected virtually to work on projects allowing them to share their own views on problems identified. Global alliances amongst business schools and institutions will play an important role in shaping the management graduates who should possess international experience, cultural awareness, and the ability to work in cross-cultural environments.

Efforts to invent delivery models which serve the global industry demand for international business graduates, has set a trend towards establishing cross border partnerships amongst universities and schools to facilitate student and faculty exchange. Business schools globally have expanded their networks to incorporate international perspectives into learning experiences through cross cultural exposure and global immersion programs. To generate research insights about trends and best practices in global management of enterprises and markets, joint research amongst faculty has been promoted by most schools.

Cultural diversity is very much valued by the schools which focus on preparing students for doing business with global impact. Academic collaborations for student and faculty exchange, multi-country campuses and multi-location programs have allowed seamless international education experience. Student exchange programs have been effective in experiential learning through immersion in the local culture, appreciation for the history of the region and the regional business landscape. Peer learning in a class represented by students from multiple countries is instrumental in expanding mental horizons and increasing creativity amongst the students. Dual degree programs delivered by partner business schools are becoming popular amongst students who would like to experience the diversity of cultures and economies. Ability to leverage diverse cultures and practices in pursuit of innovation and continuous improvement should be an important outcome of an effective management education process.

Business schools also need to be seen as drivers of globalization as they advocate the benefits of globalization while elucidating the negative effects for timely consideration. During times when international powers continue to shift; discontinuities, shocks, and surprises are common across industries; and right winged politics leans toward protectionism, it is the business schools that shall play an important role in providing the kaleidoscopic view of the changing future and ability to think through diverse scenarios. Management education should be able to prepare the graduating students to have a global perspective to perform competently and delve in global issues.

Providing access to management education in countries and regions still struggling with developmental challenges is an important responsibility business schools will need to undertake to satisfy the talent needs. Economic growth of underdeveloped regions depends greatly on sufficient investment in management education. National regulations or policy for higher learning therefore needs to provide the business schools flexibility and the autonomy to accommodate the required changes in the curricula, redefine the form of alliances with global business schools, and the ability to move beyond borders. There is lot to achieve towards effective borderless management education through collaborations and exporting management education."

To explore the vicinity's villages - Sonapur, Dabul and Cavel - I dive into the Dickensian alleys of Sonapur, earlier cemetery turf, around Our Lady of Dolours Church. A colourful first stop is Wellington Terrace on the street saluting physician-mayor Simon Fernandes. Sniffing curry on the boil, I meet residents who miss neighbours moved to Orlem and Borivli. ""This colony was packed, people slept in landing corridors,"" recalls engineer Simon Lobo. ""Till the 1970s our wadi hosted Republic Day dances on a wooden floor and Church held Latin masses.""

They settled satellite-like around Bhuleshwar, site of the cathedral whose later avatar was Colaba's Holy Name Cathedral.

Band bops sounded daylong from Chris' home, facing 148-year-old Saint Francis Xavier Church with a mismatched 344-year-old bell. Cast in 1674 by Hiram Tavarres Bocarro, this seventh bell of St Joseph's Church, Bassein, fell silent with the Maratha siege in 1739. The British procured it from the subdued Portuguese and the bell then tolled for over a century in St Thomas Cathedral. Journeying to the Bombay Arsenal, the sole war survivor bell was gifted in 1883 to Dabul thanks to the Portuguese Vicar General of the North.

A member of the Constituent Assembly representing Bombay to write the Constitution of India, he was among the free nation's first MPs. His son, Dr Joseph Leon D'Souza, the 1967 mayor, was the first Goan in the Maharashtra cabinet, appointed State Minister for Health and Protocol.

""Small things spelt excitement - vendors trundling in from Vasai on bullock carts with watermelons and strung onions, the lovely yellow carpet of dry flowers our compound datura shed in May,"" says Myrna.

""In a democracy, people are supreme. Governance should be according to people...but Delhi is deprived of it. In Delhi, governments have been elected since 1993 but they have had few powers.

Slamming the LG's decision to reduce the size of a school plot from 4,000 sq meter to 1,500, he called it a fraud on the people of Delhi. ""The education minister who is popular for his work has no power to decide where to open a school.""

He also said ""the land of a school was used to build the BJP office by changing its land use"", but DDA hadn't given land to the AAP government for building hospitals in the past four years.

In early January 2019, economists and social scientists will jostle at the annual American Economic and Social Science Association meetings in Atlanta as academic departments globally will try to recruit freshly minted doctoral students for tenure track and tenured positions as well. They will however have new competition from big data firms like Facebook, Amazon and Uber who are also going to be there to recruit PhDs. And the tension that academia may lose well-trained young minds from their university garages is already palpable.

In doing so, big data may not just be the new oil but also the new robber barons, stealing PhDs from academia in the global labour market. Or so it seems is the feeling of several North American university academicians in recent conversations of this author with them. On econ-twitter, an economist colleague tweeted recently that ""PhDs who end up working outside the academy are not failures, enough already with professional elitism"", but such a view seems a minority. The rise of technology firms, generating click-stream data in platforms by the minute has created new markets and ways of acquiring information, where digital economists now are increasingly playing an important role in design, strategy, pricing, and dealing with regulation.

In a 2018 paper, Stanford and Harvard economists Susan Athey and Michael Luca point exactly to this. As they document, North American job postings from technology firms for economists with a PhD increased to 21 in the 2017-2018 cycle from 15 just four years earlier, while economics departments saw during the same period, a fall in postings from 232 to 194. While the numbers are still not threatening, the skills that economists bring to technology firms (including assessing causal empirical relationships besides analysing equilibrium market structure) offer value that are difficult to ignore. To add to it, digital economists in their daily jobs can also offer econometric advice and troubleshoot on design of online advertising, provide statistical intuition behind ranking, reviews and returns from advertising apart from helping out policy teams of firms in understanding market structure, thereby anticipating and dealing with regulatory effects on firm competitive advantage. As a senior academic quipped, universities train PhDs in economics and social sciences for 5 to 6 years spending millions of dollars (factoring in tuition waiver, health insurance, a stipend in graduate school along with faculty time and salaries) and then these new 'robber barons are stealing them away with 6 figure salaries'.

To be sure, such a quibble may be incomplete. If positions in economics are declining and faculty getting tenure upstream is also on the downtrend (besides witnessing the rise of new positions in North American universities of associate professors without tenure), one can only expect rational agents (in these cases, PhD students) planning their way out apriori from the academy into more lucrative industry options. The job can be fun too, some firms allowing data scientists to write papers building on their daily troubleshooting work.

All that said, one can expect some course corrections too going forward in the formal PhD labour market. First, universities can be expected to raise their graduate student stipends and fellowships to attract more students in the doctoral life, especially if the effect of the robber barons is going to spill over downstream with lesser number of students entering the field per se. Second, universities can also be expected to enforce contractual obligations in the doctoral programmes ensuring that graduate students after finishing their PhD need necessarily continue in academia for couple more years, to make sure that some of the investments on graduate doctoral training indeed witness private as well as social returns. In addition, technology firms in responding competitively, may end up creating their own internal universities where bachelors and masters students can be offered training on the job in the same skills that a university trained PhD economist may come with, this in preparation for a supply gap that may emerge. Also, one can also expect a more concerted shift in the academic curriculum of what traditional economics and public policy PhD programmes offer in universities globally. Finally, one can also expect welfare losses from PhDs in other disciplines (like say in mechanical or civil engineering or mathematics and physics) turning data scientists for the new age technology firms. Many of these are already happening but equilibrium outcomes for each would be interesting to keep an eye out for in the future.

This apart, one can also expect international ramifications with doctoral students from emerging economies providing an alternate labour pool for technology firms for the requisite skills, though, if that happens, what will be the implication of that for basic research, postdoctoral work and doctoral studies in emerging economy universities remains to be seen. In addition, there could also be creation of new immigration visa categories by countries not just in North America but also in other central locations of big-data work (like China and India) to accommodate these digital social scientists. Finally, the geographic location of such work could change if digital social scientists are cheaper to purchase in international locations like in Pune or Bangalore, India or Shenzhen, China.

Overall, these are interesting times coming from unintended consequences of the maturing of big-data firms in the global labour markets of PhDs. Early economists who toggled their lives between universities and technology firms (like Steve Tadelis of EBay and Amazon or Google's Hal Varian - both noted UC Berkeley professors, or Susan Athey of Stanford University who has worked with Microsoft), may have shown the way, but the digital industrial wave in the market for PhDs in economics, social and physical sciences both in the global north and south is far from over."
"559","1019526299","2018-12-16","https://swarajyamag.com/ideas/time-for-a-new-generation-of-scholars-to-study-savarkar","Time For A New Generation Of Scholars To Study Savarkar ","swarajyamag.com",FALSE,"Current debates about Savarkar are often based on flimsy grounds, and he is caricatured by both the left and right for partisan reasons.

Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was freed from internal exile in May 1937. Twenty-seven long years had passed since he had been illegally arrested by the British police on French soil in March 1910. These years out in the cold included a decade of intense suffering in the brutal Cellular Jail in the Andamans. Savarkar was then shifted to Ratnagiri on the condition that he would not take part in any political activity. His final release was widely welcomed. There was a lot of interest about his next move. Two young socialist leaders, S. M. Joshi and Achyut Patwardhan, who would later become heroes of the 1942 underground movement, even went to Ratnagiri to persuade Savarkar to join the Congress Socialist Party.

Savarkar reached Mumbai a few days after he became a free man. The public meeting organised in his honour was led by an eclectic group of leaders from the city. There was Jamnadas Mehta, a follower of Lokmanya Tilak, a member of the Democratic Swaraj Party, and the man who had led the campaign to free Savarkar. There was Comrade M. N. Roy, who had once worked with Lenin in Moscow, and had emerged a few months earlier from his own incarceration. There was Senapati Bapat, who was a member of the revolutionary group founded by Savarkar in London, and who had by then moved into the Gandhian camp, as had the late V. V. S. Aiyar, another old comrade from the India House days. There was Khurshed F. Nariman, the lawyer who was recently the Congress mayor of Bombay, and a steadfast admirer of Savarkar. There was Lalji Pendse, the Marxist intellectual and independent trade union leader.

This was a generation whose lives had been electrified by the example set by Savarkar in his early years. In his speech that day, Savarkar assured his admirers that he would be with them in the struggle for Indian independence. He then said he agreed with the socialists that people should be freed from the clutches of religion; what he disagreed with was the attempt to undermine the rights of one religious community to satisfy another religious community. He told the audience that his final goal was a united Indian nation where each citizen had equal civil and political rights. Savarkar also said that his struggle against untouchability was a complement to the wider socialist struggle, and that the Left should realise that oppression is not always just an economic issue. He then gave the examples of B. R. Ambedkar and N. S. Kajrolkar, who had to deal with untouchability despite not being poor. These broad themes -- of protecting Hindu interests, building a modern nation state and fighting caste oppression -- would continue to feature in his speeches after he plunged back into national politics as president of the Hindu Mahasabha.

There is one charming episode from around this time that throws more light on the admiration that even political rivals had for Savarkar. In his autobiography, the film maker J. B. H. Wadia has recounted how M. N. Roy, who usually preferred Western clothes, once arrived at the breakfast table in the Wadia home dressed in a white dhoti-kurta. Roy explained to his puzzled host: ""I am going to pay my respects to Veer Savarkar and I thought I should do it in the fittest manner possible. I am sure the old man will be pleased to see me dressed as a full-fledged Indian rather than as a Westernized revolutionary.""

Such a warm reception for Savarkar from across the political spectrum seems almost unbelievable today. He is now an enigma to most people. It is unfortunate that not enough is known about Savarkar, despite all the noise surrounding his name -- ""a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing"". One important reason is that most of his own writing is in his native Marathi. The few who have dipped into the Savarkar literature have restricted themselves to Essentials of Hindutva, arguably one of his weakest works, though also the most influential.

The other reason for the veil of ignorance is that both his supporters as well as detractors have preferred to cherry pick what suits their political agendas. The former prefer to remember Savarkar for his astonishing escape bid at Marseilles harbour or the harrowing punishments he had to face in the Cellular Jail or his intense dislike for the Muslim politics of his day. The latter prefer to focus on his mercy pleas to the colonial government or his possible involvement in the Gandhi murder conspiracy.

The man who even his political rivals once respected has thus been lost in a fog of either hagiography or demonisation. Savarkar deserves better. He was a Hindu nationalist who attracted the ire of religious conservatives for his merciless attacks on social traditions; he was a Mazzini liberal who had a fascination for military power; he wrote about the historical divide between the two main religious communities, agreeing with Jinnah that these were two nations, but hoped to unite them under a common democratic Hindustani nation state; he took a hard line against the Muslim politics of his day but had read the Quran as well as tried his hand at writing Urdu poetry; he was an avid student of history who believed that India has to move forward into the age of science rather than seek inspiration from religious texts. This essay tries to provide some vignettes of Savarkar that will hopefully lead to more rational debate about him as a public figure.

Sceptics may reasonably wonder whether the widespread admiration for Savarkar recounted earlier came when there was a high tide of public sympathy just after his release, and that the tide later receded. That is not so. One of the political groups that Savarkar collaborated with in the years before independence were the Indian liberals led by Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru. He was invited to some of their meetings well after the initial euphoria following his release had petered out. The philosopher of armed revolution actually worked in tandem with the constitutionalists for some time.

In one of the annual conferences of the Indian Liberal Federation, the veteran liberal V. S. Srinivasa Sastri gave an interesting insight into Savarkar: ""I wish to say a word about Mr. Savarkar personally ... I had expected to see a gentleman perverse and obstinate and loud. But what did I find? I found a somewhat thin-looking, quiet Maharashtra chap, speaking slowly and deliberately, seldom raising his voice, but always apparently in full possession of his mind and knowing exactly what he wanted. I was still more surprised that in his talk all that day there was nothing to remind me of his unparalleled experiences. Those who know anything about Mr. Savarkar know that his life has been marked by the greatest hardships and a considerable amount of what he would think was undeserved persecution. He was for many days in absolute danger of his life and passed through concealment and flight several times over before he found safety. Even after all this I was, as I said, agreeably surprised to find no note of bitterness in his speech, nothing certainly anti-Government, nothing anti-British. I at once conceived a great admiration of the man ...""

This was followed by another mention in a speech by R. P. Paranjape, the brilliant mathematician who was the principal of Ferguson College in Pune when Savarkar had to face disciplinary action as a student for his political activity: ""People know a great deal about Mr. Savarkar and Mr. Sastri has spoken to you his impressions of him. My own acquaintance with Mr. Savarkar goes a long way, about forty years back, when he was a student under me in College, while I was a Principal. I had occasion then to take certain disciplinary steps against him, and to a certain extent I claim to know something of the life of Mr. Savarkar. All the same on this occasion he has behaved as a real self-respecting and patriotic person should. One should not judge of Mr. Savarkar from simple newspaper reports. He bears me no grudge and I bear him no grudge for anything that happened in his life some forty years ago. As a matter of fact, when about a few years ago I first saw him after his release, he felt as a pupil meeting his old Guru. And in recent times his attitude on various public questions has been such as every liberal here can almost fully endorse.""

Here were the true disciples of Gopal Krishna Gokhale heaping praise on Savarkar. It is interesting that he too had similar affection for their master. Savarkar was from the Tilak school of politics, and yet he recounted in his book on his years in the Andamans how he broke down when he was told that the Gokhale, the main rival to Tilak in the Congress, had died. His surprised jailor asked Savarkar why he was crying at the death of an enemy. ""We had differences but we were not enemies. He was one of the best products of our age, and an undaunted patriot and a sincere servant of India,"" Savarkar replied. Savarkar would tell his followers in the revolutionary camp that they should aspire to match the deep learning of moderates such as Gokhale and R. C. Dutt.

Savarkar continued to have admirers from different political persuasions even after he was acquitted in the Gandhi murder trial, a far cry from his political untouchability today. In May 1952, Savarkar was in Pune to dissolve Abhinav Bharat, the revolutionary society he had set up many decades ago to fight for Indian freedom. In his speech on the occasion, which remains relevant even today, Savarkar explained that revolutionary organisations such as Abhinav Bharat have no place in a constitutional republic, and that anarchy would otherwise be a threat to national stability. He added that opposition parties -- be they in the Hindutva or communist camps -- should respect the fact that the Indian people have handed the task of running the government of free India to the Congress party. It was the duty of all citizens to support the elected national government, even as they had the right to criticise it.

Among the people on the stage with Savarkar that day were Senapati Bapat, Keshavrao Jedhe of the Peasants and Workers Party, and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief M. S. Golwalkar. A few years later, in May 1958, Savarkar was felicitated by the Greater Bombay Municipal Corporation to mark his seventy-fifth birthday. The felicitation was chaired by the mayor of Bombay, Comrade S. S. Mirajkar of the Communist Party of India, an unthinkable event today. A few years earlier, Asaf Ali had described his old India House comrade Savarkar as someone who lived in the spirit of Mazzini and Shivaji, which was apt considering the fact that the Italian revolutionary and the great Maratha king were his political heroes.

Savarkar died in 26 February 1966. His body was burnt in the electric crematorium in Mumbai because the atheist did not want any religious rites performed. Among those who paid their last respects to the departed revolutionary were several distinguished Mumbai citizens, including Comrade S. A. Dange. The Marathi magazine Satyakatha, the voice of the literary establishment of the day, had a special section on Savarkar in its May 1966 issue. Marathi writers of the stature of V. V. Shirwadkar ""Kusumagraj"" -- who was later to win the Jnanpith Award in 1987 -- paid tributes to him in that issue. The great Marathi poet described Savarkar as a modern Prometheus, who stole fire from the Gods to bring light to humanity, and who was made to suffer for his selfless act. The historian Y. D. Phadke wrote a more critical piece on Savarkar in the same issue. Meanwhile, Acharya P. K. Atre wrote 14 special editorials on Savarkar in his newspaper over the next fortnight. Two days after Savarkar died, Comrade Hiren Mukherjee of the Communist Party of India stood up in the Lok Sabha to demand that parliament pay homage to Savarkar. Dange described him there as a great anti-imperialist revolutionary while Indira Gandhi said Savarkar was a byword in daring and patriotism.

The point of repeating all these examples is to show that Savarkar had admirers from all walks of life till the very end of his life. At the same time, as in the case of his reaction to the death of Gokhale, Savarkar too could offer personal support to the very rivals whom he bitterly lashed out against in political battles, in a sense reciprocating what he experienced from those who often opposed him politically. For example, in 1940, he issued a statement after Jawaharlal Nehru was sentenced to four years in jail. ""The news of the sentence of four years imprisonment passed on Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru must have come as a painful shock to every Indian patriot. Inspite of differences as to principles and policy which compel both of us to work under different colours, I shall be failing in my duty as a Hindu Sabhite if I do not express my deep appreciation of the patriotic and even the humanitarian motives which had actuated Pandit Jawaharlalji throughout his public career and my sympathy for the sufferings which he has consequently had to face.""

In 1943, Savarkar was part of the All-Party Conference led by the Allahabad liberal Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru when he publicly called upon Gandhi to end his fast because it was important ""to leave no stone unturned to save his precious life"". Savarkar was also among several leaders such as B. R. Ambedkar, M. N. Roy and Rajaji who stayed away from the 1942 Quit India movement. Each had his own reason. Savarkar had called on Hindu youth to join the army to acquire military skills. His reason was that nationalists should build their capabilities to prepare for the freedom that was inevitable at the end of the war, and that getting stuck in jail was a strategic error.

Yet, when the Congress leadership was arrested in August 1942, he spoke out for them. ""The inevitable has happened; the foremost and patriotic leaders of the Congress Party, including Mr Gandhi, are arrested and imprisoned; the personal sympathies of the Hindu Mahasabhites, and Hindus in general, go with them in their suffering for a patriotic cause,"" Savarkar said in a statement, though he also reiterated that his party would not support the Quit India resolution. He later lashed out at party workers who heckled Gandhi during a prayer meeting in New Delhi days before the assassination, calling their act undemocratic. In a public meeting in Pune, when Savarkar was heckled by young socialist students, he scolded them by saying that decency demands that they hear him out just as he would listen to them.

Savarkar was a political realist. The Hindu Mahasabha had vehemently opposed the partition of India in August 1947, but it was quick to extend support to the new national government, at a time when the socialists and communists had misread the transfer of power as a case of false freedom. The socialists had boycotted the celebrations while the communists were preparing for armed rebellion. In his biography of Savarkar, Dhananjay Keer noted that Savarkar encouraged Shyama Prasad Mukherjee to take up the offer to join the first government headed by Jawaharlal Nehru. Savarkar had petitioned the Constituent Assembly that the official flag of the new nation state should be the saffron one, but he hoisted the tricolour outside his Mumbai home on 15 August 1947, since that had been decided by the government of free India. He would later welcome the Constitution as well, and especially its abolition of untouchability.

Savarkar was an early supporter of the moving spirit of that constitution, B. R. Ambedkar. In her pioneering Ambedkar biography, the American scholar Elinor Zelliot writes that Savarkar backed the Dalit march led by Ambedkar in 1927 for access to the public tank in the town of Mahad, south of Mumbai. ""Support for the satyagraha came from a number of sources, among them Veer Savarkar, the revolutionary whose interest in the Depressed Classes may have stemmed from his desire for a stronger Hinduism, but whose support nevertheless was bold and unorthodox,"" she wrote.

This was at a time when Savarkar had focussed a lot of his energy on social reforms, and some of his provocative essays in Marathi magazines such as Kirloskar will shock even contemporary social conservatives. In one essay, on how two phrases define two cultures, he compared the Indian quest to seek solace in the past while the European nations prided themselves for their up-to-date knowledge of the world, from new technology to the cut of a suit.

He wrote in a Marathi essay, as translated by Mint newspaper: ""So, reformers who rock the boat, who become unpopular, who disturb the social balance, who hurt religious sentiments, who turn their back on majority opinion, who think rationally -- all these reformers face the inevitable consequences of their actions. Every reformer has had to face these challenges. This is because social reform -- by definition rooting out any evil social custom -- means taking on the persistent social beliefs of the majority."" The three reformers he specifically mentioned in his essay were Buddha, Jesus and Mohammad.

Savarkar would later invite Ambedkar to inaugurate the Patit Pavan temple in Ratnagiri, which was open to all castes. Ambedkar could not attend the inauguration because of his work load in Mumbai. The admiration for Ambedkar was transparent. In one of his essays on social reforms, Savarkar would pour scorn on a culture that believes it gets polluted with even the shadow of an Ambedkar but thinks it gets purified with cow urine; a culture that sees God in an animal but treats a Godlike person such as Ambedkar like an animal. In January 1942, when Ambedkar turned 50, Savarkar praised his ""personality, erudition and capacity to lead"" and said: ""The very fact of the birth of such a towering personality among the so-called untouchable castes could not but liberate their souls from self-depression and animate them to challenge the super-arrogant claims of the so-called touchables"".

Dhananjay Keer later wrote that the only three truly intellectual political leaders of that time were Ambedkar, Savarkar and Roy. However, Phadke argued in his 1966 essay that Savarkar was in fact quite unlike his contemporaries such as Gandhi, Nehru and Roy, who adapted their views as they learnt from experience. Savarkar remained rooted in the views that he embraced as a young man, falling prey to dogmatism. Ambedkar himself accused Gandhi of a similar flaw: ""In the age of Ranade leaders depended upon experience as a corrective method to their thoughts and their deeds. The leaders of the present age depend upon their inner voice as their guide.""

Savarkar was also an uncompromising modernist -- ""a child of Enlightenment rationalism,"" as the writer Pankaj Mishra, no fan of Hindu nationalism, has quite rightly pointed out. He strongly believed that India could be a successful nation state only if it embraced modern science, social equality, machinery and military power. His attacks on Hindu social practices were harsh enough for many religious organisations to pass resolutions condemning him. Savarkar welcomed the machine age as a way to liberate humankind from drudgery. Like many others in the Indian House group, Savarkar was deeply influenced by the utilitarian philosophy of Herbert Spencer, and had in an essay described Sri Krishna as the first utilitarian.

Savarkar was very clearly inspired by the ideals of European nationalism, especially the Italian Risorgimento. Like nationalists of every hue in that generation, the central question that Savarkar grappled with was how to integrate India into a territorial nation state, just as the Italians had done in 1860 and the Germans in 1871. Savarkar was famously galvanised by the example set by Joseph Mazzini, the revolutionary who helped integrate Italy into a united nation state. He was also an admirer of Kemal Ataturk, calling on Indian Muslims to learn from the Turkish example, and join the modern world rather than getting trapped in the pages of the Quran.

Another improbable person he had a high regard for was Lenin. Savarkar translated a Russian article on the revolutionary Soviet law giving women the right to choose their sexual partners as well as divorce their husbands. He never formally backed these ideas, but the very fact that he presented the translation for his readers to think over tells us a lot. In his Marathi memoirs, Narayan Sadashiv Bapat, once a member of Savarkar's inner circle at Ratnagiri, who later became a Royist, wrote how Savarkar would urge his colleagues to read Lenin. Some lectures on Lenin were given by a young Nathuram Godse, who later committed the heinous crime of killing Gandhi, an act that put Savarkar in the dock. The scholar D. N. Gokhale writes in his Marathi book on Savarkar about how a meeting had been held at Savarkar's house in Ratnagiri to discuss the Lenin biography written by Godse (a book that this writer has for long tried to find). Bapat also remembers that the Savarkar brothers, in their newspaper, passionately defended the communists accused in the Meerut Conspiracy Case.

Soon after he was released from internal exile, Savarkar was elected to preside over the prestigious annual Marathi Sahitya Sammelan in Mumbai. He welcomed newer Marxist and Freudian approaches to literature, but also added that reducing literature to only economic or sexual explanations severely limits its scope. The second half of the speech was incendiary -- an incredible call to writers to put down their pens to pick up the gun, because their artistic freedom could only be protected under the umbrella of effective national security. Savarkar had touched upon a similar dilemma in one of his Marathi plays, where a young warrior tells Gautam Buddha that he too dreams of a world where poets rule, but he has to pick up the sword to defend his country till there are others in the world who do not follow the Tathagata's message of peace.

That speech at the literary conference is one example of how Savarkar's love of rhetoric could overcome his love of reason. As Janaki Bakhale of Columbia University perceptively notes in a recent essay on Savarkar: ""Both Mazzini and Savarkar saw themselves as literary figures and succeeded more in the realm of writing than in politics. Neither was a systematic thinker. Both were cosmopolitan nationalists, stipulating that the nation should be based more on a common political project than on ethnicity, religion, culture, or language"".

In a review of Hindu Pad Padshahi published in the May 1926 issue of the Modern Review, the historian Jadunath Sarkar pointed out that Savarkar's work on the Maratha rebellion against Muslim rule was an example of romantic rather than professional history writing. In a Marathi essay on the social reformer and writer Prabodhankar Thackeray -- father of Bal Thackeray -- the historian Y. D. Phadke mentions how the former would joke about the Savarkar style of history writing. However, Savarkar wrote to light the spark of armed revolution against British Rule rather than as a detached academic calmly balancing evidence. Another famous historian, R. C. Majumdar, wrote the introduction to Hindu Pad Padshahi.

The opening remarks made by Savarkar in this book give us some insight into his views on the communal question, which is where he most strongly departed from the mainstream of Indian nationalism as well as attracting the ire of generations of critics. It is well known that Savarkar was a relentless critic of the Muslim politics of his time, as well as the attempts by the Gandhian Congress to accommodate its demands. Savarkar asked during his presidential speech of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1937: ""Are the Mohammedans ready to join ... a truly national Indian State without asking any special privilege, protection or weightage on the fanatical ground that a special merit attaches to them of being Mohammedans and not Hindus?""

Savarkar argued that Hindus would be committing political suicide by abandoning their identity as long as Muslims refused to give up their identity as a separate people. There was no common ground for an integral nationalism, a position that Ambedkar too took in his writings on the partition of India. Savarkar's key political point during these years was that the demand put forth during the constitutional negotiations in the last decades of British rule -- that the Hindu and Muslim communities should have equal seats in a future parliament -- in effect gave every Muslim citizen two votes while every Hindu citizen had just one vote. Savarkar was furious that this contradicted the key democratic principle that each person should have one vote.

However, he repeatedly said his final goal was not just a secular Indian State but a world commonwealth where human beings lived as human beings. He enigmatically ended The Essentials of Hindutva with the following statement: ""A Hindu is most intensively so when he ceases to be a Hindu; and with a Shankar claims the whole Earth for a Benaras"".

Savarkar saw the central theme of medieval Indian history as a heroic Hindu rebellion against Muslim domination, led by men such as Prithviraj Chauhan, Rana Pratap, Shivaji Maharaj and Guru Teg Bahadur. Yet, Savarkar also argued in the opening pages of Hindu Pad Padshahi that it is the task of modern societies to overcome the strife of the past. One paragraph is especially resonant: ""Especially our Muhammadan countrymen, against the deeds of whose ancestors the history under review was a giant and mighty protest, which we hold justifiable, will try to read (this book) without attributing, solely on that ground, any ill feeling by us towards our Muhammadan countrymen of this generation, or towards the community itself as such. It would be as suicidal and as ridiculous to borrow the hostilities and combats of the past only to fight them out into the present, as it would be for a Hindu and a Muhammadan to lock each other suddenly in a death grip while embracing, only because Shivaji and Afzul Khan had done so, hundreds of years ago."" He added that people should read history not to perpetuate the old strife but to seek a way out of it by identifying the causes of such strife.

However, Savarkar tied himself in a knot on this central issue of his politics. He was a passionate defender of Hindu political rights. He wrote incessantly about the clash between the two communities over centuries. He said that Hindus and Muslims are two nations, or two separate people. Yet, he also argued for a secular democratic state where both communities would live in peace, without convincingly explaining how the circle would be squared. (Savarkar used the word nation in the contemporary sense of a people rather than in the modern sense of a nation state.)

In a perceptive analysis, Ambedkar pointed out the fundamental contradiction in Savarkar's quest to force two warring communities to live together in a common nation state, rather than accept partition. After complimenting Savarkar for his clarity as compared to the vagueness of Congress policy, Ambedkar wrote: ""It must be said that Mr. Savarkar's attitude is illogical, if not queer. Mr. Savarkar admits that the Muslims are a separate nation. He concedes that they have a right to cultural autonomy. He allows them to have a national flag. Yet he opposes the demand of the Muslim nation for a separate national home. If he claims a national home for the Hindu nation, how can he refuse the claim of the Muslim nation for a national home?""

The parallels between Savarkar and the Zionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, the father figure of the Israeli Right, are striking. What Jabotinsky wrote in the very beginning of his famous political tract, The Iron Wall, is very close to the Savarkarite view: ""Emotionally, my attitude to the Arabs is the same as to all other nations -- polite indifference. Politically, my attitude is determined by two principles. First of all, I consider it utterly impossible to eject the Arabs from Palestine. There will always be two nations in Palestine - which is good enough for me, provided the Jews become the majority. And secondly, I belong to the group that once drew up the Helsingfors Programme , the programme of national rights for all nationalities living in the same State. In drawing up that programme, we had in mind not only the Jews, but all nations everywhere, and its basis is equality of rights.""

""I am prepared to take an oath binding ourselves and our descendants that we shall never do anything contrary to the principle of equal rights, and that we shall never try to eject anyone. This seems to me a fairly peaceful credo. But it is quite another question whether it is always possible to realise a peaceful aim by peaceful means. For the answer to this question does not depends on our attitudes to the Arabs, but entirely on the attitude of the Arabs to us and to Zionism.""

Savarkar had a similar political programme, with the same internal tensions. These comments in the course of his presidential speech at the Calcutta meeting of the Hindu Mahasabha in 1939 are perhaps the clearest indication of what Savarkar meant: ""The Hindu Sanghanists Party aims to base the future constitution of Hindustan on the broad principle that all citizens should have equal rights and obligations irrespective of caste or creed, race or religion, provided they avow and owe an exclusive and devoted allegiance to the Hindustani State. The fundamental rights of liberty of speech, liberty of conscience, of worship, of association, etc., will be enjoyed by all citizens alike. Whatever restrictions will be imposed on them in the interest of the public peace and order of National emergency will not be based on any religious or racial considerations alone but on common National grounds.""

""No attitude can be more National even in the territorial sense than this and it is this attitude in general which is expressed in substance by the curt formula 'one man one vote'. This will make it clear that the conception of a Hindu Nation is in no way inconsistent with the development of a common Indian Nation, a united Hindustani State in which all sects and sections, races and religions, castes and creeds, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Anglo-Indians, etc., could be harmoniously welded together into a political State on terms of perfect equality.""

""But as practical politics require it, and as the Hindu Sanghanists want to relieve our non-Hindu countrymen of even a ghost of suspicion, we are prepared to emphasise that the legitimate rights of minorities with regard to their religion, culture and language will be expressly guaranteed: on one condition only that the equal rights of the majority also must not in any case be encroached upon or abrogated. Every minority may have separate schools to train up their children in their own tongue, their own religious or cultural institutions and can receive Government help also for these, but always in proportion to the taxes they pay into the common Exchequer. The same principle must, of course, hold good in case of the majority too.""

In an essay in the New York Times, the Israeli historian Avi Shlaim wrote that Jabotinsky was banking on the fact that Zionist determination would break the Palestinian national movement of the day, creating space for moderate Arab opinion to emerge, in turn creating opportunities for serious negotiations between the two communities. Is that what Savarkar also wished? It is hard to know.

Savarkar inevitably spoke in favour of political liberty, modernity, social reforms and industrial development. However, his burning passion was a strong nation state. Savarkar often argued that an effective democracy has to be backed by military power; he once wrote that swords and cannons define the boundaries and rights of states. A tricky question worth pondering over is whether Savarkar saw democracy as a building block of a strong Indian nation state or as a requirement in itself for citizens (as was the case with Ambedkar).

In a speech in 1961, as part of a Mrutyunjay Divas celebration in Pune, Savarkar argued he would prefer a strong dictatorship that is able to protect Indian interests to a weak democracy that is unable to do so. This was in contrast to his usual defence of liberty, a strange outburst by the lion in winter. Among the leaders he mentioned to bolster his case for military strength were Hitler, Lenin, Stalin, De Gaulle and, hold your breath, Mobutu Sese Seko of the Congo. He was also careful to add -- echoing Mazzini -- that the citizens of a strong nation would also eventually overthrow such dictators, as was the case with Napoleon.

This essay began with the excitement unleashed after Savarkar was released from internal exile. His subsequent political career was not very successful. One challenge was that he was at the head of a smaller party that did not have the organisational strength of the Congress. An equally important point that often comes up in Marathi writing on Savarkar is that he had become too much of a loner in his later years, even refusing to meet his old India House friend Mirza Abbas when he visited Mumbai in 1950. There was a tinge of bitterness of well, and it is worth speculating whether this was related either to the physical torture he had to experience in Cellular Jail or the fact that he had been overshadowed in national politics by Gandhi. Some of his London comrades said they missed the signature laughter that echoed through the rooms of India House in the old days.

Savarkar eventually failed to build an organisation to further his political programme. Keer writes that Savarkar could never nurture Shyama Prasad Mukherjee the way Gandhi nurtured Nehru. Others have speculated whether the style of leadership that Savarkar perfected while leading a revolutionary group was inadequate for an electoral party such as the Hindu Mahasabha, where the focus had to be building a mass base rather than individual acts of daring.

The stormy petrel of early 20th century Indian politics could never occupy the centre stage after his final release from incarceration. The socialist intellectual Narahar Kurundkar wrote in a Marathi essay that younger political activists who could have joined Savarkar had already been pulled into the Gandhian movement by 1937, while Savarkar was left in the company of older traditionalists who were incapable of appreciating his deeper political programme. That, says Kurundkar, was one of the grand tragedies of Indian politics.

Savarkar will always be a controversial figure, but there is no doubt this brilliant revolutionary needs to be understood better. The current debates about him are often based on flimsy grounds, and he is caricatured by both sides for partisan reasons. The time is ripe for a new generation of scholars to grapple with the Savarkar enigma."

"561","1019510170","2018-12-16","https://indianexpress.com/article/express-sunday-eye/in-search-of-lost-time-4-5494316/","Exploring the stories, legends, and myths of Lahore","The Indian Express",FALSE,"My maternal grandmother, Amrit Bery, was a Lahori; her family hailed from Shah Almi Gate, the beating heart of the old Walled City -- androon shehr. Her father, Narain Das Bery, was a lawyer and she and her sisters had been educated at the Sacred Heart Convent School, until the family was forced to migrate to India in 1947. I never met my grandmother, but it was from her sister, Jiwan, that I learnt of the enchanting city of their birth. Being a scholar of the 1947 Partition, this knowledge has since been enhanced through oral histories of others who once lived there. In an interview with professor Sat Pal Kohli of the Delhi College of Art, I was told that ""situated on the banks of the river Ravi, Lahore was founded by Luv or Loh, one of the twin sons of Lord Rama. The very word 'Lahore' means the fort of Loh. It is the city of gardens, of sin and splendour, of Rudyard Kipling and Amrita Pritam. The city of my birth, separated from me now by a border, by wars, by religion and by time. That is Lahore.""

I have since had the chance to travel across the border several times, and, on each visit, my endeavour has been to unearth yet another layer to the life Amrit Bery might have lived as a young girl, and, in the course of doing so, it seems that Lahore has unsurprisingly embedded itself deep into my heart. For a Dilliwali, Lahore seems a splitting image of home -- the warmth and Punjabiyat of the people, the Mughal forts, the colonial monuments, the bustling bazaars and broad, tree-lined roads boast of the similarity between the two cities. And, despite the fact that Lahore is Pakistani and Delhi is Indian, there are moments when one does, as I have several times, felt as though it was possible to slip into the crevasses of shared history and culture of the once undivided India.

""The area we lived in was called Machhi Hatta, but I don't remember the lane any more,"" my grandaunt told me. She went on to describe the imposing Shah Almi Gate, which she remembered to be nearby, one of the 13 darwazas -- Roshnai, Kashmiri, Masti, Khizri or Sheranwala, Yakki, Delhi, Akbari, Mochi, Shah Almi, Lohari, Mori, Bhatti, Taxali -- of which now only six remain. Though she described their house in great detail (four-storey, five-six steps leading to the entrance, the middle house in a row of three, overlooking a large stepwell-cum-bathing spot), the actual location was hazy. It would be difficult to find, but on my most recent visit in February, I set off with these details nonetheless.

It turned out that history had not been kind to my grandmother's neighbourhood. Shah Almi darwaza existed no more; it had been consumed in a terrible fire during the riots of 1947, along with the Hindu and Sikh residents of the area. Smoke had risen from the ashen mohallah for day after. Today, in lieu of the once-dominating Mughal Gate, hang lengths of electrical wires, mirroring the aerial landscape one can find in Delhi's Chandni Chowk.

Walking deeper into the Walled City made me notice other things, nuances that situate Lahore within a curiously syncretic antiquity. Across Circular Road at Chowk Shah Alam, there stands the famed One Night Mosque (Aik Raat Ki Masjid), a white, double-storey structure with small minarets and latticework balconies, erected apparently in one night in 1922, after a tussle between the Hindi and Muslim communities to construct a place of worship in the same location. It is celebrated today due to a couplet on the incident by the poet Iqbal, ""Masjid toh bana di shab bhar mein iman ki hararat walon ne/ Mann apna purana papi hai, barson mein namazi ban na saka (Though the mosque was built overnight by the believers/ Our hearts are old sinners, they could not become devout over the years).

Walking further along, in awe of the history in every brick around me, manoeuvering my way through intricately carved, now dusty, wooden jharokhas and doors, unable to read Urdu signs well enough, asking people for directions and nodding time and again at the ""Aap India se hain?"" questions, I peered carefully at the names of lanes and streets, looking for clues and a sense of belonging.

Until 1947, the Walled City had well-defined domestic territories for ethnic groups, represented by the physical structure of the city itself. The outlying spine (guzars) gave way to the neighbourhoods (mohallas, kuchas), and, finally, the streets and bylanes (gallis). To understand the web of community history, one need only pay attention to the names of these winding, vein-like pathways -- Kucha Telian, Kucha Kababian, Galli Dhobian, Galli Ghunghroo Sazaan, Galli Bandooq Sazaan; some are named after well-known personalities like Galli Billa Kabootar Baaz, Sheeda Halwai Wali Galli, Kucha Faqir Khana, Kucha Aurangzeb; and, finally, they are named after the notable havelis in the area, like Pathhar Wali Haveli Galli.

But not all of Lahore boasts of this kind of alchemy; some parts speak directly to the disastrous traces that still remain of the communal riots of 1947. At the corner of Shah Almi Road and Rang Mahal Chowk, a sole building, half-burnt, still stands bearing the words, 'Gobind Ram Kahan Chand, Estd. 1805, Hindustan Commercial Bank'. The story goes that Gobind Ram, trader of achar, chutneys and sherbets, owned a shop on the ground floor of this building, and was also amongst the partners of this branch of the bank, which had been newly constructed at the time. Over the years, a myth has also been spun around the existence of a trench in the basement leading directly to the Lahore Fort.

Another gem I have returned to time and again, near Delhi Gate, is the historic Wazir Khan Mosque, built between 1635 and 1640 AD by Hakim Ilm ud Din, the prime minister of Emperor Shah Jahan. Fitted with the most beautiful fire-red brick and kasha tiles, frescos painted in hues of yellow, orange and green, the mosque is an oasis within an otherwise chaotic, bustling city. In an October 1, 1887 dispatch in the Civil and Military Gazette, Kipling, ever the Lahori, wrote that the area of the mosque was ""full of beauty even when the noonday heat silences the voices of men and puts the pigeons of the mosque to sleep.""

Inside the mosque, on either side of its octagonal entrance chamber, lies the Calligrapher's Bazaar -- 16 cloisters or hujras, eight on either side. These were originally earmarked as the studios of select master calligraphers, who worked on Quranic inscriptions and Persian verses that embellish the interior and exterior of the mosque. After the construction of the mosque was over, successive generations of these master calligraphers continued their trade and teachings from their hujras till the advent of the printing press in the city.

And, if we have mentioned Kipling -- a difficult thing not to do while speaking about Lahore -- it is only fair to mention Kim's Gun, the bore canon Zam-Zamah, that today rests in front of the Lahore Museum of the Mall, cast in 1762 under the Durrani Empire. Folklore states that once known to be the biggest cannon of the subcontinent at 14 ft 4.5 inches, its construction was funded by the people of Lahore, who donated their copper and brass kitchen utensils for the cause.

Stories, legends, and myths encircle the city of Lahore like close companions; its tales are endless, as are the evidences of the many rulers it has seen. Like any city of its age, it is a place where the past and present often meet in a disjointed but seemingly harmonious way. Its legacy and architecture is -- all at once -- Hindu, Mughal, Persian, Sikh and British.
