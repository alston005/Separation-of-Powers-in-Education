""The picnic comprising of 105 students of Jawahar Shishuvihar Vidyalaya had come to Diu on Friday. Koradia and Rathod along with some of their schoolmates had gone into the sea at Nagoa beach.

The DI was suspended following the death of two youths in a clash between the police and a mob in front of Daribhit High School in North Dinajpur on September 20.

A department official said on Sunday,

The suspension was withdrawn on Thursday and Mondal was given posting at Bikash Bhavan, the headquarters of the School Education Department here.

Mondal had been suspended after the deaths of Tapas Barman and Rajesh Sarkar, two former students of the high school, during the clash over appointment of two teachers of Urdu and Sanskrit, which was resented by students of the school as they wanted English teachers.

At a press meet after the incident, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee had said the DI was being suspended with immediate effect as he failed to understand the gravity of the situation beforehand and could not communicate to the higher authorities about the urgency in recruitment of English teachers in the school.

Mondal had, however, pleaded innocence saying the appointment of teachers was done by the school education department and not him.

The official said Mondal had replied to the showcause notice issued to him after suspension and after considering all factors, the suspension was withdrawn.

He will join the new office in January.

According to a representation submitted by the forum, members stated that although the case was transferred to the CBCID in 2013, action against the teachers is still pending. While the CID had sought clarification from the University Grants Commission to ascertain competence of certificates submitted by the teachers, officials from the forum have termed it a ""clear case of cheating and forgery.""

""The persons involved should have been suspended and criminal prosecution launched but no such action was initiated. After 10 years of the commission of offence, the director of school education says that the reports from the DEO (district education officer) are awaited an the CID says that they are awaiting clarification from UGC,"" explained the forum in it's representation.

The forum suspects that the school education department has not initiated any action against the teachers as it is under pressure from various unions.

With no action taken against the teachers, officials suspect that many of them may still be in-service. ""While many of them who obtained such bogus certificates for promotions may have retired in the last 10 years. However, those who procured such fake certificates to secure jobs in government schools may still be working. It is a worrying factor as the quality of teaching that they impart may be poor,"" said M Padmanabh Reddy, secretary of the forum.

An RTI appeal by a citybased civil society had revealed that of the 878 teachers and headmasters, working in government schools across the state, highest number of teachers i.e. 345 with fake degrees hail from Medak. In some cases, the teachers even produced certificates of nonexistent courses from distance universities.

Officials said that most certificates submitted by the teachers were of bachelor of education and master of arts (English literature) and forged by unscrupulous elements. Some teachers even got away with forging certificates of different Vidhyapeeths that are not competent to issue certificates."

A defunct government school at the remote Mallapur village in Raichur district in north Karnataka is now abuzz with activity, thanks to the efforts made by Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI) B K Nandanoor. The school, which had shut its doors in August this year, started operating from December 18, and at least four children have resumed studies.Setting an example of a grassroots initiative, Nandanoor got the government school reopened after residents approached him.The school was shut after a teacher was suspended and the students dropped out, even though a new teacher was deputed.

Karnataka High Court: Makeover moves for B'luru

Bengaluru's aesthetic beauty has been restored, city roads are free from potholes, and cleanliness has improved -- all thanks to the Karnataka High Court, which woke up BBMP from slumber. Acting on a batch of PILs, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Dinesh Maheshwari directed BBMP to preserve the city's visual appeal by removing illegal hoardings, flexes and banners. Due to this, new bye-laws are being evolved to regulate hoardings. BBMP officials even registered an FIR against Minister D K Shivakumar for not removing an unauthorised ad, despite being given time. Citizens also got relief from pothole-riddled roads and garbage piles in public areas. The court availed the assistance of Army engineers to check the quality of work done by BBMP.

Nanditha: The power of one student

Nanditha (11) gets the undivided attention of her teacher every day. The resident of Obenahalli in Kolar is the sole student in the Government Primary School. The school, which was shut down at the start of the year 2016-17 after most students left it for private institutions, was reopened on the insistence of Nanditha, her parents and well-wishers. Komala GK, Nanditha's teacher, recalled how her parents, who work as daily wage workers, came looking for her all the way to the new school where she was posted. ""I could see anger, fear and sadness in them. They asked me what their daughter should do with the school closed."" The government was forced to reopen the school at the start of the 2017-18 year and admit Nanditha. Now even when her teacher takes leave, another one is deputed.

Namma Thambis: Green warriors of Ulsoor Lake

On October 10 this year, over 1,000 Thambis of the Madras Sappers waded into the waters of Bengaluru's Ulsoor lake and fought a war against an invasion, and won it. The battle was against water hyacinth, a weed. Ulsoor lake, situated in the heart of the IT City,is also used by the Sappers for training. Tired of seeing their lifeline being suffocated owing to pollution, the Sappers took matter into their own hands. The soldiers,on boats, pulled out the waste using their bare hands. They also removed plastic waste, household rubbish and other garbage. At the end of the day, the Army also issued a wake-up call in their signature fashion, blunt and to the point: ""People should understand that it is not the business of the Army to become garbage cleaners.""

Ananya:Hero in the hills

Ananya Vasudev RM saved 15 families of Karike village in Kodagu district during this year's floods and subsequent landslides. Ananya Vasudev,an assistant lecturer of Geology at the National Institute of Technology, received a WhatsApp video from a friend which showed loud sound emanating from the ground. Ananya Vasudev asked his friend to send another video. After seeing the fresh video, he was sure the sound was due to soil piping and the area could see a landslide. Soil piping is a formation of voids within soil which causes internal erosion and seepage. He immediately spoke to Kodagu Deputy Commissioner Sreevidya who sent a team to the village and evacuated the families. As predicted by Ananya, the area saw a huge landslide a few hours later.

S B Vastradmath: Speedy justice his goal

Chitradurga district court judge S B Vastradmath has done his bit to ensure that the public reposes its faith in the judiciary by delivery of quick judgments. Recently, he was in new for sentencing a man who killed his wife to life imprisonment within 13 days of the crime. He pronounced another judgment within 11 days of the crime. In September, the judge delivered 153 judgments in 22 days without taking a day's leave. He has broken his own record of achieving 70 points in a single calender month, which was earlier set by him during his tenure as the Civil Judge (Jr division) at Molakalmuru. In the system to evaluate judges, a point is awarded for each judgment where the maximum is 70 points irrespective of the number of cases. Vastramath says awarding death penalty to 3 men accused of rape and torture of a woman in Kolar was his most memorable judgment.

This 38-year-old Mysuru resident has been carrying out this job for the past two decades. As soon as members of the public, hospitals or even the police inform him about unclaimed bodies, Ahmed reaches the spot in his old Ambassador car and takes the body.

Ahmed posts photos of the bodies on his Facebook page in the hope of reaching out to the kin of the deceased. In absence of claims, he gets the paperwork done, after which he takes the unclaimed bodies to the graveyard and performs the last rites as per their religion.

Krishna Byregowda:Crusade against plastic

At a time when plastic water bottles were the norm in government offices, Rural Development Minister Krishna Byregowda decided to do away with them at his offices and meetings. He replaced the plastic bottles with glass tumblers and reusable water bottles. Byregowda even carries a personal water bottle to the Assembly and Council to avoid using plastic or paper cups. Each person who visits the minister's office is served water in a glass tumbler, unlike the popular practice in most government offices where water is given in plastic or paper cups. Such was the impact of his approach to the matter that the CM asked officials to refrain from distributing water in plastic bottles at all government events.

Randeep D: Official in public demand

That good work seldom goes unnoticed was proved in the case of IAS officer Randeep D, who was brought back as the Additional Commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) owing to public pressure after being shunted from the position. Randeep was transferred by an order signed by Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy as the Commissioner of Social Welfare Department. However, he had earned the confidence of waste management activists for his attempts to reform the ill-managed system in the city. Randeep was credited with setting up the Solid Waste Management control room, bringing proposals of GPS tracking of auto-tippers and compactors, and updating the microplan. Activists pointed out his role in implementation of standard operating with regarding BBMP's Animal Husbandry Department. This led citizens to launch an online campaign to demand his reinstatement. After the campaign got the support of about 1,000 people, Kumaraswamy had to take a relook at his decision.

Kempaiah: BEO answers the call

An inspiring act by the Block Education Officer of Bangarpet Taluk went a long way to show how personal involvement can improve the learning ambience for children. Kempaiah shocked the school administration authorities, as well as teachers and students during a visit to a Kannada Higher Primary School in the district -- he cleaned a blocked toilet. Kempaiah had decided to visit the school to see the conditions for himself after he received several complaints from parents about the unhygienic conditions in the classrooms and toilet. While checking the toilets, when he saw it blocked, he got to his knees and started cleaning it with a brush. He had expressed to TNIE that it was unfortunate that the teachers and anganwadi workers had not kept the school clean. The girls in the school were forced to walk to their homes in the village for toilet breaks during class hours.

Inscription Stones of Bangalore: Documenting city's history

A civic activism project, ""Inscription Stones of Bangalore"" aims at creating awareness about and protecting ancient stone inscriptions (shila shaasanas) found in the Bengaluru region. The group has discovered several new inscription stones and restored the neglected ones by relocating them to a respectful place. They have educated citizens through postcards, public talks, school visits, poster presentations and other group- funding initiatives. With the help of latest technology, they have created 3D models of critically-endangered stone inscriptions. This project follows in the footsteps of B L Rice, who between 1894 and 1905, documented the stones in his 12-volume book, Epigraphia Carnatica. The project also acts as a platform for interested Bengaluru residents to work towards conservation of these ancient stones, which speak a lot about the Garden City's rich cultural past."

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

A Chinese kindergarten teacher was on Friday jailed for 18 months for abusing children with needles, a Beijing court said, sparking criticism online that the sentence was too short.

Liu Yanan, who was a teacher at the RYB Education New World kindergarten, pricked four children with needles in November 2017, the Beijing Chaoyang Court said. The scandal triggered national outrage.

An investigation into the kindergarten began when parents found needle marks on their toddlers who attended the high-end, bilingual Chinese-English school. There were also allegations that the children were made to take mysterious pills.

""The circumstances were vile. Her behaviour has seriously damaged the physical and mental health of minors,"" the court said in a statement, adding that the abuse did not result in any lasting injury.

Liu has also been banned from working with minors for five years after serving her sentence.

RYB Education, a New York-listed company which runs the chain of kindergartens, apologised for the incident and stressed on their official social media account the abuse was carried out by an individual.

However there was huge criticism of the sentence online, with many social media users angered that no officials have been punished.

Three Beijing education officials were under investigation for ""lack of supervision"" but the case has not progressed.

""The cost to commit a crime is too low! This is condoning crimes!"" read one post on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform, saying that Liu should have been given a lifetime ban from working in education.

The incident prompted the State Council, China's top administrative body, to call for an ""immediate"" investigation into all kindergartens across the country.

RYB Education owns some 500 kindergartens and nearly 1,300 learning centres across China for children up to the age of six, according to its website.

The scandal was not the first to hit the company.

RYB suspended the head of a Beijing kindergarten in April 2017 after videos surfaced of teachers throwing a child on a bed and kicking another in the back.

In 2016, two teachers from a RYB kindergarten in northeast Jilin province were jailed for 34 months for jabbing children's heads, mouths and buttocks with sewing needles. (AFP) SMJ SMJ"

Images of the punished students, who went to Chaitanya Bharathi School at Punganur, were subsequently posted on Twitter.

According to reports, a complaint was registered against the school management, and education authorities have begun investigating the incident. There are also demands to cancel the school's registration.

This is not the first time such an incident has been reported in the state. NDTV reported that in 2015, two students of a government school in Bheemunipatnam Mandal were hospitalised after a teacher allegedly asked them to take off their shirts and stand in the sun, as punishment for not doing their homework.

The students, who are brothers, reportedly collapsed after standing in the heat for nearly three hours. Two teachers, Rani Kumari and Anil Kumar were suspended, The News Minute reported.

The incident came days after a 13-year-old student in Andhra Pradesh alleged that her school principal forced her to take a pregnancy test, over suspicions that she was having an affair with a teacher.

Activists, social media hits back

Following the incident, child rights activists and netizens alike condemned the incident. Child rights activists have alleged that the principal of the private school and the local divisional educational officer tried to hush up the incident when the video of punishment went viral and the parents lodged a protest, India Today reported.

India Today also quoted activist Achyut Rao as saying: ""We earnestly request the (National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights) to issue orders to initiate action under the provisions of Posco Act and immediately order an enquiry.""

On Twitter, one user tweeted: ""Shocking punishment by a private school In Chittoor #AndhraPradesh, minor students were forced to stand necked as they came late to the school. Child rights activists demand criminal action on management.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach.

Lakhe, against whom more serious charges of Rs 25 crore alleged scam has surfaced, has been virtually let off by the university. The professor was chief of spot valuation centre at NU's exam section from 2006 to 2013.

However, the NU has only revealed about Lakhe failing to return Rs 60 lakh leftover from the exam works between 2011 and 2012. In several RTI queries, the NU has refused to give details of the expenses incurred under Lakhe. In 2016, Lakhe had claimed that he had returned the Rs 60 lakh through two cheques but the NU has refused information about these transactions.

Governor Ch Vidyasagar Rao's office had earlier this year sought a factual report on Lakhe from the NU administration. The chancellor's office had also called for interest accrued on the amount held back by Lakhe following a complaint to him.

As compared to Lakhe, the NU has taken swift action in two recent cases which apparently comprises are smaller amount of money, belonging to students.

On December 5, vice-chancellor SP Kane had removed Kalpana Jadhav from the post of sports director before he left for his US tour.

The decision to remove Jadhav has now come under scanner with several officials terming it as an 'unfair'. It is alleged that the purchases worth Rs 13 to 14 lakhs were made.

In May, the NU had suspended associate professor Prakash Shedmake who allegedly embezzlement Rs 20lakh that had to be refunded to hostel students after completion of their term besides another couple of lakhs from furniture funds. Officials say the NU could have filed an FIR or scrapped his teacher approval.

Pro-VC Pramod Yeole said that Lakhe has cleared his dues. But, he refused to comment on the action NU could have taken in the case.

Director of examinations and evaluation Neeraj Khaty said though dues have been paid the ""final settlement"" is remaining and will be done soon.

The allegation against Jadhav do not directly point to any financial fraud but only the that she failed to seek approval of purchase committee while procuring sports gear for athletes."

A muffled traffic buzz manages to intrude the 'silent' confines of a library on the busy Cowly Brown road in Coimbatore. The unassuming two-storey building is nevertheless the district central library, the largest public library in the city, which seems to be in a hurry to go 'paperless'.

A register at the entrance with a pen strung to it, where visitors sign in and sign out, does not give away much about the library that provides access to about 3 lakh books of all categories for a modest annual membership fee of Rs 60, and is just a month away from implementing the tracking technology, radio frequency identification (RFID).

There are 199 libraries (including village and grade two levels) tucked away in various parts of Coimbatore. Starved of a meaningful upgrade for more than five years now, a Rs 7 crore grant by the state's Minister for Education K A Sengottaiyan, this year, has come as a welcome move that can bring about a substantial overhaul in terms of book replenishment, says N Manikandan, district library officer in charge of Tirupur and Coimbatore districts.

For instance, in 2015-16, the central district library added 7,090 books valued at Rs 1,073,126 to its collection. While 2016-17 didn't see any addition at all, 2,781 books costing Rs 1,195,554 were added in 2017-18.

Started in 1952, the central district library has about 62,000 members on its roll and 700 visiting it every day, which includes newspaper loyalists, while the second biggest branch library in Coimbatore's busy Town Hall with about 80,359 books, has 230 visiting it on a daily basis.

Students at the research section

About 110,000 visitors have used the district library in the year 2017-18, with a large proportion of them having benefited from its research material. These numbers suggest libraries have become centres of allied activities - a shift from the passive role of a book lender to engaging visitors in enterprising projects. For instance, as part of the district library's non-customary programmes, a group of retired professors have been mentoring civil service aspirants for the past one year.

""The lectures we organise have drawn a lot of interest, and this is one way to encourage library visits,"" said Manikandan, who sits at the district library headquarters in Town Hall, which also hosts the branch library.

This has also redefined their purpose, which has acquired a more academic character. A key role of the library today is to put vast resources at the disposal of students preparing for civil services and competitive examinations, which include online access to important data. He cites Megastar, an online resource platform that gives access to 250 magazines, as an example.

Though a handful of youngsters poring over bulky books and handwritten notes in the research chamber of the district library appear to recreate a classroom environment, they are a content lot. ""I refer books here from morning until evening,"" says Elakiya Ravindra Kumar, a civil service aspirant. Pointing to a pair of computer systems, she says they can access research material and get ready assistance from librarians to locate books and other material.

So, sceptics who are weighing libraries' relevance in the digital age may have to settle for the truth that these repositories of books are not hastening to fade into oblivion, as the district central librarian P Rajendran vouches: ""Physical books are not going away anywhere soon, though we are digitising library management at all levels possible. Our transactions, lending and sorting of books returned, are digitised, and the implementation of RFID is only going to make tracking easier and circulation operations more efficient and faster.""

RFID will also limit all sorts of losses to the library such as book theft, said the librarian. However, he said with a smile, the library treats this 'offence' with leniency as it's love of books that triggers this temptation, though, he said, it will deprive an equally deserving reader of a book that has been 'unceremoniously' taken off the shelf.

Some limitations even with a reasonable extent of digitisation is the difficulty in locating 'mislaid' books. Visitors browsing through the shelves may inadvertently leave a history book in the literature section, where it will languish for years.

Every section of readers from men, women and children to the physically/intellectually challenged has a place in the library that has 60 per cent Tamil and 40 per cent English books, said Rajendran.

Stepping into the hallway of the library, the outstanding facilities for the differently-abled don't go unnoticed. A carefully designed section is fitted out with the gear that help the blind and other physically- and intellectually-challenged visitors experience library 'moments'.

Specially adapted computer keyboards like low vision/large print accessory, braille books, 'magnetic minds' for hand and eye coordination, tactile graphics for the visually challenged, specifically designed chess boards, and geometry and algebra kits are a small part of the paraphernalia helping the differently-abled readers, about 15 of them who visit the library mostly during the weekends, experience reading in a library.

Books for differently-abled children sit on low-built shelves

Low-built shelves and a wheel-chair ramp and trained staff at the section said a lot about the thought that has gone into making the library accessible to all.

Rajendran said with the aid of the 'read easy' device, which supports an audio format, some of their visually challenged scholar readers have gone on to acquire a PhD. The library also arranges volunteers to assist the visually-challenged with their exams.

The colourfully designed children's section, if one ignores some of the broken soft toys and ill-matched furnishings, stands in stark contrast to the adjoining reading room with its conventional carrels, and empty shelves waiting for 'new arrivals'. While there is a separate book-lending section for children, next to the women's reading section, this enclosure is used for story-reading.

""We have expert teachers volunteering to read stories to about 50 children during the weekends,"" Rajendran said, adding, summer camps coordinated by the library is very popular, and about 50 to 70 children attend them on an average.

The branch library in Town Hall

The branch library in Town Hall, though modest, is a place where neighbouring residents spend some quiet time and keep the library tradition alive. An incomprehensible combination of numbers and letters pasted on the books sitting on rudimentary iron shelves are ""the codes holding the description and location of books,"" explained chief librarian M Manimekalai.

Used mostly by students preparing for civil services, the library is also visited by the older generation, especially to read newspapers and know the day's happenings, she said.

The library landscape of Coimbatore is dotted with university libraries, which of course, provide limited access to their resources. For the purpose of this article, the Bharathiar University, which has the third-largest collection of books in the state, next to only the Madras University and Madurai Kamaraj University, was selected.

With a book stock of 2 lakh, the sprawling university campus is home to one of the most technologically advanced library facilities. ""We have a reading lab fitted with 40 computer systems, which the students use to read, download material from and for reference,"" said university librarian Dr R Sarangapani.

""Students use internet protocol address, mostly, to access a vast source of professional journals and books for their dissertations,"" he said.

A leading example of source for research was INFLIBNET, an autonomous inter-university centre of the University Grants Commission under the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD). ""It was available for five years, from 2012 to 2017, but now the services have been suspended. The MHRD is in talks with the government to restore it,"" said Sarangapani.

Bharathiar University's e-resources also comprise the opulent publications database built by its faculty. The university has been ranked thirteenth for research development by MHRD's National Institutional Ranking Framework.

In order to stay relevant and more useful, libraries have indeed moved beyond facilitating reading for pleasure. Its custodian's role, too, has expanded from just physically curating operations to managing and streamlining electronic content.

Why we need a building when the world is turning 'bookless' is a question that may have to wait, perhaps forever, as books emanate an energy that is palpable and libraries would remain the top-shelf option as long as there is a zeal for credibility and community.

Perhaps, this thought was on French philosopher Jean-Paul Satre's mind when he described his library moments as a child: ""I set off on incredible adventures. This meant climbing chairs and tables, at the risk of provoking avalanches which might have buried me.""

Walking through the silent alleys of the district library, I traced my fingers along the spine of the books, content to realise they will continue to serve readers through the twenty-first century, with e-books and devices supporting alongside the pursuit for limitless information and knowledge."

Holding placards and posters such as 'We need roads,' the tribal women said that the Maoists should allow the development in the Agency.

In the absence of road connectivity, it was becoming difficult to shift villagers who needed medical attention to hospital. In the latest instance, a pregnant woman died as ambulance was not able to reach Theemalabandha village.

Also, children are not able to attend school, so as the teachers, which is eventually disturbing the education system in the region. The villagers said they also need cell phone towers to be in touch with their family members and relatives, and urged the Maoists not to damage them.

Road works were suspended for over a year in Kukumpudi area after the Maoists torched the equipment. ""Maoists should let the development continue,"" the villagers said."

The accused Balakrushna Mohapatra has gone absconding and a search has been launched by the police to apprehend him. Mohapatra had allegedly sexually assaulted a Class IX student and boarder of the girls hostel the night before Ganesh Puja this year. The girl was taking part in the decoration of the puja mandap in the school when the headmaster committed the heinous act.

He had allegedly asked the other girls to leave the room and attempted to rape her. Thereafter too, he had frequently molested the girl and shut her up by threatening her of dire consequences. He had even threatened to not allow her to appear in the matriculation exams if she disclosed anything. The girl had informed her parents but they also kept quiet out of fear for the safety of their daughter's life and future.

The matter, however, came to light recently when a group of villagers complained to the Collector Parag Harshad Gavali about the nefarious activities going on in the school. The Collector asked District Welfare Officer (DWO) and Sub-Collector to inquire into the allegations. The victim had mustered the courage to reveal everything before the visiting officials. Based on their report, a show cause was issued to Mohapatra. As his reply was not satisfactory, the Collector placed him under suspension. The DWO also filed a police complaint in the connection.

Sources said in the past, Mohapatra was the president of District Primary Teachers Association but he was removed from the post after similar allegations were levelled against him. Villagers had alleged that since he was close to politicians of the area, he was not transferred for the last 18 years."

The petitioner said that earlier there was a section under the Kerala Education Act by which the PSC had to select teachers for appointments in government and the aided schools.

However, the original section was suspended through an Ordinance in 1960.

The subsequent sections had empowered the managements to make appointments even while the government paid their emoluments.

As per the sections inserted later, now the government only have to approve the appointments already made by the respective managements.

In fact, the present practice had paved the way for widespread corruption and denial of employments to eligible and meritorious candidates who were not rich enough to pay donations to the managements."

The Kerala High Court has ordered the reinstatement of a professor at the Central University of Kerala in Kasaragod who was suspended for criticising on Facebook the institution's action against a Dalit scholar, Live Law reported.

The university has been in turmoil in recent months with students and teachers protesting against a series of ""disciplinary actions"" against leftist and Dalit activists that was seen as attempts to crush dissent.

The court, in a judgement on December 5, criticised the university for suspending Associate Professor Prasad Pannian, who had questioned the institution's move to file a police complaint against PhD scholar Ganthoti Nagaraju for breaking the glass pane of a fire alarm. Nagaraju was arrested on the basis of the complaint. Pannian, who was removed as the head of the department of English and Comparative Literature on September 7, had said the administration should not have involved the police in the matter.

""One cannot be prevented from expressing his views merely because he is an employee,"" Justice Muhamed Mustaque said in his judgement. ""In a democratic society, every institution is governed by democratic norms. Healthy criticism is a better way to govern a public institution.""

The university argued in court that it was the vice chancellor's prerogative to appoint heads of departments. However, Mustaque said the decision needed to be examined as it would be seen as a stain on Pannian's career and reputation.

""Posting in Facebook or social media has become a matter of concern for public authorities,"" the court said. ""It is a matter of formulation of opinion of others. As pointed out by this court in several judgements, in the absence of any social media guidelines, such post has to be viewed to find out whether it would be detrimental to the collective interest of the university. The expression of opinion of a teacher in regard to an action cannot be considered as a criticism."""
