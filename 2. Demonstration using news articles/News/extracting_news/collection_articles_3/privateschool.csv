LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

Nivedita sustained a fracture in the right arm and multiple bruises in the incident.

Stating that over 60 kids in Wazirpur village go to the same school, Mr. Mishra said seven to eight private vans have taken ""control"" of transportation to school.

""We have requested the authorities at Rosary Senior Secondary School to provide a bus so many times. We have told them that there are many students from the area and that they should provide a bus but all our pleas have fallen on deaf ears. We have also written several letters to the school authorities in connection with our demand over the last few years,"" Mr. Mishra alleged.

The school could not be reached for a comment.

To a question on whether he felt it was safe to send Nivedita in a van ferrying over 10 children, Mr. Mishra added, ""It did not feel unsafe till now because about 10 children below the age of 15 years can fit inside the vehicle comfortably. But after Tuesday's accident, I am not sure what we will do from now on.""

Seven-year-old Sarthak Giri, a student of Class II, sustained severe injuries on the head and received 11 stitches. His parents agreed with Mr. Mishra's concerns over the lack of a school bus to ferry the kids.

The accused driver of the mini tempo, identified as Salman (21), has been arrested on charges of rash driving, causing hurt by act endangering life and causing death by negligence, a senior police said."

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

The president of a private school management was stabbed to death in Magadi Road police station limits on Sunday morning.

The victim Ranganath, who was running Havanur Public School at Basaveshwaranagar, was assaulted by three men and stabbed to death in the school office.

The police suspect civil dispute to have been the cause of the murder. According to the police, there was a longstanding dispute over a CA site adjacent to the school premises.

Recently, a court gave a verdict in favour of the school, and accordingly, on October 12, Bangalore Development Authority sent people to evict the family that was residing on the premises. Part of the house was razed after which some of the family members were allegedly upset with the school management for rendering them homeless.

According to the police, on Sunday morning, three members of the family wanted to meet the school management to settle the dispute. Ranganath invited them to his office, but an argument ensued, and one of the three men stabbed him. The trio then fled from the spot. Ranganath was taken to a local hospital where he was declared brought dead, the police said.

Authorities were shocked over the hazardous environment on the school premises. The school was functioning from under construction buildings - three and five storey buildings - on either side of the highway between Tiruvannamalai and Villupuram.

The school lacked basic amenities. ""There is no latrine or restroom for students in the school that has 1,300 students from primary class to Class XII,"" secretary and sub-judge K Rajmohan told TOI.

Kumar, against whom a few managers have raised the war cry, had earned all-round appreciation from students and parents across the state after he proactively intervened and stopped unhealthy practices that were going on unchecked in CBSE schools.

Recently, an 'unanimous resolution' on the letterhead of the Kerala CBSE School Management Association was submitted as a memorandum to Kumar and a copy was sent to member schools. The association has around 1,400 schools as members.

Signed by association president T P M Ibrahim Khan, the 'resolution' listed out recent 'actions' of Kumar which, if repeated, ""would adversely affect even the existence of CBSE schools in the state.""

The 'resolution' also interpreted actions taken by Kumar as ""creating havoc among schools, especially in Muslim minority schools.""

It said the RO's orders had ""created disappointment among the minority community.""

'Resolution unauthorised'

Ironically, the association's general secretary and working president have come out against the 'resolution'. Sources said they had asked the president (Ibrahim) why such a 'resolution' was prepared without the executive committee's authorisation.

Meanwhile, three of the four schools run by minority community managements, listed as 'aggrieved parties', are understood to have objected to the 'resolution'. It is learnt schools which distanced themselves from the resolution were opposed to being used as pawns to build a case against Kumar, who has an impeccable track record.

Strong action

Kumar had created a flutter when he inspected a school in Kollam based on widespread complaints. He proceeded fine the school Rs 2 lakh - the highest ever in the country - for poor infrastructure, unsafe classrooms and several other unfair practices.

Kumar's intervention ended several unfair practices by schools such as collection of huge amounts as 'development fee', charging fees for issuing transfer certificates, collecting 'caution deposit' from teachers, overcharging students for textbooks and conducting unauthorised exams.

Kumar ruffled a few feathers when he took action against a prominent school in the capital for conducting entrance coaching classes outside the school premises but promoting it on its official website. He also cracked the whip on an unauthorised association of school managements from the minority community which fleeced students and compelled them to attend 'talent search exams' having communally divisive content.

THE 'CHARGES'

■ Conducted inspections, created 'terror' in schools

■ Undermined the existence of CBSE schools

■ Created 'havoc' in Muslim minority schools

ACTIONS TAKEN

■ Fined schools found engaging in malpractices

■ Ended collection of unauthorised fees from students

■ Banned talent search exams having communal colour

■ Curbed entrance coaching centres in schools"

""Overloaded vans put children's lives at risk. We will not allow private vans to carry more children than the subscribed limit. We will run a special campaign to challan private van operators who flout the rules,"" Munish Sharma, additional deputy commissioner, said.

In line with its Surakshit Vahan Policy, there are committees at the state-, district- and sub-district levels that have laid down rules for ensuring safety of schoolchildren.

As per the policy, vehicles engaged in carrying schoolchildren cannot ferry children in excess of 1.5 times the vehicle's registered seating capacity. However, poor implementation of rules and lax monitoring has failed to keep a check on accidents involving these vans.

Srinagar: While it seems the General Administration Department is trying to make strike calls 'a failure' by installing Bio-metric Systems in government offices in Jammu and Kashmir, some private educational institutions are also pressing the employees to reach offices on strike days, jeopardizing their lives.

However, the school admins deny the allegations saying the staff 'enjoys' holiday on a strike day.

Kashmir, which is caught up in a conflict as both India and Pakistan claim the territory and have fought three wars over it. In order to protest the 'atrocities of the Indian armed forces', the Joint Resistance Leadership, calls for shutdowns and strikes in order to send out a message to the world that everything is not right in the valley.

On strike days, the business and offices are supposed to come to a halt for the said dates. It only incurs losses to Kashmir and education is also a sector that suffers grossly. At present, on strike days, the educational institutions send text messages to parents asking them to keep their wards at home. However, the staff members are asked to come to the school.

""Whatever be the case, we are supposed to go. The authorities would try to keep us engaged with paperwork but we would really face hardships in order to mark the attendance,"" says a former teacher from a private institution located in Pulwama. On condition of keeping his and the school's identity anonymous, he also told Free Press Kashmir that the school would force the local teachers to come to the school and make them sign a contract so they don't claim the salary for the vacation time.

""On the days when we work, we work enough to deserve the salary while the school is shut. The contract they would make us sign would remain with them. Asking for salary or not coming on strike days meant termination,"" he says adding that he resigned from the school.

The teachers from Srinagar would be allowed to stay back home while the local teachers from the 'always on boil' Pulwama would be asked to attend the school with no students to teach.

""Pulwama is the area that is not safe to travel. When you leave home in formals, you send a message that you are not on strike which hurts the sentiments of those who are on strike. This is something that the school doesn't consider. We literally risk our lives for peanuts,"" says the tutor.

Moreover, teachers from Urban areas complain about the same, saying that they ought to attend the school despite all odds. While talking to FPK, a faculty member from Oasis Educational Institute said that the administration calls them to school even if they have to kill time just by sitting there.

""The students are sitting at home and we are asked to come. We keep sitting for the day but we are not allowed to stay back home. This not only puts our lives at risk but also frustrates us,"" said the member. The school authorities did not respond to the calls on the contact number provided on their website.

Another institute, International Islamic School (IIS) also follows the same line when it comes to going against the strike calls.

""The staff would not be allowed to leave early on Fridays, not to talk of the strike days. Even today, it follows the same lines,"" says a former employee from IIS.

While in rural areas, the authorities threaten the employees out loud, here in Srinagar the authorities deny all the allegations.

""The staff doesn't come on strike days. They enjoy the holiday at their home. In fact, we pay them for that day too,"" said the Public Relations Officer of IIS.

""When the call for the strike is not so serious, we do come to the school. On that day, we work on the maintenance of registers, hold meetings, check and update the syllabus, make activity reports. There is always something we get to work on,"" says Khawaja Irfan, a +2 lecturer from Tyndale Biscoe School, Srinagar.

""Even on days when we don't have much to do, we play matches and the time passes. On strict strike call days, we are asked to stay home but the non-teaching staff is supposed to come, come what may,"" Ifran says.

An official from the school told FPK that ""it doesn't matter to the non-teaching staff whether there is a strike or not.""

""We have nothing to do with the children. We have official work and that is what we are supposed to do even when there are strikes. So, we come,"" he says, wishing to remain anonymous.

""There's no statutory prohibition for a management to fix a particular fee for an academic year and there's no guideline issued by the CBSE as to how the fee structure should be maintained,"" ruled the High Court recently.

This was in connection with a case in which parents protested the sudden fee hike by a CBSE-affiliated school in Ernakulam. The CBSE regional office has come across instances in which some affiliated schools in the state were found to have collected as many as 20 different types of fees.These included 'Computer Fee' from four-year-old LKG students and fees for conducting talent search exams of private agencies from all students.

CBSE school management representatives played down fleecing instances as 'isolated cases'. ""Most of the CBSE-affiliated schools are charging fees according to the facilities provided to students. It's unfair to cite a few cases and say that all CBSE schools are fleecing students,"" said Kerala CBSE School Management Association general secretary Indira Rajan.

However, frequent complaints on the part of parents have put the spotlight on the need to set up a fee regulatory body for unaided schools on the lines of self-financing professional colleges. Already, states such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam have enacted laws regulating the fee structure of private schools.

Government cites helplessness

""The state government had imposed certain stringent conditions as a prerequisite for granting of NOC to unaided schools with a view to bring in some sort of regulation over such institutions. But the move was turned down by the Supreme court,"" said General Education Secretary A Shajahan.However, the government's sincerity in the matter has been questioned by certain quarters.

""The government is maintaining criminal silence on the issue and has given unaided schools a free hand. If the government has any sincerity, it should urgently bring in a regulatory mechanism to prevent fleecing of students.

""Students who go to private schools have better exposure and can get privately coached for competitive exams. School is the only exposure for government school students. When Class 11 public exam's importance is reduced, students will not have incentive to study well,"" he said.

Tough regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools must be eased as soon as possible.

Can launching 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings improve the situation?

The Narendra Modi government is seized of the importance of ensuring the ease of doing business in the country and rightly so. Since 2015, it has taken a series of concerted reforms to climb on the World Bank's annual rankings. The country's big jump from 142 to 100 in just three years is testament to the government's efforts.

A similar if not more urgent initiative is required in facilitating the ease of opening and running a private, unaided school. Though many may frown upon labelling education as a business, but this is all the more reason to show urgency in liberalising the norms and regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools. As India's middle class is expanding, millions of children are leaving government schools and opting for private ones. With time, this trend is likely to get stronger as more and more parents become financially empowered enough to afford private schools.

However, since the passage of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, ease of opening and running a school has become a nightmare.

On the digital and print pages of Swarajya, this writer and others have spilled enough ink detailing the ills ailing the RTE Act. We have repeatedly criticised the policy of keeping minorities out of ambit of the act in toto; important sections like number 12 that mandates 25 per cent quota for students from disadvantaged groups/weaker sections in private unaided non-minority schools; section 13 that bars any kind of screening for admitting students; section 16 which allows mandatory promotion to the next class irrespective of the performance and learning; and so on.

However, one important aspect of the act that has escaped the much needed scrutiny is the set of regulations surrounding the recognition of a school which is the fundamental requirement to run a school. Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE deal with rules and restrictions in this regard.

These state that no private school shall be established or run without obtaining a certificate of recognition from the appropriate government authority on fulfilling certain norms and standards as laid out in Schedule in such form and manner, within such period, and subject to such conditions as laid out in rule 11 and rule 12 of ""Model Rules Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

What are the norms and standards set out in the Schedule? First, the minimum number of teachers a school must have from classes I to VIII depending on the strength of the class. Second, the building requirements (kitchen, playground, number of classrooms, etc). Third, minimum number of working days in a year. Fourth, minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher. Fifth, use of teaching aid for each class. Sixth, library. Seventh, play material, games, and sports equipment.

What do the rule 11 and 12 of Model Rules say? After conforming to the above norms, every school has to fill out Form 1 declaring that:

the school is run by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force;the school is not run for profit to any individual, group or association of individuals or any other persons;the school conforms to the values enshrined in the Constitutionthe school buildings or other structures or the grounds are used only for the purposes of education and skill development;the school is open to inspection by any officer authorised by the state government/local authority;the school furnishes such reports and information as may be required by the Director of Education/District Education Officer from time to time and complies with such instructions of the state government/local authority as may be issued to secure the continued fulfillment of the condition of recognition or the removal of deficiencies in working of the school

Apart from these, there are eight tables of details to be filled in Form 1 such as:

Then the District Education Officer (DEO) carries out an inspection to see if the requirements have been met and give the certificate of recognition. However, it is temporary, to be renewed every three years and is only for primary classes i.e. up to standard VIII. For higher classes, there are separate, and similarly, those who run schools without obtaining a certificate of recognition can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 per day.

As if these onerous requirements, especially the ones highlighted, were not enough, it is pertinent to note that these are merely those mandated by the central act. The states have their own, additional level of requirements. Most prominent of these is 'Essentiality certificate"" aka the 'no objection certificate' awarded by the state government's Department of Education for five years.

Even by-laws of central boards like the CBSE insist on this prized possession as preliminary necessity before giving affiliation to schools. On top of all this, there are permissions and plans - building, health, water, land use permitted, etc - to be sought from municipality.

The situation is so bad that even elite schools with decades of reputation of delivering great service and education have to face extreme levels of bureaucratic red-tapism. Sachin Tendulkar's school Shardashram Vidyamandir wanted to amend affiliation board from SSC to ICSE for Class 1 to Class IV and also wanted to change its name. Both the requests were dismissed by BMC officials stating that it has given NOC for SSC board till 2020 so it must continue with the same.

If this is the condition for established players who can be treated in such a manner by a municipal corporation, one can imagine what effect they will have on genuine players willing to enter the field. The regulations can induce bouts of trauma into even the most spirited of edupreneurs.

The language of the RTE Act and other rules indicates that the State is more concerned with reigning in the growth of private schools than facilitating right to education for everyone in reality.

While the regulations provide for elaborate monetary punishments which can even lead to closure of the school for not getting the recognition, there is hardly anything about the government's laxity in giving the certificates. The Haryana government is yet to grant recognition for around 3,200 private schools operating since 2003 in the state. Without recognition they can't even apply to the Haryana board for affiliation. Wonder why no act penalises the government, say Rs 10,000 per day per school, for each day's delay in granting recognition (or rejecting it as the case may be)? Even if these schools are given recognition, it will only be for a year. The situation is similar in Odisha and Kerala too. The future of thousands of schools in the country, year after year, depends on government's arbitrary decisions.

Also, the government can announce any new set of arbitrary conditions as the Uttar Pradesh government did recently when it made it mandatory for all schools to install CCTVs and biometric machines for attendance to seek recognition from the UP board.

And if the schools protest, the government can pass an order ruling that agitating against the government can lead to withdrawal of recognition as the Chandigarh education department did this year.

Such a regime is bad enough for any business. It's disastrous and suicidal to have it in private education sector which is the only hope left for the lower middle class and poor to climb up the social and economic ladder. Every day we continue with this system, we are inflicting great damage to the students from the lower strata of our populace who are highly disproportionately enrolled in the failed government schools. In its zeal to put a leash on private schools in the name of curbing profiteering, what the government has achieved is monopoly of those who are now experts at gaming the system through underhanded ways and means. The genuine educationists and philanthropists dare not enter the market.

What can the Modi government do? For starters, it can launch national 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings. Second, it can reform the norms and procedures needed for recognition mentioned in the schedule at the back of the RTE Act. It can be done by a simple government notification as section 20 of the act mandates. There is no need for ratification by the Parliament.

To realise the goal of universal quality education, which is affordable too, the state must facilitate proliferation of private schools leading to competition. This will do more to curb profiteering than any fee regulation act ever could."

As the monsoon is not far away, local people allege the school is flirting with danger and risking the lives of its students by operating in a high-risk flood zone.

""The school is situated at the junction where an outlet channel of the Chembarambakkam lake and the Adyar river meet. This means if water is released from the lake, the school will be the first building to be hit,"" said O Udayakumar, a resident of Thiruneermalai.

According to locals, the entire area right upto the base of the nearby hill, which is, at least, one km from the school, was submerged in water upto the first floor of several buildings during the 2015 floods.

This means a repeat could completely submerge the school which is just a stone's throw away from the Adyar river and the Chembarambakkam water channel.

Interestingly, the school seems to have sacrificed 'safety for the aesthetics'.

The school buildings have been constructed right next to the river bank instead of the other extremity, which would allow some breathing space in case of emergency, though disallowing the picturesque view it boasts of now.

Though construction works were completed last year, this primary school began functioning only two months ago with a strength of 50 students and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

When Express contacted the school's management over the issue, they downplayed the risks the school faces from flooding. ""We have raised the floor two metres and will build a four-metre compound wall,"" said an official, claiming the school's basement has been sealed as a safety measure.

However, locals, who witnessed the flooding in 2015, said that no wall would stand a chance of fighting the raging water.

""Everyone just remembers 2015 because it is the most recent incident of flooding. At least, once in five years, there is flooding. It is more common than people think,"" said Udayakumar, adding that the monsoon doesn't even have to be as bad as 2015 to cause flooding."

Surprisingly, cocking a snook at police bandobast, the abductors committed the crime right under the nose of police and security personnel who were deployed in huge numbers in Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar range due to the ongoing 'Kanwar Yatra' in the holy month of Shravan.

According to Badgaon police SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the Principal and owner of Paramount Convent School, Subhash Kashyap was abducted by four unidentified persons while he was on his way back home to his village Balu Mazra on a motorcycle at around 9 pm on Thursday. When he did not return home till late into the night, his family launched a search.

In the meantime, the family got a call from the mobile of the abducted principal. An unknown person was speaking and he told the family that the principal was abducted and he would be killed if they did not pay a ransom of Rs 2 lakh for securing his release.

The principal's family, in a state of shock and panic, rushed to Badgaon Police Station to lodge an FIR after receiving the ransom call. As per SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the mobile number was put on electronic surveillance and a search operation was immediately launched. The location of the mobile number was traced to Monga jungles on Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur border, said the SHO. He added that the police party deputed to search the abducted principal stumbled upon his bullet-riddled body from the same location on as early as 4 am on Friday. While the police sent the principal's body for post-mortem examination, they recovered three motorbikes-two of abductors and one of principal - from the spot.

However, the cops were wondering why the perpetrators did not wait for ransom and killed the principal within six hours of making the call to his family. ""Possibly, the principal had recognised the abductors who could be from the same village or his acquaintances,"" said a senior police official of the district.

On Sunday, the victim K Krithiga (28), teacher in a private school, has sustained labour pain. However, she was not rushed to any of the hospitals over there. With love for natural medicine, Krithiga's husband Karthikeyan and their friends Praveen and Lavanya have assisted the pregnant women in giving birth in a natural way at their home.

Nevertheless, none of the three persons was medically qualified. ""All the three have only learnt it by watching videos in YouTube,"" said a police official. According to sources, on Sunday after delivering a baby, Krithiga went unconscious as she lost lot of blood in the placental bleed. Soon she was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.

The incident became known only after they took the body to Tirupur Government Hospital, where the doctors sought for a medical certificate from them. As the family members did not have any medical certificate, they lodged a formal complaint in the Nallur police, who have filed a case of suspicious death and are probing into the matter.

The incident has come as a shock to the health officials as there were no records that Krithiga is pregnant. ""She has not consulted the doctor, right from the time of pregnancy. We have only the details of her first pregnancy,"" a health department official said.

However, we have asked the details about her to her family members. Meanwhile, Reproductive and Child Health Commissioner Darez Ahammed has asked for a detail inquiry report in this regard.

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

Safety and security of students, protecting them from sexual abuse, guarding the rights of children who perform poorly in academics are among the key features of a new Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Aimed at regulating private schools, the bill has been welcomed by parents and educationists alike. Wilful non-compliance of such mandatory features could attract imprisonment of up to a year or a fine that could go up to Rs five lakh or both.

The Tamil Nadu Private Schools (Regulation) Bill, 2018 was adopted by the assembly on July 5. It is aimed at ensuring aspects including assurance of quality education, collection of fair fee and proper conduct of examinations. ""No private school shall prevent any pupil on its rolls from appearing for any board examinations on account of poor academic performance,"" says Section 22 (3) of the Act.

Non-compliance may invite one year imprisonment or Rs five lakh fine or both. ""It is significant as some schools in the state have the practise of not allowing poor performers to sit for board examinations,"" said a parent, P Ravikumar.

All schools now have the mandate to ensure the ""safety and security of students including protection from mental harassment or physical injury or sexual abuse,"" as per sections 20 (1) and (2). ""These provisions are timely and laudable,"" said another parent S Arun, listing out several allegations of sexual abuse by teachers.

Given accidents like the recent death of a nine-year old girl after she fell from the fourth floor of her school in Chennai and some teachers allegedly resorting to corporal punishment, the new provisions will help prevent them, he said. General Secretary, State Platform for Common School System-Tamil Nadu, P B Prince Gajendra Babu, welcoming the law said a robust mechanism should, however, be put in place to implement the Act.

""There should be a transparent mechanism in every educational district to register complaints of students and parents,"" he told PTI. He said measures ""should be in place to ensure that nobody including teachers are victimised and justice rendered to all.""

He said the focus on ending unhealthy competition among private schools and stress on fair fee collection are praiseworthy. According to section 26, which reaffirms a 2009 Tamil Nadu Act, ""no school shall collect any charge...except the fee fixed by the Fee Determination Committee.""

Against the background of incidents like a student's recent death here after he was allegedly punished by making him to do ""duck walk"" by a physical trainer, the new law will help avert such incidents, the noted education activist said.

President, TN Private Schools Association, R Visalakshi too welcomed the law saying it will provide an impetus to schools in their endeavour to provide quality education. ""It will be helpful for promoters of new schools as well,"" she said.

Referring to sub-clause 7 of Section 8 that ""no child shall be admitted in any school which has not been recognised,"" she said a list of recognised schools should be publicised by the government. If a child was admitted to an unrecognised school, it attracts a punishment of up to one year or a fine up to Rs five lakh or both (for the unrecognised institution).

""In the first place, no school without recognition should be allowed to admit students. An up-to-date list of recognised schools must be featured in the education department website,"" she said. Importance for a ""judicious mix of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities,"" and learning outcomes are among the other notable features of the new law.

The school Bill was adopted after an expert committee came up with a draft legislation which considered all relevant Acts, rules, codes and government orders in this regard. The law applies to all private -both aided and unaided-and will come into force on a date the government will notify."

Kumaraswamy on Saturday made a promise that the State government would correct the budget announcement and ensure that English is taught as a language and not used as medium of instruction, Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh appears keen to stick with the budgetary promise in letter and spirit.

In a chat with The Hindu, he said he was for opening English-medium sections in 1,000 government schools on an experimental basis to attract more students. Excerpts:

The State government's plan on opening English-medium sections in government primary schools has received a lot of criticism. Your thoughts on this?

We want to teach English as a language in all government schools. But we want to open one English-medium section in 1,000 government schools on a pilot basis. This is because government school enrolments are declining as private schools offer education in English. Take for instance a government school in my own village in Kollegal taluk. The school that had 200 students now has only around 40 as the parents, a majority of whom are daily wage labourers, want their children to study in English medium.

The decision of merging 28,847 government and aided schools with low admission rates with 8,530 nearby government schools too has faced criticism.

This point too needs to be clarified. We have identified 28,847 government and aided schools with low admissions. We will not merge all of them. Only around 8,000 of the total 28,847 schools will be merged with 8,530 government schools.

There is no need for anyone to protest. I will meet all education experts and hold talks with them and clear their doubts. We will take all decisions democratically.

The previous Congress government had amended the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to make mother tongue the medium of instruction in primary classes. This budget announcement reverses that effort.

A total of 341 applicants had cleared the exam, which was conducted on April 15. While 220 students have secured seats, the remaining 121 haven't got admission. In Gurugram, 46 private schools admit students under the EWS quota.

On Thursday, parents gathered in front of the DC's house and staged a protest for three hours.

Speaking on the issue, DEEO Yadav said, ""We've told parents that many cases are under investigation. The ones who have filed correct documents will get admission. Private schools have complained to us that many parents are seeking admissions despite not falling under EWS quota and that documents which they have submitted are wrong or fake.

""We suggested that these activities be considered integral part of the school and compulsory. This should not be optional.

After a report in Pune Newsline highlighted how the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was indulging discriminatory practice vis-a-vis cash awards to SSC students from civic schools and private schools, the civic administration on Wednesday decided to tweak the rule and increase the prize money for meritorious students from private schools. Hundreds of meritorious students from private schools are expected to benefit from the move as now they will receive Rs one lakh instead of Rs 15,000, which was decided earlier.

On June 9, Pune Newsline had highlighted the fact that 18 PCMC-run school students who secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will get Rs one lakh cash reward while private school students within PCMC limits will get only Rs 15,000, a practice in force for past few years.

Civic activists had called for an end to this discriminatory practice. Taking note of the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad BJP president Laxman Jagtap, MLA had urged the civic administration and the standing committee to provide justice to private school students. As a result, a meeting by the standing committee was held on June 5, where it was announced that students from private schools who come under the below poverty line and have secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will also get Rs one lakh cash reward.

However, BJP leaders like city general secretary Sarang Kamtekar and PCMC House leader Eknath Pawar said they were in favour rewarding meritorious SSC students from economically weaker sections. ""PCMC should honour students who come from poor sections of the society and have secured more than 90 per cent marks. Like students who live in one room chawls, sons and daughters of autorickshaw drives and vegetable vendors,"" he said. Pawar said he too would take up the issue with the Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar.

When contacted, Hardikar said the idea was good and he would work out the budget for it. ""We will have to see how many students fall in the category and whether we are in a position to provide the funds. But the idea is good...we need to honour the poor and meritorious students,"" he said.

According to PCMC officials, last year over 1100 students from private schools had secured more than 90 per cent marks. ""These students included the poor as well as the rich,"" he said, adding that the figure of EWS students would be in the range of around 400.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

Recently, an 'unanimous resolution' on the letterhead of the Kerala CBSE School Management Association was submitted as a memorandum to Kumar and a copy was sent to member schools. The association has around 1,400 schools as members.

Signed by association president T P M Ibrahim Khan, the 'resolution' listed out recent 'actions' of Kumar which, if repeated, ""would adversely affect even the existence of CBSE schools in the state.""

The 'resolution' also interpreted actions taken by Kumar as ""creating havoc among schools, especially in Muslim minority schools.""

It said the RO's orders had ""created disappointment among the minority community.""

'Resolution unauthorised'

Ironically, the association's general secretary and working president have come out against the 'resolution'. Sources said they had asked the president (Ibrahim) why such a 'resolution' was prepared without the executive committee's authorisation.

Meanwhile, three of the four schools run by minority community managements, listed as 'aggrieved parties', are understood to have objected to the 'resolution'. It is learnt schools which distanced themselves from the resolution were opposed to being used as pawns to build a case against Kumar, who has an impeccable track record.

Strong action

Kumar had created a flutter when he inspected a school in Kollam based on widespread complaints. He proceeded fine the school Rs 2 lakh - the highest ever in the country - for poor infrastructure, unsafe classrooms and several other unfair practices.

Kumar's intervention ended several unfair practices by schools such as collection of huge amounts as 'development fee', charging fees for issuing transfer certificates, collecting 'caution deposit' from teachers, overcharging students for textbooks and conducting unauthorised exams.

Kumar ruffled a few feathers when he took action against a prominent school in the capital for conducting entrance coaching classes outside the school premises but promoting it on its official website. He also cracked the whip on an unauthorised association of school managements from the minority community which fleeced students and compelled them to attend 'talent search exams' having communally divisive content.

THE 'CHARGES'

■ Conducted inspections, created 'terror' in schools

■ Undermined the existence of CBSE schools

■ Created 'havoc' in Muslim minority schools

ACTIONS TAKEN

■ Fined schools found engaging in malpractices

■ Ended collection of unauthorised fees from students

Mahesh, who was making a point about how strict discipline, in his opinion, kills creativity, went on to compare students of such schools to 'parrots'. Praising government schools, Mahesh said teachers there are ""more intelligent than private school teachers."" After talking about teachers, the minister then shifted his attention to children, comparing those in government school to 'eagles'.

He was talking at an event organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) in the city to honour the 'Ambassadors' of old students associations at government schools. According to Mahesh, private school teachers act like nuns as they are very disciplined and serious.

""If you visit any private school in the state after 10 am, there will be pin-drop silence and kids will be waiting for the day to get over and fly like free birds. As the teachers at private schools are like nuns, serious and more disciplined, kids will also be serious and seriousness kills creativity,"" Mahesh said.

Comparing government and private school teachers, the minister said, ""100% of our government school teachers are more intelligent than teachers at private schools. The only problem is of co-ordination between teachers and students which is not happening and if that happens, our government school kids will overtake private school kids,"" the minister said.

The minister then likened private school children to parrots and government school kids to eagles. ""Private school kids will become parrots and government school kids eagles. Parrots just do what they are asked to do. But government school kids fight for their rights by discussing and fighting with teachers. According to me, those who are naughty in the classroom are intelligent and not the ones who just listen to everything in the class,"" he said.

According to the minister, those who studied at private schools will not pay back to society and they will only look for job opportunities abroad. ""Our government school kids will remain in the state, even if they become a teacher, constable or driver. They will give back to the society by staying here,"" he added.

private schools condemn comment

The statements by the minister were condemned by private school managements. The managements even demanded the minister's resignation for what they termed as ""irresponsible"" statements and for violating rights of the children by discriminating between government and private school kids. D Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said, ""How can the minister give such immature and irresponsible statements? e demand that the minister step down."""

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning. ""Students in private schools are like parrots and only repeat what you say.

He then went on to question the role of private schools in society, and claimed that they only contribute to the betterment of Switzerland, America, and Russia. ""Government school students, on the other hand, contribute to society by becoming police officials and taking up other jobs in our country,"" Mr. Mahesh said.

He commended government school students for their behaviour, and said they were hundred times more intelligent than those in private schools.

Private school managements have demanded his resignation. D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said they condemn the Minister's statement.

""How can the Education Minister make a statement showing private schools in poor light? His understanding of education is very poor and we urge the Chief Minister to change his portfolio as he is unfit to be the Education Minister,"" said Mr. Kumar.

He said managements were deeply hurt by his irresponsible statements which amounted to discrimination against their students.

'English only as a language in govt. schools'

Clearing the confusion over introduction of English in government schools, Mr. Mahesh on Saturday said English would be taught effectively only as a language in 1,000 government schools. The Minister said while English was already being taught as a subject in government schools, it would be taught effectively by recruiting more English teachers."

The decision was taken in a meeting on road safety, chaired by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, on Wednesday.

""Overloaded vans put children's lives at risk. We will not allow private vans to carry more children than the subscribed limit. We will run a special campaign to challan private van operators who flout the rules,"" Munish Sharma, additional deputy commissioner, said.

In line with its Surakshit Vahan Policy, there are committees at the state-, district- and sub-district levels that have laid down rules for ensuring safety of schoolchildren.

As per the policy, vehicles engaged in carrying schoolchildren cannot ferry children in excess of 1.5 times the vehicle's registered seating capacity. However, poor implementation of rules and lax monitoring has failed to keep a check on accidents involving these vans.

Sharma said 50 private van drivers of different schools had been issued a ticket by the Regional Traffic Authority in September alone.

The administration has also directed all schools to keep a record of details of vendors who ferry children. Information such as the driver's name, mobile number and number of children being ferried should be made available, the rules stipulate.

Sharma informed that the administration was keeping a check on underage drivers. ACP, traffic Hawa Singh , who was also present in the meeting, said that in the last three months, 135 fines were issued for underage driving in the district.

""We have told all schools to ensure that children do not travel in vans that are crammed beyond capacity.

Srinagar: While it seems the General Administration Department is trying to make strike calls 'a failure' by installing Bio-metric Systems in government offices in Jammu and Kashmir, some private educational institutions are also pressing the employees to reach offices on strike days, jeopardizing their lives.

However, the school admins deny the allegations saying the staff 'enjoys' holiday on a strike day.

Kashmir, which is caught up in a conflict as both India and Pakistan claim the territory and have fought three wars over it. In order to protest the 'atrocities of the Indian armed forces', the Joint Resistance Leadership, calls for shutdowns and strikes in order to send out a message to the world that everything is not right in the valley.

On strike days, the business and offices are supposed to come to a halt for the said dates. It only incurs losses to Kashmir and education is also a sector that suffers grossly. At present, on strike days, the educational institutions send text messages to parents asking them to keep their wards at home. However, the staff members are asked to come to the school.

""Whatever be the case, we are supposed to go. The authorities would try to keep us engaged with paperwork but we would really face hardships in order to mark the attendance,"" says a former teacher from a private institution located in Pulwama. On condition of keeping his and the school's identity anonymous, he also told Free Press Kashmir that the school would force the local teachers to come to the school and make them sign a contract so they don't claim the salary for the vacation time.

""On the days when we work, we work enough to deserve the salary while the school is shut. The contract they would make us sign would remain with them. Asking for salary or not coming on strike days meant termination,"" he says adding that he resigned from the school.

The teachers from Srinagar would be allowed to stay back home while the local teachers from the 'always on boil' Pulwama would be asked to attend the school with no students to teach.

""Pulwama is the area that is not safe to travel. When you leave home in formals, you send a message that you are not on strike which hurts the sentiments of those who are on strike. This is something that the school doesn't consider. We literally risk our lives for peanuts,"" says the tutor.

Moreover, teachers from Urban areas complain about the same, saying that they ought to attend the school despite all odds. While talking to FPK, a faculty member from Oasis Educational Institute said that the administration calls them to school even if they have to kill time just by sitting there.

""The students are sitting at home and we are asked to come. We keep sitting for the day but we are not allowed to stay back home. This not only puts our lives at risk but also frustrates us,"" said the member. The school authorities did not respond to the calls on the contact number provided on their website.

Another institute, International Islamic School (IIS) also follows the same line when it comes to going against the strike calls.

""The staff would not be allowed to leave early on Fridays, not to talk of the strike days. Even today, it follows the same lines,"" says a former employee from IIS.

While in rural areas, the authorities threaten the employees out loud, here in Srinagar the authorities deny all the allegations.

""The staff doesn't come on strike days. They enjoy the holiday at their home. In fact, we pay them for that day too,"" said the Public Relations Officer of IIS.

""When the call for the strike is not so serious, we do come to the school. On that day, we work on the maintenance of registers, hold meetings, check and update the syllabus, make activity reports. There is always something we get to work on,"" says Khawaja Irfan, a +2 lecturer from Tyndale Biscoe School, Srinagar.

""Even on days when we don't have much to do, we play matches and the time passes. On strict strike call days, we are asked to stay home but the non-teaching staff is supposed to come, come what may,"" Ifran says.

An official from the school told FPK that ""it doesn't matter to the non-teaching staff whether there is a strike or not.""

""We have nothing to do with the children. We have official work and that is what we are supposed to do even when there are strikes. So, we come,"" he says, wishing to remain anonymous.

What if it hikes the fees mid-year upsetting your already tight budget? No use protesting as schools have all the right to do so, if recent judicial pronouncements are anything to go by. ""There's no statutory prohibition for a management to fix a particular fee for an academic year and there's no guideline issued by the CBSE as to how the fee structure should be maintained,"" ruled the High Court recently.

This was in connection with a case in which parents protested the sudden fee hike by a CBSE-affiliated school in Ernakulam. The CBSE regional office has come across instances in which some affiliated schools in the state were found to have collected as many as 20 different types of fees.These included 'Computer Fee' from four-year-old LKG students and fees for conducting talent search exams of private agencies from all students.

CBSE school management representatives played down fleecing instances as 'isolated cases'. ""Most of the CBSE-affiliated schools are charging fees according to the facilities provided to students. It's unfair to cite a few cases and say that all CBSE schools are fleecing students,"" said Kerala CBSE School Management Association general secretary Indira Rajan.

However, frequent complaints on the part of parents have put the spotlight on the need to set up a fee regulatory body for unaided schools on the lines of self-financing professional colleges. Already, states such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam have enacted laws regulating the fee structure of private schools.

Government cites helplessness

""The state government had imposed certain stringent conditions as a prerequisite for granting of NOC to unaided schools with a view to bring in some sort of regulation over such institutions. But the move was turned down by the Supreme court,"" said General Education Secretary A Shajahan.However, the government's sincerity in the matter has been questioned by certain quarters.

""The government is maintaining criminal silence on the issue and has given unaided schools a free hand. If the government has any sincerity, it should urgently bring in a regulatory mechanism to prevent fleecing of students. But that requires strong political will,"" opined education rights activist M Shajarkhan."

Besides, she said, government school teachers gave more attention to students. ""Teachers give us extra time and attention -- we are sometimes called to school during holidays to study -- which is not the case in private schools,"" said Kumari.

Tough regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools must be eased as soon as possible.

Can launching 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings improve the situation?

The Narendra Modi government is seized of the importance of ensuring the ease of doing business in the country and rightly so. Since 2015, it has taken a series of concerted reforms to climb on the World Bank's annual rankings. The country's big jump from 142 to 100 in just three years is testament to the government's efforts.

A similar if not more urgent initiative is required in facilitating the ease of opening and running a private, unaided school. Though many may frown upon labelling education as a business, but this is all the more reason to show urgency in liberalising the norms and regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools. As India's middle class is expanding, millions of children are leaving government schools and opting for private ones. With time, this trend is likely to get stronger as more and more parents become financially empowered enough to afford private schools.

However, since the passage of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, ease of opening and running a school has become a nightmare.

On the digital and print pages of Swarajya, this writer and others have spilled enough ink detailing the ills ailing the RTE Act. We have repeatedly criticised the policy of keeping minorities out of ambit of the act in toto; important sections like number 12 that mandates 25 per cent quota for students from disadvantaged groups/weaker sections in private unaided non-minority schools; section 13 that bars any kind of screening for admitting students; section 16 which allows mandatory promotion to the next class irrespective of the performance and learning; and so on.

However, one important aspect of the act that has escaped the much needed scrutiny is the set of regulations surrounding the recognition of a school which is the fundamental requirement to run a school. Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE deal with rules and restrictions in this regard.

These state that no private school shall be established or run without obtaining a certificate of recognition from the appropriate government authority on fulfilling certain norms and standards as laid out in Schedule in such form and manner, within such period, and subject to such conditions as laid out in rule 11 and rule 12 of ""Model Rules Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

What are the norms and standards set out in the Schedule? First, the minimum number of teachers a school must have from classes I to VIII depending on the strength of the class. Second, the building requirements (kitchen, playground, number of classrooms, etc). Third, minimum number of working days in a year. Fourth, minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher. Fifth, use of teaching aid for each class. Sixth, library. Seventh, play material, games, and sports equipment.

What do the rule 11 and 12 of Model Rules say? After conforming to the above norms, every school has to fill out Form 1 declaring that:

the school is run by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force;the school is not run for profit to any individual, group or association of individuals or any other persons;the school conforms to the values enshrined in the Constitutionthe school buildings or other structures or the grounds are used only for the purposes of education and skill development;the school is open to inspection by any officer authorised by the state government/local authority;the school furnishes such reports and information as may be required by the Director of Education/District Education Officer from time to time and complies with such instructions of the state government/local authority as may be issued to secure the continued fulfillment of the condition of recognition or the removal of deficiencies in working of the school

Apart from these, there are eight tables of details to be filled in Form 1 such as:

Then the District Education Officer (DEO) carries out an inspection to see if the requirements have been met and give the certificate of recognition. However, it is temporary, to be renewed every three years and is only for primary classes i.e. up to standard VIII. For higher classes, there are separate, and similarly, those who run schools without obtaining a certificate of recognition can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 per day.

As if these onerous requirements, especially the ones highlighted, were not enough, it is pertinent to note that these are merely those mandated by the central act. The states have their own, additional level of requirements. Most prominent of these is 'Essentiality certificate"" aka the 'no objection certificate' awarded by the state government's Department of Education for five years.

Even by-laws of central boards like the CBSE insist on this prized possession as preliminary necessity before giving affiliation to schools. On top of all this, there are permissions and plans - building, health, water, land use permitted, etc - to be sought from municipality.

The situation is so bad that even elite schools with decades of reputation of delivering great service and education have to face extreme levels of bureaucratic red-tapism. Sachin Tendulkar's school Shardashram Vidyamandir wanted to amend affiliation board from SSC to ICSE for Class 1 to Class IV and also wanted to change its name. Both the requests were dismissed by BMC officials stating that it has given NOC for SSC board till 2020 so it must continue with the same.

If this is the condition for established players who can be treated in such a manner by a municipal corporation, one can imagine what effect they will have on genuine players willing to enter the field. The regulations can induce bouts of trauma into even the most spirited of edupreneurs.

The language of the RTE Act and other rules indicates that the State is more concerned with reigning in the growth of private schools than facilitating right to education for everyone in reality.

While the regulations provide for elaborate monetary punishments which can even lead to closure of the school for not getting the recognition, there is hardly anything about the government's laxity in giving the certificates. The Haryana government is yet to grant recognition for around 3,200 private schools operating since 2003 in the state. Without recognition they can't even apply to the Haryana board for affiliation. Wonder why no act penalises the government, say Rs 10,000 per day per school, for each day's delay in granting recognition (or rejecting it as the case may be)? Even if these schools are given recognition, it will only be for a year. The situation is similar in Odisha and Kerala too. The future of thousands of schools in the country, year after year, depends on government's arbitrary decisions.

Also, the government can announce any new set of arbitrary conditions as the Uttar Pradesh government did recently when it made it mandatory for all schools to install CCTVs and biometric machines for attendance to seek recognition from the UP board.

And if the schools protest, the government can pass an order ruling that agitating against the government can lead to withdrawal of recognition as the Chandigarh education department did this year.

Such a regime is bad enough for any business. It's disastrous and suicidal to have it in private education sector which is the only hope left for the lower middle class and poor to climb up the social and economic ladder. Every day we continue with this system, we are inflicting great damage to the students from the lower strata of our populace who are highly disproportionately enrolled in the failed government schools. In its zeal to put a leash on private schools in the name of curbing profiteering, what the government has achieved is monopoly of those who are now experts at gaming the system through underhanded ways and means. The genuine educationists and philanthropists dare not enter the market.

What can the Modi government do? For starters, it can launch national 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings. Second, it can reform the norms and procedures needed for recognition mentioned in the schedule at the back of the RTE Act. It can be done by a simple government notification as section 20 of the act mandates. There is no need for ratification by the Parliament.

To realise the goal of universal quality education, which is affordable too, the state must facilitate proliferation of private schools leading to competition. This will do more to curb profiteering than any fee regulation act ever could."

As the monsoon is not far away, local people allege the school is flirting with danger and risking the lives of its students by operating in a high-risk flood zone.

""The school is situated at the junction where an outlet channel of the Chembarambakkam lake and the Adyar river meet. This means if water is released from the lake, the school will be the first building to be hit,"" said O Udayakumar, a resident of Thiruneermalai.

According to locals, the entire area right upto the base of the nearby hill, which is, at least, one km from the school, was submerged in water upto the first floor of several buildings during the 2015 floods.

This means a repeat could completely submerge the school which is just a stone's throw away from the Adyar river and the Chembarambakkam water channel.

Interestingly, the school seems to have sacrificed 'safety for the aesthetics'.

The school buildings have been constructed right next to the river bank instead of the other extremity, which would allow some breathing space in case of emergency, though disallowing the picturesque view it boasts of now.

Though construction works were completed last year, this primary school began functioning only two months ago with a strength of 50 students and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

When Express contacted the school's management over the issue, they downplayed the risks the school faces from flooding. ""We have raised the floor two metres and will build a four-metre compound wall,"" said an official, claiming the school's basement has been sealed as a safety measure.

However, locals, who witnessed the flooding in 2015, said that no wall would stand a chance of fighting the raging water.

""Everyone just remembers 2015 because it is the most recent incident of flooding. At least, once in five years, there is flooding. It is more common than people think,"" said Udayakumar, adding that the monsoon doesn't even have to be as bad as 2015 to cause flooding."

Surprisingly, cocking a snook at police bandobast, the abductors committed the crime right under the nose of police and security personnel who were deployed in huge numbers in Saharanpur and Muzaffarnagar range due to the ongoing 'Kanwar Yatra' in the holy month of Shravan.

According to Badgaon police SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the Principal and owner of Paramount Convent School, Subhash Kashyap was abducted by four unidentified persons while he was on his way back home to his village Balu Mazra on a motorcycle at around 9 pm on Thursday. When he did not return home till late into the night, his family launched a search.

In the meantime, the family got a call from the mobile of the abducted principal. An unknown person was speaking and he told the family that the principal was abducted and he would be killed if they did not pay a ransom of Rs 2 lakh for securing his release.

The principal's family, in a state of shock and panic, rushed to Badgaon Police Station to lodge an FIR after receiving the ransom call. As per SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the mobile number was put on electronic surveillance and a search operation was immediately launched. The location of the mobile number was traced to Monga jungles on Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur border, said the SHO.

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

Safety and security of students, protecting them from sexual abuse, guarding the rights of children who perform poorly in academics are among the key features of a new Bill passed by the Tamil Nadu Assembly. Aimed at regulating private schools, the bill has been welcomed by parents and educationists alike. Wilful non-compliance of such mandatory features could attract imprisonment of up to a year or a fine that could go up to Rs five lakh or both.

The Tamil Nadu Private Schools (Regulation) Bill, 2018 was adopted by the assembly on July 5. It is aimed at ensuring aspects including assurance of quality education, collection of fair fee and proper conduct of examinations. ""No private school shall prevent any pupil on its rolls from appearing for any board examinations on account of poor academic performance,"" says Section 22 (3) of the Act.

Non-compliance may invite one year imprisonment or Rs five lakh fine or both. ""It is significant as some schools in the state have the practise of not allowing poor performers to sit for board examinations,"" said a parent, P Ravikumar.

All schools now have the mandate to ensure the ""safety and security of students including protection from mental harassment or physical injury or sexual abuse,"" as per sections 20 (1) and (2). ""These provisions are timely and laudable,"" said another parent S Arun, listing out several allegations of sexual abuse by teachers.

Given accidents like the recent death of a nine-year old girl after she fell from the fourth floor of her school in Chennai and some teachers allegedly resorting to corporal punishment, the new provisions will help prevent them, he said. General Secretary, State Platform for Common School System-Tamil Nadu, P B Prince Gajendra Babu, welcoming the law said a robust mechanism should, however, be put in place to implement the Act.

""There should be a transparent mechanism in every educational district to register complaints of students and parents,"" he told PTI. He said measures ""should be in place to ensure that nobody including teachers are victimised and justice rendered to all.""

He said the focus on ending unhealthy competition among private schools and stress on fair fee collection are praiseworthy. According to section 26, which reaffirms a 2009 Tamil Nadu Act, ""no school shall collect any charge...except the fee fixed by the Fee Determination Committee.""

Against the background of incidents like a student's recent death here after he was allegedly punished by making him to do ""duck walk"" by a physical trainer, the new law will help avert such incidents, the noted education activist said.

President, TN Private Schools Association, R Visalakshi too welcomed the law saying it will provide an impetus to schools in their endeavour to provide quality education. ""It will be helpful for promoters of new schools as well,"" she said.

Referring to sub-clause 7 of Section 8 that ""no child shall be admitted in any school which has not been recognised,"" she said a list of recognised schools should be publicised by the government. If a child was admitted to an unrecognised school, it attracts a punishment of up to one year or a fine up to Rs five lakh or both (for the unrecognised institution).

""In the first place, no school without recognition should be allowed to admit students. An up-to-date list of recognised schools must be featured in the education department website,"" she said. Importance for a ""judicious mix of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities,"" and learning outcomes are among the other notable features of the new law.

The school Bill was adopted after an expert committee came up with a draft legislation which considered all relevant Acts, rules, codes and government orders in this regard. The law applies to all private -both aided and unaided-and will come into force on a date the government will notify."

Kumaraswamy on Saturday made a promise that the State government would correct the budget announcement and ensure that English is taught as a language and not used as medium of instruction, Primary and Secondary Education Minister N. Mahesh appears keen to stick with the budgetary promise in letter and spirit.

In a chat with The Hindu, he said he was for opening English-medium sections in 1,000 government schools on an experimental basis to attract more students. Excerpts:

The State government's plan on opening English-medium sections in government primary schools has received a lot of criticism. Your thoughts on this?

We want to teach English as a language in all government schools. But we want to open one English-medium section in 1,000 government schools on a pilot basis. This is because government school enrolments are declining as private schools offer education in English. Take for instance a government school in my own village in Kollegal taluk. The school that had 200 students now has only around 40 as the parents, a majority of whom are daily wage labourers, want their children to study in English medium.

The decision of merging 28,847 government and aided schools with low admission rates with 8,530 nearby government schools too has faced criticism.

This point too needs to be clarified. We have identified 28,847 government and aided schools with low admissions. We will not merge all of them. Only around 8,000 of the total 28,847 schools will be merged with 8,530 government schools.

A delegation of writers, scholars, and academicians has threatened to stage a protest if English is used as medium of instruction. How will you deal with this issue?

There is no need for anyone to protest. I will meet all education experts and hold talks with them and clear their doubts. We will take all decisions democratically.

The previous Congress government had amended the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 to make mother tongue the medium of instruction in primary classes. This budget announcement reverses that effort.

I am not aware of the issue. I will study it and then comment."

""We suggested that these activities be considered integral part of the school and compulsory. This should not be optional.

This group has an average age of 10 years and comprises of Elon Musk's sons, children of select SpaceX employees, and a few high achievers from Los Angeles, studying in the most exclusive school in the city.

Post his children moving on, will he maintain his interest in Ad Astra? Or, will it remain a school for the already privileged children?While Ad Astra has kept a really low profile and Musk has never mentioned about the school, it will be interesting to see how the future of this experimental school shapes up."

The girl identified as Momula Adhya had come to the main road along with her mother, who was seeing of the girl's elder brother to school. While the mother was busy helping the boy to board the school van, Adhya came behind her crawling, which was noticed by the van driver. After the boy boarded the van, the driver started the bus, resulting in crushing Adhya under the wheels said the Shabad Police.

A case of causing death due to negligence was booked against the van driver and the school management. M Ravi Kumar, Sub Inspector Shabad Police station said that the school van though had all necessary permissions, it had no attender to take care of the kids.

Momula Chandrashekar Reddy and Lavanya, a farmer couple from Gopigadda village under Shabad Mandal, had two kids Satvik Reddy(4) and Adhya (21 months).

A week ago, Satwik was admitted to Sumedha Montessori School located at Shabad town in LKG. On Monday morning, when the school van no TS 07UA 0495 came to pick up the kids, Lavanya took Satvik to the van halted on the main road, located a few meters away in front of their house. Without their knowledge, Adhya crawled behind them. While Lavanya was busy helping Satvik board the van, Adhya also came near the bus and stood in front of the van near the left tire.

After Satwik boarded the van, the van driver Jangaiah aged around 35 years started the vehicle, not noticing the child standing near the front wheel.

""As a result, the child came under the front wheel of the vehicle and died on the spot as the wheel crushed her. There were more than 20 kids in the vehicle at the time of the incident,"" said Ravi Kumar.

As per the norms, the vehicle should have an attender to take care of the kids, but since the school management did not employ an attender, the school management along with the van driver is booked for causing death due to negligence.

The body of the girl was handed over to the family after an autopsy and the driver was detained for questioning."

During the current academic year, 203 students have taken fresh admissions to classes 1-9 at the Government Model Higher Primary School taking its strength to 736, compared to last year's 534. This apart, the nursery opened at this school last year has seen its strength go up from 86 to 203 this year.

What's more surprising is the government school is giving several private schools in its vicinity a run for their money. At least 25 students from four private schools have joined the government school this year, a trend which is rare elsewhere. So much was the rush for admissions that the headmaster had to convince people of neighbouring villages to admit their wards to their nearby government schools.

The turnaround of the school is attributed to the improvement in the physical infrastructure and quality in teaching. Six months ago, Ajit Kumar Rai, an industrialist and an alumnus of the school donated a three-storey building worth Rs 1.25 crore to his alma mater. Many other alumni also joined him to contribute their might to the school.

As a result, the school acquired the characteristics of a private institution complete with school bus, computer and science laboratories, library and English speaking course and extra-currucular activities like karate, music and Bharatanatyam. Sri Sathya Sai Annapurna Seva Trust provides breakfast to the students everyday. The school alumni who formed a committee have also recruited 11 teachers and three helpers and pay them.Headmaster Vishwanath Gowda said 125 students have taken admissions to class 1 this year till Saturday."

After a report in Pune Newsline highlighted how the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was indulging discriminatory practice vis-a-vis cash awards to SSC students from civic schools and private schools, the civic administration on Wednesday decided to tweak the rule and increase the prize money for meritorious students from private schools. Hundreds of meritorious students from private schools are expected to benefit from the move as now they will receive Rs one lakh instead of Rs 15,000, which was decided earlier.

On June 9, Pune Newsline had highlighted the fact that 18 PCMC-run school students who secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will get Rs one lakh cash reward while private school students within PCMC limits will get only Rs 15,000, a practice in force for past few years.

Civic activists had called for an end to this discriminatory practice. Taking note of the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad BJP president Laxman Jagtap, MLA had urged the civic administration and the standing committee to provide justice to private school students. As a result, a meeting by the standing committee was held on June 5, where it was announced that students from private schools who come under the below poverty line and have secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will also get Rs one lakh cash reward.

However, BJP leaders like city general secretary Sarang Kamtekar and PCMC House leader Eknath Pawar said they were in favour rewarding meritorious SSC students from economically weaker sections. ""PCMC should honour students who come from poor sections of the society and have secured more than 90 per cent marks. Like students who live in one room chawls, sons and daughters of autorickshaw drives and vegetable vendors,"" he said. Pawar said he too would take up the issue with the Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar.

When contacted, Hardikar said the idea was good and he would work out the budget for it. ""We will have to see how many students fall in the category and whether we are in a position to provide the funds. But the idea is good...we need to honour the poor and meritorious students,"" he said.

According to PCMC officials, last year over 1100 students from private schools had secured more than 90 per cent marks. ""These students included the poor as well as the rich,"" he said, adding that the figure of EWS students would be in the range of around 400. Officials said EWS families are those who monthly income is less than Rs 15,000."
