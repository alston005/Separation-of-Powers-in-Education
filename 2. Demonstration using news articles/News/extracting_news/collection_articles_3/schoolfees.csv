Had I not jumped out, I would have suffocated to death in the smoke. But today, I am really at a loss. The pain is unbearable and the future uncertain.

I am worried about losing the contract of making furniture in a south Kolkata home. The order would have fetched enough to pay the school fees of my four children and I could have given the rest to my wife to run the house for the next two weeks.

The doctors on Friday conducted an X-ray and suggested an operation. I am the only earning member of my family and we have no savings. My wife will have to borrow money for my treatment. In this situation, we won't be able to pay my children's school fees.

I am in immense pain. I don't know if I will survive or not. What is adding to my misery is that I am not sure how we will pay for my treatment. Doctors have said I will need two months of complete bed rest. Since I am a carpenter and my work involves a great deal of physical activity, I will need another month to be strong enough to get back on my feet and work.

If this is not done, says the letter sent by the school to the parents on Wednesday, the woeful state of finances could lead to the institution's ""unceremonious closure"".

""It was noted that on compliance of the DoE order, the school would be in enormous deficit, even if the basis of calculations of DoE, which though contrary to the Rule position, is accepted. This huge deficit might even lead to the unceremonious closure of the school known for imparting qualitative education for over six decades,"" said the letter sent by Bluebells School International, East of Kailash.

The school had planned to hike the fees to meet the burden of implementing the recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, but on August 1, DoE rejected the proposal after carrying out an audit. However, Bluebells claimed that DoE made an erroneous calculation of the institution's finances and the facts and figures submitted with documentary evidence were not acknowledged. ""DoE had been apprised of the adverse effects of the order. However, the request has yet not yielded any result,"" the letter to parents stated.

The school, which is sited on government land, maintained that the implementation of the pay commission pay scales in 2017-18, as per DoE's directives, had resulted in ""enormous additional"" financial burden. ""Hence, charging the fee on the basis of 2016-17, as per the (August) order, would make it impossible to pay salaries to the staff members, leave aside the payment of balance of arrears... and meeting other essential expenses in 2018-19.""

Bluebells has moved Delhi high court on DoE's order, maintaining that it does not need government permission to raise school fees. But with DoE yet to give the court its reply, there has been no relief on the front. In the interim, the institution wants the parents to pay their dues as per the provisional fee bills sent to them. ""The school has no other option but to issue fee bill on provisional basis for the ensuing quarters, i.e. October 2018 onwards,"" Wednesday's letter said.

Principal Sumar Kumar told TOI, ""The school stands by its assurance that the final judicial decision of the authorities or the honourable court will be adhered to. It is always open to discussions with the parents, but it will be impossible to manage at the earlier fees.""

The letter has stumped parents. ""The government should intervene to sort out the confusion. Even if we pay the fees, we do not know whether the school will refund the money if the court disagrees with the school,"" remarked the father of a Class V student."

Anil Garg of the School Bus Owners' Association told TOI that in view of escalating fuel prices, the association will write to all schools on Tuesday, informing them about the need for hiking bus fees.

An official from MSRTC said on Monday that there were no immediate plans to hike state bus fares.

The price of petrol rose by 31 paise and diesel by 42 paise on Monday. Oil company officials said price rise over two weeks has been mainly due to fluctuations in the rates of international crude and a further weakening of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar.

In Maharashtra, the price of petrol was highest in Nanded (Rs 88.05 per litre on Monday) and this was due to tax, mainly VAT, components, which are higher there. Mumbai continues to have the highest rate for petrol among all metro cities, sources in the oil industry said."

A division bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre dismissed a petition seeking a change in the law so that a parent aggrieved by a fee hike in a school can approach the regulator.

The Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act (MEIA) gives only the management or the executive committee comprising teachers and PTA representatives to challenge a fee hike order before the DFRC or the revision committee.

The court was hearing a petition filed by parents of a school in Khed, which had hiked fees by 25% for 2016-2017.

""We do not find that the law is one-sided or that there is a frustration of its object and purpose totally if parents do not have the right of appeal as guaranteed to the management,"" said the high court bench.

""Parents definitely have a stake, but they are given that legal status, respect and regard by placing them in the executive committee itself. The law is in that sense progressive for it entrusts the executive committee with important functions and directs them to be performed coupled with the duties to be discharged, which ordinarily could not have been discharged by these stakeholders. In several such laws, the stakeholders and the real ones, namely, students and parents, were excluded and kept out. In the present law, they are not excluded,"" the judges said.

Under the MEIA, the state has powers to regulate the fees of government and aided schools. In the case of private unaided educational institutions, the management has to place the proposed fee hike before the executive committee. The panel is headed by the school principal and comprises representatives of parents and teachers. If the difference between the fees proposed by the management and that approved by the executive committee is less than 15%, the amount finalised by the panel prevails. The management can file an appeal before the DFRC. Both the management and executive committee can file a challenge to the DFRC's decision before the revision committee headed by a retired HC judge.

The petition contended that the law was unconstitutional as it discriminated against parents, who did not have the right to challenge a school fee hike before the regulator. The court said that parents were included in the executive committee and had a say on the issue. ""The aggrieved parents, who are part and parcel of the executive committee, can definitely appeal in the event the management's proposed fees are upheld by the DFRC,"" said the court. ""When the executive committee fails to discharge its statutory duty and function, then it can hardly complain."""

Hiking school fees may become easier and representation of parents in the executive committee of the parents-teachers association (PTA) may reduce if the government passes the amendments proposed to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011.

Parents claim many of the amendments in the 11-page proposal, a copy of which is with HT, favour school managements. One such point is the right given to private school managements to hike fees, either through the approval of a PTA executive committee or by a simple majority of 76% of parents of school students, not necessarily from the committee, under ""unforeseen"" circumstances. Currently, the sanction of the executive committee is mandatory to impose a hike.

The document also suggests an amendment to the structure of the PTA's executive committee by reducing the number of joint secretaries from two to one, reducing the number of parents in it.

While the document is not out in the public domain, a member of the committee that drafted it confirmed the proposed changes. A government official, who is in the know of the issue, said deliberations over the proposed amendments were on and it has not been finalised.

Among the other amendments is the nod to allow schools to ask parents to pay fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. According to the document, parents will also have to pay 'late fees with interest', if they fail to adhere to the deadline given by schools to pay fees.

Parents are unhappy with the changes. ""The government is just trying to shield the interests of private managements by bringing in such amendments. If passed, all parents will oppose it,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents' Association.

In December 2017, an 11-member committee headed by retired HC judge VD Palshikar recommended that parents and PTAs should have more rights to handle fee-related disputes. Taking it into account, state education minister Vinod Tawde had said the government would work towards amending the Act in the following few months. The committee's recommendations did not include some of the contentious amendments present in this document. Despite repeated attempts, Tawde did not respond to the messages. Officials from the education department, too, refused to comment on the issue."

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

The state government has stated that it has the rights to further amend this list as and when required.

""We have declared the list for which fee is optional and schools cannot mandate the parents to pay for the same,"" said education minister Bhupendra Chudasama. The GR also stated that schools that have not submitted their fee proposal before the Fee Regulation Committee (FRC) should do the same before July 31.

The court had said that fee charged for such activities cannot be charged as part of the fee package. The court observations came during a hearing of the dispute between the Federation of Self Financed Schools and the Gujarat government over the state's new law, the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017 which was enacted last year ahead of the state assembly polls. Its stated aim is to regulate exorbitant fee charged by private schools and thus reduce the financial burden on parents.

Private schools challenged the constitutional validity of Gujarat's fee regulation law in the SC. The state government had insisted last week that private schools can't force students to pay for activities that are strictly not related to education or the syllabus. The apex court accepted this submission."

The NCPCR has recommended to the states a slew of measures like use of artificial intelligence and digital technology for regulation of school fees amid rising complaints of inappropriate fee hike against private and unaided schools. It has also suggested that states should form a committee in every district for such regulation, according to a child rights body official.

The fees of schools should be fixed using a suitable mechanism by use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, said Priyank Kanoongo, member (RTE & Education) at the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

The committees would be headed by district collector or district magistrate as chairperson and the fees should be determined for each school, he said, adding the panel would recommended a 10 per cent yearly cap on an increase of fees.

The NCPCR has sent its recommendations to the HRD Ministry. It also suggested formation of a parent-teacher association (PTA) who would participate in the fees determination of schools.

The committees would be formed under a framework developed by the child rights body.

The model framework is for private unaided schools which are 23 per cent of the total schools in India catering to 36 per cent of total population of children attending school.

The schools will submit a proposal for fee determination and those which fail to come out with proposals in the stipulated time period would be slapped with a fine of up to 10 per cent of the total revenue generated by them in the preceding year, Kanoongo said.

According to him, the decision to introduce a framework was taken to provide a preventive strategy against physical, mental and emotional harassment of children in schools resulting from mutual dispute between school and parents on fees related issue, he said.

Kanya Gupta, mother of a 12-year-old boy, said the inappropriate fees hike by private and unaided schools has been long bothering them.

Being locked up in the school basement a few days ago has traumatised her, the girl's father, Azam Ali, insists. There were 30 others with her, most of them kindergarten students, who were allegedly detained in the basement activity room for over four hours because they had not paid the school fees. The uproar over the lengthy confinement forced chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and area MLA Imran Hussain to visit the school on Thursday.

Irate parents took the opportunity to narrate their tales to the political leaders. On July 9 Mohammad Zulfiqar, who sells shoes at Old Delhi's Meena Bazaar, reached the school in the afternoon, as he normally did, to pick up his daughter. When he did not find her in her classroom, he was told by a teacher that ""she is in the basement room"". Zulfiqar is incensed that the school claimed he hadn't paid the girl's fees and said it should have enquired from the bank. ""My daughter asked me the following day if she would again be kept in the basement!"" the man muttered.

The CM and others had short discussions with the school principal and the parents. Sisodia later said that he had ""warned the principal"", and added that he has asked the deputy education director to prepare a factsheet on the issue and determine who was responsible for the children's discomfort. Police have already filed an FIR in the case.

There was, however, some support for the authorities of 44-year-old school on Thursday. Shamaila Jaffery, an engineer and alumnus, blamed the local media for hyping up the story. ""I am appalled to see the name of my school sullied,"" Jaffery said. ""Some people created a false narrative about the whole incident.""

Sania, mother of one of the children kept in the activity room, admitted that she thought it was odd to find her daughter in the basement and not in the classroom, but reasoned, ""The children were not locked in the room. They were allowed to go out for recess and to the toilet. In fact, my daughter was baffled to see other children crying around her. She was fine."""

The guidelines titled Model Fee Regulatory Mechanism are the result of a project supported by the Union HRD ministry. The framework prescribes a two-level process to decide fee in a particular school in any district every three years and it relies on technology.

According to the guidelines, fee in any school will depend on fixed and variable factors such as per capita income of a districts, inflation, depreciation, city allowances and facilities offered by a particular school.

""We are asking states to adopt a software factoring in all the inputs-constant and variable components-which will then tell them what fee will be appropriate for a particular class in a particular school,"" Priyank Kanoongo, NCPCR member (education) who has overseen the drafting of the guidelines, told The New Indian Express.

After the fee is thus decided, the school management will take it up with the Parent Teachers Association, which will have at least 25 per cent representation from parents of students belonging to economically weaker sections.

Other members in the PTA will represent parents of other classes and will be chosen through draws.Once decisions on fee for all classes are made, the proposal will be taken up with the district level regulatory committee, whose decision will be final, but the school management can take it to state appellate authority.

Schools not following guidelines will be docked part of revenue

Once decisions on fees for all classes are taken, the proposal will be taken up with the district-level regulatory committee headed by the district magistrate. It will have the district transport officer, district accounts officer and district teachers training officer as the other members.The state appellate authority, which school managements can approach if they are not happy with the district panel's decision, will have representation of secretaries of relevant departments.

If the school management wants to revise the fee before three years, it will need the approval of the state-level authority.The guidelines, which will now be required to be adopted by states, also say that schools that don't follow the norms will be penalised at 1 per cent of the annual revenue generated for the first violation, 2 per cent of revenue in case of a second violation and 3 per cent of the revenue in the event of a third violation.

Schools can be further penalised by being put in the ""no admission"" list by the district committee.There are currently no such guidelines for regulating school fees in most states, but in Madhya Pradesh the state government has adopted a technology-led process to decide the fees in some technical higher education institutes.Kanoongo said the need for coming up with such guidelines was felt due to thousands of complaints pouring in from aggrieved parents across the country.

Strict penal provisions

Schools not following the norms will be fined @ 1% of annual revenue for first violation, 2% for 2nd time and 3% for the third time"

The court ordered the Gujarat government to list activities undertaken by private schools for which payment is optional for students.

The apex court said that fees towards transportation, sports and other activities that do not form part of students' studies are strictly optional and cannot be a mandatory part of the fee package.

The court observations came during a hearing of the dispute between the Federation of Self Financed Schools and the Gujarat government over the state's new law, the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017 which was enacted last year ahead of the state assembly polls. Its stated aim is to regulate exorbitant fee charged by private schools and thus reduce the financial burden on parents.

Private schools challenged the constitutional validity of Gujarat's fee regulation law in the SC. At an April hearing of this case, the court told the state government not to question the decisions of schools to offer non-curricular activities to improve education standards, effectively pushing them out of the ambit of the fee structure to be fixed by the fee regulatory committee (FRC).

As this discussion was went forward, the state government on Tuesday insisted that private schools can't force students to pay for activities that are strictly not related to education or the syllabus. The apex court accepted this submission, said government pleader Manisha Shah.

Besides, the apex court has also directed 1,863 private schools to submit their proposals for regulated fees to FRCs in a week. Of more than 15,700 private schools in the state, 1,863 schools have not yet approached the authorities to finalize their fee structures, for various reasons."

In a shocking incident that took place in New Delhi, a school locked up 16 nursery children in the basement for 5 hours for not paying fees on time.

The incident took place in Rabea Girls' Public School in Hauz Qazi on Monday (July 9). According to the parents, the children were confined in the basement without food or water. The matter came to light when the parents returned to pick up the children, who are between the age of four and five.

""When we arrived to pick our children, the teachers told us that they had been locked up in the basement as we hadn't paid their fees for June. However, we had paid advance fees up to September,"" Hindustan Times quoted a parent as saying.

Other parents even produced receipts to prove that their children were harassed despite them having paid the fees.

Parents have claimed that the children were wrongfully confined and were mistreated. Reports have claimed that the parents have now filed a complaint about their wards being made to sit on the ground in hot and humid conditions.

""We rushed to the basement and rescued the children. There was no ventilation in the room and my child was crying,"" The Hindu quoted Fatima Begum, a parent, as saying.

""I dropped my daughter off at school around 7 am. When I came to pick her up at 12.30 pm, I did not find her in her classroom. I was informed by the school staff that my daughter has been locked up in the basement. I rushed to the basement where I found my daughter sitting on the floor. All children were confined in a small room under inhumane conditions with no fans and ventilation,"" said Mohammad Asif, another parent.

In fact, a news channel even showed some children crying in the ""basement"" where they were allegedly locked up.

However, the principal has denied the allegations that the school children werepunished.

""The basement is not a punishment place; it is an activity room where children play and learn music. It is a kind of classroom,"" said the principal, reported HT.

A teacher at the school said that the confusion must have stemmed from the fact that a teacher's slip, which is usually attached to the fee slip might not have been handed over to the teachers.

""There was confusion over fee submission as the school was not informed by the school administration. It will be clarified with the accounts section. Some parents have not submitted a 'teacher copy' to the school and it created the confusion,"" said the teacher.

Zia Uddin, a shopkeeper in Ballimaran, said that he could find his five-year-old daughter when went to pick her up from the school situated in the locality on Monday. When he enquired about his daughter's whereabouts, he was informed that the Kinder Garten (KG) student was sent to the school's basement as ""punishment"" for the delay in payment of her tuition fee.

""As soon as I reached there, I found 15-20 other girls with my daughter in the basement. It was horrifying. It was extremely hot there and the kids were sweating profusely,"" Zia Uddin said.

The parents alleged that the basement where the kids were kept had no window and there were only two ceiling fans, making the room even more ""claustrophobic"".

""We asked the school staff who then informed us that the children have been kept in the basement since 7 am and the door was latched from outside. We opened the door and saw the children on the floor. The room was hot and had only two fans. Most of the children were thirsty and hungry,"" the parents said.

""I immediately took the kids out and called the police helpline number. By then, other parents had also reached,"" said Zia.

The parents immediately went to Hauz Kazi Police station and filed a complaint against the school.

Despite several attempts, school principal Dr Naheed Usmani did not respond to the calls and messages.

The parents claimed that they had paid the school fees, adding that even if there was a delay, this kind of treatment of their wards is unacceptable.

""Even if the fee gets delayed, how can the school authority punish a 5-year-old like this. Instead of contacting the parents, the school confined the kids in that suffocated room for hours,"" Zia said.

Another parent, Mohammad Imran said that he could not believe when he got to know about the incident. ""It is inhuman. How can a school do this to little kids? My six-year-old daughter is traumatised. She is not ready to go back to the school,"" he said."

The school principal could not be reached for her comment on the allegations. However, in an interaction with a news channel, the principal denied the allegations that the girls were punished.

Many parents produced reciepts which they claimed were of fees that was already paid. A news channel showed some children crying in the ""basement"" where they were allegedly confined.

The principal claimed that the teachers wouldn't have known even if the fees had been paid as a slip meant to be handed over to them hadn't been received.

""Each fee slip has a teacher's slip attached to it. If that slip is not handed over to the teacher, how will they know that the fees have been paid,"" the principal said.

The parents, however, contested this claim by saying that the date on which the teacher's slip is to be handed over is the 11th of every month. ""Why wasn't a notice issued to us in the previous week?"" a parents asked."

The students were kicked out of school in March and were Leaving Certificates (LC) with negative remarks, ensuring that no other school was willing to give them admission.

After the students and their parents staged a protest at the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) education department yesterday, the civic authorities have now formed a team to probe the matter. The team is scheduled to visit the school today. Meanwhile, the mayor has also demanded that the school's licence be revoked for its actions.

Parents say

One of the parents Sakina Shaikh said, ""We have been fighting against the illegal fee hike for a long time. Our children are suffering even though they are innocent. They were given LC because we did not pay the fee hike.""

She added, ""The school kept increasing the fees for two consecutive years, which is against the rules. We opposed this move, but the school did not respond, so we stopped paying the fees.

Father received leaving certificates by post; DyDe asks institute to reinstate them, not break RTE norms.

Siblings studying in Lion Club Education Association English Medium School, Dehu Road, were sent leaving certificates via speed post due to non-payment of fees. Their father alleged that he was willing to pay the amount, but the school refused to accept it. He now says that the institution was being unjust to his children.

Mehrban Singh claimed that he had paid the fee for three months, but was later told that the school took it as an outstanding amount and failed to inform him about the next payment. Without clearing the issue, the school also went ahead to send leaving certificates of a boy and girl to their home. The leaving certificates reached him on June 7, after which he approached the deputy director of education (DyDE). Subsequently, the regional education officer was instructed to investigate the issue. Also, the school was told, through a letter, to not remove the students. Despite this, on June 21 commemorated as Yoga Day, the school sent the kids home.

Singh's kids study in Class II and Class III. Talking to Mirror,the father said, ""I paid the fees for the next three months at the start of the academic year. The school considered it as the outstanding amount and sent a leaving certificate of my children through speed post. When I approached the school, I was told to pay a fee of Rs 18,000. I was willing to pay, but the school had informed the Thane Janata Sahakari Bank, where we usually deposit the amount, to not accept the fees. After the leaving certificate was issued on June 7, the DyDE sent a letter on June 14 to the school, asking not to remove the students. But still, my kids were later sent home.""

Talking about the issue, DyDE Meenakshi Raut said, ""After the parent approached me, I asked the regional education officer to look into the matter. No school is authorised to remove students due to non-payment of fees. At most, the school can charge for paying late or inform parents to pay the amount at the earliest. Removing students from school is clearly against the Right to Education (RTE) norms.""

Singh further said that since most schools have already started the academic year, it has become impossible for him to find another institution for his kids. He said, ""My kids are also scared now after they were sent leaving certificates and removed from the premises. The school should consider if a parent is unable to pay fees. In my case, I was willing to clear the pending amount, but was not given a chance.""

When Mirror contacted Savita Utekar, the principal, she informed through an SMS that the management will take a final decision regarding the students after conducting a meeting."

Queen Mary's School at Model Town-III was instructed by the AAP government to roll back the hike after parents had complained to Cheif Minister Arvind Kejriwal about the arbitrary fee hike in the school for the session 2018-19.

During a public interaction programme last week, Kejriwal has said, ""Our government immediately took note of the complaints. It considered the fee hike to be in violation of the judgments of the honorable Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court and also the directions of the Education Department,"" said a statement released by the Delhi government. The Education Department then instructed the school to withdraw the fee hike. ""The school obliged to the government notice immediately and withdrew the fee hike.

In a blow to parents who have been protesting fee hike by schools, the Bombay High Court has said school managements ""always"" have the liberty to cancel the admission of students in case of non-payment of fees. The High Court passed the order in a civil application by the city-based Zeal Education Society's Dnyanganga English Medium School versus parents who had refused to pay the increased fees. Until now, parents who had fought against fee hike by schools believed that their children couldn't be expelled as, they argue, the Right to Education (RTE) Act prohibited any such action.

The HC order, however, stated that in case students didn't pay the fees, school managements ""always"" have the right to cancel the admission. The tussle between the Dnyanganga English Medium School management and parents of students has been going on for a long time. In 2015, some of the parents had approached the District Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC) against the fee hike by the school.

Last year, DFRC termed the fee hike illegal and asked the school to refund the hiked amount to parents. The school management then approached the Bombay High Court and asked it to direct parents to pay the fees. However, the High Court has said that asking parents to pay the school fees was beyond its jurisdiction and it can't compel any parent to pay fees fixed by the applicant (school management). The court also observed that the school management has said the fee hike was introduced before the rules under the Fee Regulation Act came into effect, and the fees determined by school would not be covered by the Act.

The High Court has also given a stay on the DFRC order that had found the fee hike 'illegal'. ""If parents refuse to pay fees as determined by the applicant, which at the relevant time did not come under the purview of the act, the management cannot be expected to run the school without there being the requisite funds,"" observed the HC bench.

The school management has welcomed the order. Jayesh Katkar, executive director of Zeal Education Society, said, ""... Today, nearly one-third of 1,500-odd parents are refusing to pay... parents who are paying fees should not be made to bear the brunt of those not paying the fees. Now, we will send a request to clear all dues until 2017-2018 within seven days, so that we do not have to take any drastic steps..."" he said. Vinod Dharekar, one of the protesting parents who is also an advocate, said the parents were yet to take a decision on their next step. ""We did not expect this order and we will hold a meeting to discuss it,"" he said.

""When my daily wage is only about Rs 300, how can I manage to pay Rs 400 at short notice,"" asked Subramani (name changed), the parent of a Class VI student, who postponed enrolling his child.

He said most parents were not aware that government schools too charge fees, and added that he would try to arrange the amount in a few days.

The school charged Rs 200 from students who enrolled in Tamil medium, and Rs 400 from students who opted for English medium. The fee includes Rs 50 as fund for Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and Rs 150 as maintenance fees.

The school administration gives receipts for Rs 50 and Rs 150 separately but does not provide one for the Rs 200 they collect for English medium students, said parents.

Most of the residents at Kinathukadavu are daily wage labourers and their wage is not more than Rs 400 per day, said Siva Guru, a local resident whose neighbours postponed enrolling their children in schools as they had to save the fee amount.

""When the school did not give the option of paying the fees later, doesn't it mean the fee is mandatory and we have to pay immediately,"" asked Subramani. He said they did not want to escalate the issue as the school is the only option for their children to get education.

Citing that there is only one school in the Kinathukedavu region, P Mani, another resident, said the other options were the government school at Vadasithur, which is 7km away, and the government school at Kovilpalayam, 10km away.

Headmistress of the school Parvathi said parents could pay the fee later on if they are not able to pay immediately.

""We have fixed the maintenance fund as Rs 150 only after discussing it with members of the PTA,"" she said and explained that the school authorities had appointed a sweeper, a scavenger and a clerk with the PTA fund.

She said the school had to pay Rs 200 per student enrolled in English medium to the school education department. Instead of collecting it in the middle of the year, they chose to collect it during admission time.

Chief education officer (CEO) P Ayyannan agreed that the sum had to be collected for enrolling students in English medium, but he had not issued any circular to collect the fee immediately.

""The issue had not been brought to my notice. I will enquire into it,"" he added."

Data that's available online can help companies - particularly payments companies that already have a trove of user data - to make more informed decisions about loans, and issue credit in real time. It's been on the roadmap for companies like Paytm for long, and others like MoneyTap have been able to offer a line of credit up to Rs. 5 lakh - although the social indicators that it relies on still lead it to rejecting the majority of applicants.

At the other end of the spectrum, microcredit is gaining ground in the form of buy-now pay-later companies, like Simpl, or LazyPay, that give you credit in just a few thousands, to buy things online, pay for cabs, or order food. LazyPay is owned by PayU, which started as as one of the many wallets in India, but went on to become one of the bigger payment gateways here.

Last month, PayU launched a new service that falls at the other end of the spectrum, called Monedo, which offers loans from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000. One of the sectors where this has been very successful is education, where PayU Monedo has tied up with Byjus, Meritnation, Amity, and many other online and offline institutions. ""It's an EMI solution,"" explains Shailaz Nag, MD, PayU, ""If a customer comes to the website, he should get EMI on the fly, real time credit. It is available to people at the right time, at the right place, via PayU's distribution network.""

You could be shopping on an e-commerce website, trying to book your holiday travel plans, or paying your fees for tuitions via a service like Byjus, and PayU could offer to convert the bill into an EMI on the stop.

The goal is to target people who are served by banks but don't use credit cards, because India is ""debit card country,"" says Nag. ""Credit card penetration is very low, there are only around 30 million credit cards and over 800 million debit cards. So the banking population who can make use of EMIs in India is very low.""

Aside from that, many people with credit cards also don't want to use them to take EMIs, adds Gurjodhpal Singh, Senior Vice President and Business Head, PayU Monedo. ""Before launching [Monedo] we did customer research, and what we found is that the credit card limit for people is also quite low,"" he adds. ""People who are using the cards tend to use them for the household monthly expenses also, and if you take an EMI, then a big portion of your limit gets blocked on the card. So even consumers with a credit card are looking for other EMI options.""

The actual product is quite straightforward. If you choose the EMI option, then you'll have to enter a few details (and it could just be your Aadhaar number, depending on what you're spending on - more on that in a bit) and then get started, with a minimal four to five clicks according to Nag. The way it works is a little more complex.

Like LazyPay and the microcredit platforms we've talked about earlier, there's a lot of data about the user that's being collected here, and that might make people a little uneasy. PayU has tried to integrate this service with the different sites it's available on, and it uses the data that these sites can provide in order to work out how much of a risk you are, and what kind of rates and repayment periods it can offer you.

This data is also used to populate as much of the forms as possible, which is why Onboarding could require as little as your Aadhaar number and an OTP confirmation. And of course, PayU itself has a rich store of data on users which it can run through its algorithms as well.

Interestingly, in the month and a half that it's been running, the numbers are looking good for PayU Monedo, according to Nag. The loans range from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000, with the largest loan approved so far being for Rs. 92,000. In the last month and a half, it has disbursed over 800 loans, amounting to Rs. 2.5 crore, with the average loan being roughly Rs. 30,000, and while the company didn't share the repayment figures, Nag says it's done well. ""Repayment has been very good, and we're using machine learning to improve our performance, and to target better customers,"" adds Singh.

Nag is able to offer one more statistic which shows the importance your data holds for fintech companies. According to Nag, the acceptance rate for customers - on sites where PayU is getting data from the site - is 85 - 90 percent. On the other hand, on sites where PayU is not so deeply integrated, the acceptance rate plummets to just about 15 percent, he says.

And what do people use this for? There are two main uses, according to Nag. The first is education, as parents need to make hefty payments upfront, which can be onerous. But the other category, that's almost as popular? ""Buying mobile phones,"" says Nag."

The debate over school fee structure, in fact, had begun 150 years ago. But the unchecked commercialization permitted by successive governments has festered to a new high which the authority finds tough to control. Had the government paid any heed to the golden words spoken one and a half century ago and now lying buried in bulky government records, the situation would have been different.

In 1968, after an inspection of the existing schooling system in the Bombay Presidency, then director of public instruction, J B Peile wrote about fee hike, ""A fair and suitable fee raises the tone of a school; but an excessive fee degrades it, by making it the monopoly of a class.""

In the voluminous 'Report of the Department of Public Instruction in the Bombay Presidency' submitted in 1869-70, the British education officials rued a situation in which reducing fees in vernacular schools could not bring students back to school.

Educational inspector of the northern division (Gujarat), T B Curtis reported, ""The reduction of fee from one rupee to 8 annas, which took place in 1868, did not lead to any increase in pupils, and in all places except the large towns, this fee is still considered to be high by the people.""

He recorded that in 50 schools in different regions of Gujarat, net decrease of students studying English was 143 against an increase of 38 students in classical languages.

The reports of the public instruction department were full of discussion on how to collect fees and to what extent, and how much burden should the government bear.

Peile was of the opinion that at least one third of the cost of education should be borne by the community. But he felt that the fees in Indian schools were higher than those in other countries and advised the government to bring it down.

""Government can compare the scale of fees with those in force in other countries. I believe that the school fees are higher than those in France or Germany. The highest school fee rate in Prussia is £ 4 per annum, and in Switzerland £ 2-8. I hope, therefore, the government will come to conclusion that the public interests are sufficiently cared for in this matter,"" Peile wrote.

The report mentioned that hiring good English teachers required more money and people did not have the capacity to pay high fees. This led the department to take a decision to close English classes in Gujarat ""whenever they contained less than 15 boys paying an 8 anna fee"".

This situation posed a question before the director about the quality of education and he was clear that it is good not to have any teacher than to have a bad teacher. He wrote, ""It is the duty of the government to refuse to supply any but good English teachers, and, if the people cannot subscribe the pay of a good English teacher, to refuse to allow a bad one to teach in a government school."""

The division bench of Justice M N Bhandari and D C Somani issued the direction on a petition challenging the order issued by the district education officer (DEO) Jaipur-I on April 20 staying the fee hike affected by the school management.

The petition challenging the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) Act 2016 said, order dated April 20 is beyond the authority of the said officer since no such provision so as to enable such officer to address or direct upon any fee-related grievance has been provided in the Act of 2016. Further, the Act talks about the state regulating the fee collected by private unaided educational institutions, which is violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner to regulate and manage the petitioner school as guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India.

The petition contended that Vidhyashram School is a non-aided autonomous school. So the government cannot control the fee structure determined by the school management.

""The Act and the subsequent order of the district education officer are both irreparably harmful not only to the petitioner but also all the students associated with the petitioner school since if the petitioner school does not collect the fee at revised rates, it will not be able to incur the expenditure that is a result of provision of adequate infrastructure, facilities, appropriate remuneration etc.""

The Supreme Court also in an earlier order had upheld the right of the private schools to charge the fees according to the facilities provided to the students, it was argued.

The school management further contested that the fees committee which determines the fess of the private schools are dominated by government officials and the schools have little say in the decision. The petition said the fee committee is headed by the divisional commissioner and other government officials. Even the representative of the private school is decided by the government, said Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the petitioner. The matter has been posted for next hearing on May 1.

Court stays government order on banning pass books

Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court, while staying the order of the director of secondary education banning the use of pass books by students and teachers, issued notice to the director.

The single bench of Justice SP Sharma issued the order on a petition by Sanjiv Prakashan.

Director on March 13 this year issued the order imposing restriction on the use of pass books and instead use textbooks and also warned of disciplinary action against the violators of the order. The petitioner said it publishes pass books for different subjects which help the students in their studies.

The petitioner also said the director secondary education has no powers to impose ban on pass books. Besides, it contended that there were many other study materials published by other publishers such as One Week Series, Guess papers, Question Banks etc which were no mentioned in the said order. It said the said order adversely affects the business of the publisher which is not only discriminatory but arbitrary."

The parents said that they were forced to buy books costing Rs1,350, directly from the school which also made it compulsory for uniforms to be purchased from them, allegedly at a higher price than the market rate. Additionally, parents of students are being made to foot computer fees of Rs2,200 and late payment fees of Rs100, for which no official receipts are issued.

The complaint states that for the last three years, there has been a 10% fee hike every year, which was not approved by the parent-teacher association (PTA) executive committee. However, the school authorities, in their hearing with the parents, said that they would continue with the 10% hike as the PTA had approved it.

""There have been hearings with state education minister Vinod Tawde, who has also directed the school to lower their fee hike,"" said a senior official from the office of the Deputy Director of School Education.

""We have decided not to vote in the upcoming state assembly elections till education is made affordable for our children,"" said another parent.

On Thursday, when he did not return, I kept calling him on his phone, but there was no response. Later, I got a call from a police officer who said my husband felt giddy and was in KEM Hospital.""

When Divya reached the hospital, she learnt the truth. Sangle made around Rs 20,000 a month. Divya works as a maid and makes a tenth of the amount her husband earned. The daughters are yet to come to terms with the fact that their father is no more. ""They keep asking about him,"" said Kishore Malusare, a relative. ""We are now worried about the girls' education. The family no longer has the financial wherewithal to ensure that the girls are sent to a good school. With this tragedy, do we now have to enroll them to a municipal school?""

The HC further said that no parent can insist on admitting their children into a school which involves high expenses.

The ruling was pronounced by a single-judge bench of Justice Bharati Dangre while hearing a matrimonial dispute. The bench was seized with a plea filed by a mother challenging the orders of the Family Court disallowing her to admit her minor daughter to a school of her choice and instead allowing her husband to get the daughter admitted to a school of his choice.

The mother had shortlisted an international school in Borivali for her daughter while the father had selected a school in Bandra, which was near their residence in Wadala. The school chosen by the mother charged Rs six lakh per year while the one decided on by the father charged only Rs 85,000.

Having heard the submissions canvassed before her, Justice Dangre noted, ""There is a difference of approximately 7 to 8 times in the fees of the school selected by the mother as compared to the school shortlisted by the father."" ""It is no doubt true that the mother can insist on a good schooling for a child, but she cannot insist that it should be a school which involves high expenditure because necessarily, merely because the fees are high, would not make the school a good school,"" Justice Dangre ruled.

Raising slogans against chief minister Vasundhara Raje and Devnani, Khachariyawas said, ""Every day parents are protesting against the unjust hike of fees up to 30% by the schools but government is yet to react on the issue. They are acting in favour of private schools which will cost them dearly. The issue is serious and will become a big movement in the city.""

The guardians of Loreto Convent (LC) have informed that the school is hiking fees by 10% every year, while brandishing receipts of their wards, and similar responses are also received from their counterparts at All Saints Diocesan Higher Secondary School (ASDHSS), not to forget the other private run schools in the state, including the Pine Mount School.

In LC parents and guardians are alleging that the school is collecting ""uncountable"" fees under ""numerous"" heads and fail to understand why a missionary school has to charge such exorbitant fees. In the latter, they said that the school is charging hefty fees from its students in the name of implementing smart classes. Parents and guardians are fuming, why they have to shed the amount for the smart classes when it is the responsibility of the ASDHSS authorities.

As always, they said that the state government is found mute since there are no regulations, checks and balances from their side. ""Conrad Sangma is talking about work permits to labourers from across the border. Why is he not talking about his predecessor's and his own government's failure to regulate school fees in private and corporate schools,"" said angry parents and guardians of these two prominent schools in the city.

One guardian of LC informed that states like Gujarat have a ceiling cap of Rs. 1,250 per month for primary level and Rs. 2,300 for high schools whereas Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan, Punjab have fee caps besides Uttar Pradesh and Delhi are considering one.

""Why can't Meghalaya have a similar cap? If the government can give permits to mushrooming private schools then why can't the same government control student fees,"" asked exasperated parents.

Meanwhile, interesting solutions are coming forward from informed guardians who observed that no missionary/ private run schools in the state display fees on their websites so that it becomes easier for parents to know before they admit their wards in a school.

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), the nation's premier institute for management studies, is all set to hike their course fees this year. Nearly nine IIMs have decided to change their fee structure which is set to see a hike of around 5-17 percent for the 2018-20 batch.

The fee hike is reportedly due to higher operating expenses, faculty pay hikes and the infrastructure costs among other reasons. The top IIMs like Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, and Indore and newer institutes like Rohtak, Ranchi, Trichy, Udaipur and, Amritsar are the nine institutes out of 20 IIMs that are said to be part of the fee-hike, the Economic Times reported.

""Increasing fees is now becoming a compulsion for older and mid-level IIMs such as us. After the first 10 years, IIMs are required to generate their own revenue and sustain themselves through their own corpus. Faculty salaries go up, cost of messes goes up, hospitality costs, security, infrastructure, security goes up, thus necessitating a hike,"" Dheeraj Sharma, IIM Rohtak director, was quoted as saying by ET.

The students will have to shell out an additional Rs 80,000-2 lakh for their Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, depending on the institute. IIM Ahmedabad is set to be the costliest for students as the fees could go upto Rs 22 lakh for a postgraduate degree. IIM Bangalore sees an increase in fees to 21 lakh from 19.5 lakh while IIM Indore fees is set at Rs 16 lakh, ET reported.

Even the newer IIMs have joined the fee-hike bandwagon, as IIM Trichy fees go up to 14 lakhs from 12 lakhs. The institute director of Trichy, B Metri, claimed that the hike in fees is bound to happen due to the consistent quality of education that IIM provides to its students.

""IIMs have consistently been focusing on providing better quality education, many have international accreditations. Factoring in that, plus increasing costs, fees are bound to go up,"" Metri told ET.

According to management experts, the demand for good talents is high and the salary packages have also improved. While speaking on the hike, Narayanan Ramaswamy, partner and head, education and skill development, KPMG India told ET that it was the ""market that is determining the prices."""

Around 87 per cent parents from across the country said that the respective state governments had not been successful in regulating fees.

The committee has reduced fees by up to 36% of the figures proposed by the schools. Only in the case of DAV International, Ahmedabad, has the fee been raised by Rs 542 over what the school had proposed, for the HSC science stream.

The fees declared by the committee for 170-odd schools ranged from Rs 14,000 to Rs 82,500 per annum. However, several prominent schools such as Prakash Higher Secondary, Udgam School for Children, Delhi Public School, and St Kabir have not yet presented fee proposals to the committee.

Sources in the committee said that the fee structure has to be approved by the Supreme court. The next hearing in the Supreme Court is scheduled for April 18. Under the Gujarat Self-financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017, the government had capped annual fees at Rs 15,000 for primary schools, Rs 25,000 for secondary schools, and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary schools barring the science stream. For the science stream, the cap was set at Rs 30,000 per annum.

The government had stated that schools which wanted to charge fees that breached the limit set by the Act had to file an application seeking permission to increase fees. Other schools had to file an affidavit affirming that they were adhering to the caps.

The committee has accepted the proposals of 24 schools and has not changed the fees proposed. Officials said that in the case of the HSC science stream in DAV School, the proposed fee was Rs 44,458; but the committee cleared Rs 45,000.

The officials said that the committee has been consistent in reducing fees across sections. For example, in the case of Red Bricks, Satellite, the proposed fees ranged from Rs 85,600 to Rs 1.18 lakh; the committee fixed the range at Rs 64,200 to Rs 82,500. That's a 25-30% reduction.

Interestingly, many schools had proposed more fees for the secondary sections than for the higher secondary sections. For example, Global Mission International School, Godhavi, proposed Rs 51,820 for the secondary section and Rs 30,000 and Rs 36,000 for the higher secondary general stream and the science stream respectively."

In May this year, the Delhi government had asked three private schools to roll back their fee hike for the 2018-19 academic session. The order also asked the schools to refund the increased fee to parents without delay and warned of action if this was not done.

Kejriwal also attacked the previous governments of Haryana, saying that they failed to develop the state in terms of education and health.

""Every government, from Bhupinder Singh Hooda, Om Prakash Chautala to Manohar Lal Khattar, instead of developing schools and hospitals in Haryana, only indulged in corruption,"" the AAP convenor said.

At the rally, Kejriwal also attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government for the recent attack on him at the Delhi Secretariat in which a middle-aged man tried to rub chilli powder on his eyes and face.

""Khattar sir has been in the government for four years and he was not attacked even once. No other Chief Minister has been attacked like this but I have been attacked four times in the last two years,"" Kejriwal said.

Election for Haryana's 90-seat assembly is scheduled for late 2019, after the general election that will send 10 representatives to the Lok Sabha.

Following a petition filed by RTI activist Vijay Gopal with the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR), the national body directed the Hyderabad district collector to conduct a detailed enquiry to determine if the school was charging excess fees.

""The management of Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, is collecting ?100 as application fee and ?500 as registration fee at the time of admission, in addition to the school fee, which clearly shows that the management is collecting high fees from the parents in violation of rules and regulations laid down in GO Ms 1 and GO Ms 91,"" read the enquiry report submitted to the NCPCR earlier this month.

The report stated that the ""defensible explanation"" sought from the school management by the DEO was ""not satisfactory"".

""As per the GO, private unaided schools shall not collect any special/other activities fee from any other student except the tuition fees. But, Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, Secunderabad, Marredpally mandal, Hyderabad, is collecting tuition fee from all the students along with fees for activities, which are optional for the students as stated in the said GO with violation of rules and regulations,"" read the report.

The DEO has now decided to initiate action after seeking a final explanation from the school management.

""As per the Telangana State Educational Institutions Act, 1983, a school management violating the norms is liable for a minimum three years of imprisonment. While the irregularities have been determined, the school education department must initiate action to ensure that the parents don't suffer,"" said Vijay Gopal, the RTI activist.

Anil Garg of the School Bus Owners' Association told TOI that in view of escalating fuel prices, the association will write to all schools on Tuesday, informing them about the need for hiking bus fees.

Rising fuel prices may also compel travel agents to increase rates by 10% for private cars/buses hired for picnics and weddings, sources said. As for private tourist buses operating on inter-city routes, there is already a government order restricting them to charge only up to 50% more than MSRTC fares. An official from MSRTC said on Monday that there were no immediate plans to hike state bus fares.

The price of petrol rose by 31 paise and diesel by 42 paise on Monday. Oil company officials said price rise over two weeks has been mainly due to fluctuations in the rates of international crude and a further weakening of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar.

In Maharashtra, the price of petrol was highest in Nanded (Rs 88.05 per litre on Monday) and this was due to tax, mainly VAT, components, which are higher there. Mumbai continues to have the highest rate for petrol among all metro cities, sources in the oil industry said."

A division bench of Justices Satyaranjan Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre dismissed a petition seeking a change in the law so that a parent aggrieved by a fee hike in a school can approach the regulator.

The Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act (MEIA) gives only the management or the executive committee comprising teachers and PTA representatives to challenge a fee hike order before the DFRC or the revision committee.

The court was hearing a petition filed by parents of a school in Khed, which had hiked fees by 25% for 2016-2017.

""We do not find that the law is one-sided or that there is a frustration of its object and purpose totally if parents do not have the right of appeal as guaranteed to the management,"" said the high court bench.

""Parents definitely have a stake, but they are given that legal status, respect and regard by placing them in the executive committee itself. The law is in that sense progressive for it entrusts the executive committee with important functions and directs them to be performed coupled with the duties to be discharged, which ordinarily could not have been discharged by these stakeholders. In several such laws, the stakeholders and the real ones, namely, students and parents, were excluded and kept out. In the present law, they are not excluded,"" the judges said.

Under the MEIA, the state has powers to regulate the fees of government and aided schools. In the case of private unaided educational institutions, the management has to place the proposed fee hike before the executive committee. The panel is headed by the school principal and comprises representatives of parents and teachers. If the difference between the fees proposed by the management and that approved by the executive committee is less than 15%, the amount finalised by the panel prevails. The management can file an appeal before the DFRC. Both the management and executive committee can file a challenge to the DFRC's decision before the revision committee headed by a retired HC judge.

The petition contended that the law was unconstitutional as it discriminated against parents, who did not have the right to challenge a school fee hike before the regulator. The court said that parents were included in the executive committee and had a say on the issue. ""The aggrieved parents, who are part and parcel of the executive committee, can definitely appeal in the event the management's proposed fees are upheld by the DFRC,"" said the court. ""When the executive committee fails to discharge its statutory duty and function, then it can hardly complain."""

Hiking school fees may become easier and representation of parents in the executive committee of the parents-teachers association (PTA) may reduce if the government passes the amendments proposed to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011.

Parents claim many of the amendments in the 11-page proposal, a copy of which is with HT, favour school managements. One such point is the right given to private school managements to hike fees, either through the approval of a PTA executive committee or by a simple majority of 76% of parents of school students, not necessarily from the committee, under ""unforeseen"" circumstances. Currently, the sanction of the executive committee is mandatory to impose a hike.

The document also suggests an amendment to the structure of the PTA's executive committee by reducing the number of joint secretaries from two to one, reducing the number of parents in it.

While the document is not out in the public domain, a member of the committee that drafted it confirmed the proposed changes. A government official, who is in the know of the issue, said deliberations over the proposed amendments were on and it has not been finalised.

Among the other amendments is the nod to allow schools to ask parents to pay fees on a monthly, bi-monthly or quarterly basis. According to the document, parents will also have to pay 'late fees with interest', if they fail to adhere to the deadline given by schools to pay fees.

Parents are unhappy with the changes. ""The government is just trying to shield the interests of private managements by bringing in such amendments. If passed, all parents will oppose it,"" said Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents' Association.

In December 2017, an 11-member committee headed by retired HC judge VD Palshikar recommended that parents and PTAs should have more rights to handle fee-related disputes. Taking it into account, state education minister Vinod Tawde had said the government would work towards amending the Act in the following few months. The committee's recommendations did not include some of the contentious amendments present in this document. Despite repeated attempts, Tawde did not respond to the messages. Officials from the education department, too, refused to comment on the issue."

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

The list of activities include transportation, hostel, lodging, food facility, excursions or field trips, horse-riding, swimming, club activities, books, stationary and co-curricular activities not part of the concerned board's syllabus.

The state government has stated that it has the rights to further amend this list as and when required.

""We have declared the list for which fee is optional and schools cannot mandate the parents to pay for the same,"" said education minister Bhupendra Chudasama. The GR also stated that schools that have not submitted their fee proposal before the Fee Regulation Committee (FRC) should do the same before July 31.

The state government was directed to compile the list of non-curricular activities by the Supreme Court on July 11 as it ruled that charges for non-academic activities cannot be thrust upon students by private schools.

The NCPCR has recommended to the states a slew of measures like use of artificial intelligence and digital technology for regulation of school fees amid rising complaints of inappropriate fee hike against private and unaided schools. It has also suggested that states should form a committee in every district for such regulation, according to a child rights body official.

The fees of schools should be fixed using a suitable mechanism by use of digital technology and artificial intelligence, said Priyank Kanoongo, member (RTE & Education) at the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).

The committees would be headed by district collector or district magistrate as chairperson and the fees should be determined for each school, he said, adding the panel would recommended a 10 per cent yearly cap on an increase of fees.

The NCPCR has sent its recommendations to the HRD Ministry. It also suggested formation of a parent-teacher association (PTA) who would participate in the fees determination of schools. The PTA shall consist of one parent representative from each class such that three-fourth of members of such committee shall be parents or guardians, Kanoongo said.

According to the framework, after submission, ""the proposal will be analysed taking into consideration the variable indicators of expenditure and income (as given by the school in enclosed performas/forms/annexures including depreciation/loans/interests etc.) and constant indicators of the respective district using software/ artificial intelligence"".

The committees would be formed under a framework developed by the child rights body.

The model framework is for private unaided schools which are 23 per cent of the total schools in India catering to 36 per cent of total population of children attending school.

The schools will submit a proposal for fee determination and those which fail to come out with proposals in the stipulated time period would be slapped with a fine of up to 10 per cent of the total revenue generated by them in the preceding year, Kanoongo said.

According to him, the decision to introduce a framework was taken to provide a preventive strategy against physical, mental and emotional harassment of children in schools resulting from mutual dispute between school and parents on fees related issue, he said.

Kanya Gupta, mother of a 12-year-old boy, said the inappropriate fees hike by private and unaided schools has been long bothering them.

""I have other younger children and I can't be spending all the money on education of one. We have been contemplating of switching to a government school following the recent fee hike of 15 per cent,"" she said without disclosing the name of the school.

As per the procedure laid down by the NCPCR, every school will have to submit its fee proposal online by October 31 for the next academic session, following which an algorithm will calculate the minimum and maximum fee a school can charge.

Being locked up in the school basement a few days ago has traumatised her, the girl's father, Azam Ali, insists. There were 30 others with her, most of them kindergarten students, who were allegedly detained in the basement activity room for over four hours because they had not paid the school fees. The uproar over the lengthy confinement forced chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, deputy CM Manish Sisodia and area MLA Imran Hussain to visit the school on Thursday.

Irate parents took the opportunity to narrate their tales to the political leaders. On July 9 Mohammad Zulfiqar, who sells shoes at Old Delhi's Meena Bazaar, reached the school in the afternoon, as he normally did, to pick up his daughter. When he did not find her in her classroom, he was told by a teacher that ""she is in the basement room"". Zulfiqar is incensed that the school claimed he hadn't paid the girl's fees and said it should have enquired from the bank. ""My daughter asked me the following day if she would again be kept in the basement!"" the man muttered.

The CM and others had short discussions with the school principal and the parents. Sisodia later said that he had ""warned the principal"", and added that he has asked the deputy education director to prepare a factsheet on the issue and determine who was responsible for the children's discomfort. Police have already filed an FIR in the case.

There was, however, some support for the authorities of 44-year-old school on Thursday. Shamaila Jaffery, an engineer and alumnus, blamed the local media for hyping up the story. ""I am appalled to see the name of my school sullied,"" Jaffery said. ""Some people created a false narrative about the whole incident.""

Sania, mother of one of the children kept in the activity room, admitted that she thought it was odd to find her daughter in the basement and not in the classroom, but reasoned, ""The children were not locked in the room. They were allowed to go out for recess and to the toilet. In fact, my daughter was baffled to see other children crying around her. She was fine."""

The guidelines titled Model Fee Regulatory Mechanism are the result of a project supported by the Union HRD ministry. The framework prescribes a two-level process to decide fee in a particular school in any district every three years and it relies on technology.

According to the guidelines, fee in any school will depend on fixed and variable factors such as per capita income of a districts, inflation, depreciation, city allowances and facilities offered by a particular school.

""We are asking states to adopt a software factoring in all the inputs-constant and variable components-which will then tell them what fee will be appropriate for a particular class in a particular school,"" Priyank Kanoongo, NCPCR member (education) who has overseen the drafting of the guidelines, told The New Indian Express.

After the fee is thus decided, the school management will take it up with the Parent Teachers Association, which will have at least 25 per cent representation from parents of students belonging to economically weaker sections.

Other members in the PTA will represent parents of other classes and will be chosen through draws.Once decisions on fee for all classes are made, the proposal will be taken up with the district level regulatory committee, whose decision will be final, but the school management can take it to state appellate authority.

Schools not following guidelines will be docked part of revenue

Once decisions on fees for all classes are taken, the proposal will be taken up with the district-level regulatory committee headed by the district magistrate. It will have the district transport officer, district accounts officer and district teachers training officer as the other members.The state appellate authority, which school managements can approach if they are not happy with the district panel's decision, will have representation of secretaries of relevant departments.

If the school management wants to revise the fee before three years, it will need the approval of the state-level authority.The guidelines, which will now be required to be adopted by states, also say that schools that don't follow the norms will be penalised at 1 per cent of the annual revenue generated for the first violation, 2 per cent of revenue in case of a second violation and 3 per cent of the revenue in the event of a third violation.

Schools can be further penalised by being put in the ""no admission"" list by the district committee.There are currently no such guidelines for regulating school fees in most states, but in Madhya Pradesh the state government has adopted a technology-led process to decide the fees in some technical higher education institutes.Kanoongo said the need for coming up with such guidelines was felt due to thousands of complaints pouring in from aggrieved parents across the country.

The apex court said that fees towards transportation, sports and other activities that do not form part of students' studies are strictly optional and cannot be a mandatory part of the fee package.

The court observations came during a hearing of the dispute between the Federation of Self Financed Schools and the Gujarat government over the state's new law, the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017 which was enacted last year ahead of the state assembly polls. Its stated aim is to regulate exorbitant fee charged by private schools and thus reduce the financial burden on parents.

Private schools challenged the constitutional validity of Gujarat's fee regulation law in the SC. At an April hearing of this case, the court told the state government not to question the decisions of schools to offer non-curricular activities to improve education standards, effectively pushing them out of the ambit of the fee structure to be fixed by the fee regulatory committee (FRC).

As this discussion was went forward, the state government on Tuesday insisted that private schools can't force students to pay for activities that are strictly not related to education or the syllabus. The apex court accepted this submission, said government pleader Manisha Shah.

As many as 16 nursery students were allegedly confined in the basement of their private school in Delhi and were forced to sit there for five hours because of a delay in payment of fees.

According to a report by The Hindu, the Delhi Police have registered a case of cruelty to children and illegal confinement against the management of the concerned institution -- Rabea Girls Public School.

The irate parents then called the police and complained that their children had been wrongfully confined by the school's management. In the complaint, the parents said that the girls were forced to sit on the floor in hot and humid conditions.

The parents also alleged that the school administration had locked up their children for non-payment of fees, despite the fees having been paid.

They reportedly claimed that they had paid the fees on time, but that the school administration refused to accept it even when they produced a receipt for the fees paid.

Delhi Police have assured that they are looking for the person responsible for the incident.

In addition to this, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) has set up an enquiry team comprising two of the Commission's ""ablest officers"", which will visit the school on Wednesday.The announcement was made on Twitter by DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, who added that there was ""zero tolerance of violation of dignity of children"".

In a shocking incident that took place in New Delhi, a school locked up 16 nursery children in the basement for 5 hours for not paying fees on time.

The incident took place in Rabea Girls' Public School in Hauz Qazi on Monday (July 9). According to the parents, the children were confined in the basement without food or water. The matter came to light when the parents returned to pick up the children, who are between the age of four and five.

""When we arrived to pick our children, the teachers told us that they had been locked up in the basement as we hadn't paid their fees for June. However, we had paid advance fees up to September,"" Hindustan Times quoted a parent as saying.

Other parents even produced receipts to prove that their children were harassed despite them having paid the fees.

Parents have claimed that the children were wrongfully confined and were mistreated. Reports have claimed that the parents have now filed a complaint about their wards being made to sit on the ground in hot and humid conditions.

""We rushed to the basement and rescued the children. There was no ventilation in the room and my child was crying,"" The Hindu quoted Fatima Begum, a parent, as saying.

""I dropped my daughter off at school around 7 am. When I came to pick her up at 12.30 pm, I did not find her in her classroom. I was informed by the school staff that my daughter has been locked up in the basement. I rushed to the basement where I found my daughter sitting on the floor. All children were confined in a small room under inhumane conditions with no fans and ventilation,"" said Mohammad Asif, another parent.

In fact, a news channel even showed some children crying in the ""basement"" where they were allegedly locked up.

However, the principal has denied the allegations that the school children werepunished.

""The basement is not a punishment place; it is an activity room where children play and learn music. It is a kind of classroom,"" said the principal, reported HT.

A teacher at the school said that the confusion must have stemmed from the fact that a teacher's slip, which is usually attached to the fee slip might not have been handed over to the teachers.

""There was confusion over fee submission as the school was not informed by the school administration. It will be clarified with the accounts section. Some parents have not submitted a 'teacher copy' to the school and it created the confusion,"" said the teacher.

The students were kicked out of school in March and were Leaving Certificates (LC) with negative remarks, ensuring that no other school was willing to give them admission.

After the students and their parents staged a protest at the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) education department yesterday, the civic authorities have now formed a team to probe the matter. The team is scheduled to visit the school today. Meanwhile, the mayor has also demanded that the school's licence be revoked for its actions.

Parents say

One of the parents Sakina Shaikh said, ""We have been fighting against the illegal fee hike for a long time. Our children are suffering even though they are innocent. They were given LC because we did not pay the fee hike.""

She added, ""The school kept increasing the fees for two consecutive years, which is against the rules. We opposed this move, but the school did not respond, so we stopped paying the fees.

Father received leaving certificates by post; DyDe asks institute to reinstate them, not break RTE norms.

Siblings studying in Lion Club Education Association English Medium School, Dehu Road, were sent leaving certificates via speed post due to non-payment of fees. Their father alleged that he was willing to pay the amount, but the school refused to accept it. He now says that the institution was being unjust to his children.

Mehrban Singh claimed that he had paid the fee for three months, but was later told that the school took it as an outstanding amount and failed to inform him about the next payment. Without clearing the issue, the school also went ahead to send leaving certificates of a boy and girl to their home. The leaving certificates reached him on June 7, after which he approached the deputy director of education (DyDE). Subsequently, the regional education officer was instructed to investigate the issue. Also, the school was told, through a letter, to not remove the students. Despite this, on June 21 commemorated as Yoga Day, the school sent the kids home.

Singh's kids study in Class II and Class III. Talking to Mirror,the father said, ""I paid the fees for the next three months at the start of the academic year. The school considered it as the outstanding amount and sent a leaving certificate of my children through speed post. When I approached the school, I was told to pay a fee of Rs 18,000. I was willing to pay, but the school had informed the Thane Janata Sahakari Bank, where we usually deposit the amount, to not accept the fees. After the leaving certificate was issued on June 7, the DyDE sent a letter on June 14 to the school, asking not to remove the students. But still, my kids were later sent home.""

Talking about the issue, DyDE Meenakshi Raut said, ""After the parent approached me, I asked the regional education officer to look into the matter. No school is authorised to remove students due to non-payment of fees. At most, the school can charge for paying late or inform parents to pay the amount at the earliest. Removing students from school is clearly against the Right to Education (RTE) norms.""

Singh further said that since most schools have already started the academic year, it has become impossible for him to find another institution for his kids. He said, ""My kids are also scared now after they were sent leaving certificates and removed from the premises. The school should consider if a parent is unable to pay fees. In my case, I was willing to clear the pending amount, but was not given a chance.""

When Mirror contacted Savita Utekar, the principal, she informed through an SMS that the management will take a final decision regarding the students after conducting a meeting."

In a blow to parents who have been protesting fee hike by schools, the Bombay High Court has said school managements ""always"" have the liberty to cancel the admission of students in case of non-payment of fees. The High Court passed the order in a civil application by the city-based Zeal Education Society's Dnyanganga English Medium School versus parents who had refused to pay the increased fees. Until now, parents who had fought against fee hike by schools believed that their children couldn't be expelled as, they argue, the Right to Education (RTE) Act prohibited any such action.

The HC order, however, stated that in case students didn't pay the fees, school managements ""always"" have the right to cancel the admission. The tussle between the Dnyanganga English Medium School management and parents of students has been going on for a long time. In 2015, some of the parents had approached the District Fee Regulatory Committee (DFRC) against the fee hike by the school.

Last year, DFRC termed the fee hike illegal and asked the school to refund the hiked amount to parents. The school management then approached the Bombay High Court and asked it to direct parents to pay the fees. However, the High Court has said that asking parents to pay the school fees was beyond its jurisdiction and it can't compel any parent to pay fees fixed by the applicant (school management). The court also observed that the school management has said the fee hike was introduced before the rules under the Fee Regulation Act came into effect, and the fees determined by school would not be covered by the Act.

The High Court has also given a stay on the DFRC order that had found the fee hike 'illegal'. ""If parents refuse to pay fees as determined by the applicant, which at the relevant time did not come under the purview of the act, the management cannot be expected to run the school without there being the requisite funds,"" observed the HC bench.

The school management has welcomed the order. Jayesh Katkar, executive director of Zeal Education Society, said, ""... Today, nearly one-third of 1,500-odd parents are refusing to pay... parents who are paying fees should not be made to bear the brunt of those not paying the fees. Now, we will send a request to clear all dues until 2017-2018 within seven days, so that we do not have to take any drastic steps..."" he said. Vinod Dharekar, one of the protesting parents who is also an advocate, said the parents were yet to take a decision on their next step. ""We did not expect this order and we will hold a meeting to discuss it,"" he said.

He said most parents were not aware that government schools too charge fees, and added that he would try to arrange the amount in a few days.

The school charged Rs 200 from students who enrolled in Tamil medium, and Rs 400 from students who opted for English medium. The fee includes Rs 50 as fund for Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and Rs 150 as maintenance fees.

The school administration gives receipts for Rs 50 and Rs 150 separately but does not provide one for the Rs 200 they collect for English medium students, said parents.

Most of the residents at Kinathukadavu are daily wage labourers and their wage is not more than Rs 400 per day, said Siva Guru, a local resident whose neighbours postponed enrolling their children in schools as they had to save the fee amount.

""When the school did not give the option of paying the fees later, doesn't it mean the fee is mandatory and we have to pay immediately,"" asked Subramani. He said they did not want to escalate the issue as the school is the only option for their children to get education.

Citing that there is only one school in the Kinathukedavu region, P Mani, another resident, said the other options were the government school at Vadasithur, which is 7km away, and the government school at Kovilpalayam, 10km away.

Headmistress of the school Parvathi said parents could pay the fee later on if they are not able to pay immediately.

""We have fixed the maintenance fund as Rs 150 only after discussing it with members of the PTA,"" she said and explained that the school authorities had appointed a sweeper, a scavenger and a clerk with the PTA fund.

She said the school had to pay Rs 200 per student enrolled in English medium to the school education department. Instead of collecting it in the middle of the year, they chose to collect it during admission time.

Chief education officer (CEO) P Ayyannan agreed that the sum had to be collected for enrolling students in English medium, but he had not issued any circular to collect the fee immediately.

Data that's available online can help companies - particularly payments companies that already have a trove of user data - to make more informed decisions about loans, and issue credit in real time. It's been on the roadmap for companies like Paytm for long, and others like MoneyTap have been able to offer a line of credit up to Rs. 5 lakh - although the social indicators that it relies on still lead it to rejecting the majority of applicants.

At the other end of the spectrum, microcredit is gaining ground in the form of buy-now pay-later companies, like Simpl, or LazyPay, that give you credit in just a few thousands, to buy things online, pay for cabs, or order food. LazyPay is owned by PayU, which started as as one of the many wallets in India, but went on to become one of the bigger payment gateways here.

Last month, PayU launched a new service that falls at the other end of the spectrum, called Monedo, which offers loans from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000. One of the sectors where this has been very successful is education, where PayU Monedo has tied up with Byjus, Meritnation, Amity, and many other online and offline institutions. ""It's an EMI solution,"" explains Shailaz Nag, MD, PayU, ""If a customer comes to the website, he should get EMI on the fly, real time credit. It is available to people at the right time, at the right place, via PayU's distribution network.""

You could be shopping on an e-commerce website, trying to book your holiday travel plans, or paying your fees for tuitions via a service like Byjus, and PayU could offer to convert the bill into an EMI on the stop.

The goal is to target people who are served by banks but don't use credit cards, because India is ""debit card country,"" says Nag. ""Credit card penetration is very low, there are only around 30 million credit cards and over 800 million debit cards. So the banking population who can make use of EMIs in India is very low.""

Aside from that, many people with credit cards also don't want to use them to take EMIs, adds Gurjodhpal Singh, Senior Vice President and Business Head, PayU Monedo. ""Before launching [Monedo] we did customer research, and what we found is that the credit card limit for people is also quite low,"" he adds. ""People who are using the cards tend to use them for the household monthly expenses also, and if you take an EMI, then a big portion of your limit gets blocked on the card. So even consumers with a credit card are looking for other EMI options.""

The actual product is quite straightforward. If you choose the EMI option, then you'll have to enter a few details (and it could just be your Aadhaar number, depending on what you're spending on - more on that in a bit) and then get started, with a minimal four to five clicks according to Nag. The way it works is a little more complex.

Like LazyPay and the microcredit platforms we've talked about earlier, there's a lot of data about the user that's being collected here, and that might make people a little uneasy. PayU has tried to integrate this service with the different sites it's available on, and it uses the data that these sites can provide in order to work out how much of a risk you are, and what kind of rates and repayment periods it can offer you.

This data is also used to populate as much of the forms as possible, which is why Onboarding could require as little as your Aadhaar number and an OTP confirmation. And of course, PayU itself has a rich store of data on users which it can run through its algorithms as well.

Interestingly, in the month and a half that it's been running, the numbers are looking good for PayU Monedo, according to Nag. The loans range from Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 100,000, with the largest loan approved so far being for Rs. 92,000. In the last month and a half, it has disbursed over 800 loans, amounting to Rs. 2.5 crore, with the average loan being roughly Rs. 30,000, and while the company didn't share the repayment figures, Nag says it's done well. ""Repayment has been very good, and we're using machine learning to improve our performance, and to target better customers,"" adds Singh.

Nag is able to offer one more statistic which shows the importance your data holds for fintech companies. According to Nag, the acceptance rate for customers - on sites where PayU is getting data from the site - is 85 - 90 percent. On the other hand, on sites where PayU is not so deeply integrated, the acceptance rate plummets to just about 15 percent, he says.

And what do people use this for? There are two main uses, according to Nag. The first is education, as parents need to make hefty payments upfront, which can be onerous. But the other category, that's almost as popular? ""Buying mobile phones,"" says Nag."

The debate over school fee structure, in fact, had begun 150 years ago. But the unchecked commercialization permitted by successive governments has festered to a new high which the authority finds tough to control. Had the government paid any heed to the golden words spoken one and a half century ago and now lying buried in bulky government records, the situation would have been different.

In 1968, after an inspection of the existing schooling system in the Bombay Presidency, then director of public instruction, J B Peile wrote about fee hike, ""A fair and suitable fee raises the tone of a school; but an excessive fee degrades it, by making it the monopoly of a class.""

In the voluminous 'Report of the Department of Public Instruction in the Bombay Presidency' submitted in 1869-70, the British education officials rued a situation in which reducing fees in vernacular schools could not bring students back to school.

Educational inspector of the northern division (Gujarat), T B Curtis reported, ""The reduction of fee from one rupee to 8 annas, which took place in 1868, did not lead to any increase in pupils, and in all places except the large towns, this fee is still considered to be high by the people.""

He recorded that in 50 schools in different regions of Gujarat, net decrease of students studying English was 143 against an increase of 38 students in classical languages.

The reports of the public instruction department were full of discussion on how to collect fees and to what extent, and how much burden should the government bear.

Peile was of the opinion that at least one third of the cost of education should be borne by the community. But he felt that the fees in Indian schools were higher than those in other countries and advised the government to bring it down.

""Government can compare the scale of fees with those in force in other countries. I believe that the school fees are higher than those in France or Germany. The highest school fee rate in Prussia is £ 4 per annum, and in Switzerland £ 2-8. I hope, therefore, the government will come to conclusion that the public interests are sufficiently cared for in this matter,"" Peile wrote.

The report mentioned that hiring good English teachers required more money and people did not have the capacity to pay high fees. This led the department to take a decision to close English classes in Gujarat ""whenever they contained less than 15 boys paying an 8 anna fee"".

This situation posed a question before the director about the quality of education and he was clear that it is good not to have any teacher than to have a bad teacher. He wrote, ""It is the duty of the government to refuse to supply any but good English teachers, and, if the people cannot subscribe the pay of a good English teacher, to refuse to allow a bad one to teach in a government school."""

The division bench of Justice M N Bhandari and D C Somani issued the direction on a petition challenging the order issued by the district education officer (DEO) Jaipur-I on April 20 staying the fee hike affected by the school management.

The petition challenging the Rajasthan Schools (Regulation of Fee) Act 2016 said, order dated April 20 is beyond the authority of the said officer since no such provision so as to enable such officer to address or direct upon any fee-related grievance has been provided in the Act of 2016. Further, the Act talks about the state regulating the fee collected by private unaided educational institutions, which is violation of the fundamental right of the petitioner to regulate and manage the petitioner school as guaranteed under Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution of India.

The petition contended that Vidhyashram School is a non-aided autonomous school. So the government cannot control the fee structure determined by the school management.

""The Act and the subsequent order of the district education officer are both irreparably harmful not only to the petitioner but also all the students associated with the petitioner school since if the petitioner school does not collect the fee at revised rates, it will not be able to incur the expenditure that is a result of provision of adequate infrastructure, facilities, appropriate remuneration etc.""

The Supreme Court also in an earlier order had upheld the right of the private schools to charge the fees according to the facilities provided to the students, it was argued.

The school management further contested that the fees committee which determines the fess of the private schools are dominated by government officials and the schools have little say in the decision. The petition said the fee committee is headed by the divisional commissioner and other government officials. Even the representative of the private school is decided by the government, said Prateek Kasliwal, counsel for the petitioner. The matter has been posted for next hearing on May 1.

Court stays government order on banning pass books

Jaipur: The Rajasthan High Court, while staying the order of the director of secondary education banning the use of pass books by students and teachers, issued notice to the director.

The single bench of Justice SP Sharma issued the order on a petition by Sanjiv Prakashan.

Director on March 13 this year issued the order imposing restriction on the use of pass books and instead use textbooks and also warned of disciplinary action against the violators of the order. The petitioner said it publishes pass books for different subjects which help the students in their studies.

The petitioner also said the director secondary education has no powers to impose ban on pass books. Besides, it contended that there were many other study materials published by other publishers such as One Week Series, Guess papers, Question Banks etc which were no mentioned in the said order. It said the said order adversely affects the business of the publisher which is not only discriminatory but arbitrary."

The parents said that they were forced to buy books costing Rs1,350, directly from the school which also made it compulsory for uniforms to be purchased from them, allegedly at a higher price than the market rate. Additionally, parents of students are being made to foot computer fees of Rs2,200 and late payment fees of Rs100, for which no official receipts are issued.

""Last year's Class 1 fee was Rs40,625, whereas, this year the school authorities are demanding Rs56,200 which includes admission fee of Rs3,600. This is a 38% rise compared to last year,"" said one parent.

The complaint states that for the last three years, there has been a 10% fee hike every year, which was not approved by the parent-teacher association (PTA) executive committee. However, the school authorities, in their hearing with the parents, said that they would continue with the 10% hike as the PTA had approved it.

""There have been hearings with state education minister Vinod Tawde, who has also directed the school to lower their fee hike,"" said a senior official from the office of the Deputy Director of School Education.

""We have decided not to vote in the upcoming state assembly elections till education is made affordable for our children,"" said another parent.

The parents have complained that the school has not provided them the breakup of the fee structure yet.

""By asking the parents not to believe the media or activists, the school has attacked the integrity of the press and activists working in the field of education. The parents, who have admitted their wards in the schools, have complained that the school is charging more than it has mentioned on its website and that they have not received any breakup of the fee structure. It cannot hike the fee since it is on government land and the court has currently put a stay on any such increase till further orders,"" said Mr Vohra."

IIM students are set to pay more for their degrees due to a price hike [Representational Image]Reuters

Indian Institute of Management (IIM), the nation's premier institute for management studies, is all set to hike their course fees this year. Nearly nine IIMs have decided to change their fee structure which is set to see a hike of around 5-17 percent for the 2018-20 batch.

The fee hike is reportedly due to higher operating expenses, faculty pay hikes and the infrastructure costs among other reasons. The top IIMs like Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, and Indore and newer institutes like Rohtak, Ranchi, Trichy, Udaipur and, Amritsar are the nine institutes out of 20 IIMs that are said to be part of the fee-hike, the Economic Times reported.

""Increasing fees is now becoming a compulsion for older and mid-level IIMs such as us. After the first 10 years, IIMs are required to generate their own revenue and sustain themselves through their own corpus. Faculty salaries go up, cost of messes goes up, hospitality costs, security, infrastructure, security goes up, thus necessitating a hike,"" Dheeraj Sharma, IIM Rohtak director, was quoted as saying by ET.

The students will have to shell out an additional Rs 80,000-2 lakh for their Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, depending on the institute. IIM Ahmedabad is set to be the costliest for students as the fees could go upto Rs 22 lakh for a postgraduate degree. IIM Bangalore sees an increase in fees to 21 lakh from 19.5 lakh while IIM Indore fees is set at Rs 16 lakh, ET reported.

Even the newer IIMs have joined the fee-hike bandwagon, as IIM Trichy fees go up to 14 lakhs from 12 lakhs. The institute director of Trichy, B Metri, claimed that the hike in fees is bound to happen due to the consistent quality of education that IIM provides to its students.

""IIMs have consistently been focusing on providing better quality education, many have international accreditations. Factoring in that, plus increasing costs, fees are bound to go up,"" Metri told ET.

According to management experts, the demand for good talents is high and the salary packages have also improved. While speaking on the hike, Narayanan Ramaswamy, partner and head, education and skill development, KPMG India told ET that it was the ""market that is determining the prices."""

With the new academic year set to begin, Local Circles, a Delhi-based organisation conducted an annual fee survey with 33,000 parents from across the country. Of these 4,000 parents were from Maharashtra.

In Maharashtra, parents were asked about the increase in school fee for their children when compared to last year. While 29 per cent parents said that the fee hike had gone up by 10 to 20 per cent, while 18 per cent parents said that the increase was over 20 per cent.

Around 87 per cent parents from across the country said that the respective state governments had not been successful in regulating fees. While 61 per cent parents attributed the hike to lack of regulation, 14 per cent said that it was because district officers did not enforce and implement laws with respect to fees effectively. Also, 25 per cent parents said that most schools disregard the regulations with respect to fee and often ignore advisories issued from the various enforcement agencies.

""Schools are increasing fees without realising that salary growth has been tepid this year. In such a scenario it is important that school fees which is the second largest expenditure item in most household budget should be curtailed. It is important for the state education department to look into this issue,"" said K Yatish Rajawat, chief strategy officer, LocalCircles.

Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association said, ""Over the last few months, the Maharashtra government has not taken any action against erring schools."""

The committee has reduced fees by up to 36% of the figures proposed by the schools. Only in the case of DAV International, Ahmedabad, has the fee been raised by Rs 542 over what the school had proposed, for the HSC science stream.

The fees declared by the committee for 170-odd schools ranged from Rs 14,000 to Rs 82,500 per annum. However, several prominent schools such as Prakash Higher Secondary, Udgam School for Children, Delhi Public School, and St Kabir have not yet presented fee proposals to the committee.

Sources in the committee said that the fee structure has to be approved by the Supreme court. The next hearing in the Supreme Court is scheduled for April 18. Under the Gujarat Self-financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act, 2017, the government had capped annual fees at Rs 15,000 for primary schools, Rs 25,000 for secondary schools, and Rs 27,000 for higher secondary schools barring the science stream. For the science stream, the cap was set at Rs 30,000 per annum.

The government had stated that schools which wanted to charge fees that breached the limit set by the Act had to file an application seeking permission to increase fees. Other schools had to file an affidavit affirming that they were adhering to the caps.

The committee has accepted the proposals of 24 schools and has not changed the fees proposed. Officials said that in the case of the HSC science stream in DAV School, the proposed fee was Rs 44,458; but the committee cleared Rs 45,000.

The officials said that the committee has been consistent in reducing fees across sections. For example, in the case of Red Bricks, Satellite, the proposed fees ranged from Rs 85,600 to Rs 1.18 lakh; the committee fixed the range at Rs 64,200 to Rs 82,500. That's a 25-30% reduction.

Interestingly, many schools had proposed more fees for the secondary sections than for the higher secondary sections. For example, Global Mission International School, Godhavi, proposed Rs 51,820 for the secondary section and Rs 30,000 and Rs 36,000 for the higher secondary general stream and the science stream respectively."

The Telangana government had ordered status quo on the fee hike on January 4, 2018, for the coming academic year. It was aimed at regulating tuition fees. The circular also instructed city private schools to not to collect any fee in excess of the notified amount. However, a petition was filed by Independent Schools Management Association, Hyderabad, challenging the Government memo banning fee hike.

Following Hyderabad High Court order allowing private schools in Hyderabad and across Telangana to raise school fees, school education department filed a petition on March 20, to get a stay on the order vacated. Though parents welcomed the move by the State Government, members of Hyderabad School Parents Associations (HSPA) questioned the delay.

They feared that as the case was listed for April 23 after which the courts would be on vacation. By the time the vacation ended, all schools would have already collected the increased fees. According to HSPA, if the government was really serious about the case, it would have mentioned it with the CJI and sought priority hearing. Parents said many schools had already finished the admissions for the coming academic year and fee payments had been done.

Joint secretary of HSPA K. Venkat Sainath told Deccan Chronicle, ""It is good to note that the government has filed a vacate stay petition. However, we are still forced to conclude that this is nothing but an eyewash."" Association member Hridesh Gupta said, ""The Government finally woke up. I just learnt that Uttar Pradesh passed an ordinance to stop school fee hike with immediate effect. I request Telangana to fight the case strongly in the court and bring an ordinance in Assembly."" The Commissioner of School Education was not available for comment.

School 'bows' to parent pressure

An international school, which had been demanding a first-term fee of Rs 84,000 after the parents had allegedly not applied for transfer certificate three months in advance, finally gave in. The student was given the TC (transfer certificate) without have to pay the additional amount. Hyderabad School Parents Association guided and counselled the parents. Association member Pavan Reddy said it was a small victory against 'school fee loot' in the state by private schools."
