As usual, the government has invoked national interest as justification for the order. Through Aadhaar, the government has in its possession identity data of almost the entire population. Now, the government is out to monitor our thoughts also. Nothing escapes the watchful eye of the state in India. - P Vijayachandran

It is not disputed that security of the country is of prime concern. But the government's new order does not lay down the conditions under which such surveillance of private information can be accessed and safeguards to avoid the order's misuse. Though the old order was introduced in 2009, the feeling of being threatened did not exist. As a parallel example, when Aadhaar was introduced, it had a narrower scope. But this government extended it to so many services that that the Supreme Court had to take up the matter and guarantee fundamental rights under the Constitution. - SN Iyer

Naseeruddin Shah's comment over growing intolerance is genuine (""The Daily Fix: The vicious reaction to Naseeruddin Shah underscores shrinking space for minorities""). There's consensus among the well-wishers of this country that this growing intolerance will harm national integrity and trust in the rule of law in this great nation. However the treatment Shah has received from the ruling BJP suggests that the party and its affiliates are only interested in the electoral politics and not in the diversity and integrity of the nation. - Rehan Ansar

This article only selectively represents the facts (""Sabarimala: Kerala has no will to ensure women's entry into shrine, say thwarted female pilgrims""). There is a mention of the Women's Wall Event. What has not been mentioned are the observations from Kerala High Court on how this should be conducted. There is no mention of the Ayyappa Jyothi Event that is being planned by those who oppose the Women's Wall Movement. There is an interview with the leader of the organisation who tried to enter the Sabarimala Shrine, but no comments from anyone who opposes the organisation's efforts. They have all put under a blanket label of ""mob"".

When both the aspects of a debate are presented, it helps the reader have an informed view of what is happening around us. - Pradeep PC

While this article raises some valid points, there is one aspect that it totally ignores - the near-complete absence of Muslim faculty members at the IIMs (""IIMs have used autonomy for self-aggrandisement, says professor pushing for faculty diversity""). After reading this article, I went through the listed faculty directories of all IIMs (except Rohtak and Hamirpur, as the websites weren't working) and saw that only five core faculty memebers were Muslim. This dearth of Muslims can also be seen even the visiting faculty and teachers for elective courses are offered by the institutes. If we are talking about diversity, then why is there no discussion on religion? - Ahmed Ashhar

The interview with the IIM Bangalore professor is an eye opener. His views on being responsible corporate citizens are much needed. We do not want to go the American way, where chasing money at any cost, even family, is legitimate.

The IIMs look at themselves as the Indian equivalent of Western business schools. The difference, not acknowledged by them, is that the Indian taxpayer funds the IIMs. Hence, IIMs have a holistic responsibility towards Indian citizens and not just to enriching themselves.

Indian citizens, therefore, have concerns that need to be addressed within the business models taught at IIMs.

His concern about environmental pollution and social diversity are a reality of the Indian citizens and should be adopted wholeheartedly with a responsibility. This, along with other concerns, like environmental destruction due to industrial activity and others, will make Indian IIMs global leaders in progressive and responsible business models. By not addressing these realities, IIMs are wasting an opportunity to lead the world in a new kind of business model. - Rajratna Jadhav

I could not agree more with Deepak Malghan. The IIMs have failed the nation by deliberately trying to create islands of engineer-dominated institutions without making any contribution to faculty development in small private institutions or state universities. There are consulting assignments because company boards want brand name credibility to endorse decisions. - Sudhakar GP

I read Nayanjot Lahiri's article with a lot of interest for two reasons (""The forgotten story of how Chipko Andolan pioneer Chandi Prasad Bhatt saved Badrinath temple""). The first is that I recently visited the Badrinath shrine and the second is that I met him sometime in 1975, when his movement was being pushed in Delhi by Anil Agarwal through the Centre for Science and Environment. I am glad for such articles which ensure that his efforts are not credited to others. - R Saha

I am worried by news of India's $1.4 billion aid package for the Maldives (""India declares $1.4 billion aid to Maldives""). I cannot understand the rationale behind giving so much money to another nation when our own country is struggling with financial insecurity.

When so many vital things are pending in our country for want of funds, how can people at the helm of governance act like this, that too to a country that has acted in a bitter way towards our nation, by sending back Indian workers and refusing to issue visas to them?

Who is accountable for this act of giving away such a huge sum when farmers are dying of indebtedness and victims of natural calamities are only given peanuts? - R Kanagasabai"

Several community leaders favoured the MR vaccination at a meeting called by the All India Ulema Board, an organization of religious leaders, at Islam Gymkhana on Thursday where health minister Deepak Sawant was chief guest.

A rumour that the MR vaccine might cause impotency has scared a section of the community and most city madrassas have still not got their students vaccinated. ""WHO officials, doctors from the health department and experts from Aligarh Muslim University have maintained that the MR vaccine is safe and necessary. We are requesting madrassa managements, teachers and imams to not oppose the vaccine which will help root out measles and rubella, just like polio was eradicated,"" said Allama Bunai Hasani, general secretary, Ulema Board.

NGOs suggested that BMC officials who hold camps in schools for MR vaccination should invite madrassas to bring their students there. ""The rumour will die if parents and teachers at madrassas see that the same vaccination is given to other schoolchildren,"" said Arshad Siddiqui, chairman, Red Crescent Society of India.

Convenor of Islamic Counter-Terrorism Council A R Anjaria said he will soon launch a campaign to convince madrassas across the country to get their students vaccinated. But city-based Markazul Maarif Research Centre director Maulana Burhanuddin Qasmi said he would neither speak in favour of the vaccine nor oppose it as he is not convinced about its efficacy."

Earlier, K A Sengottaiyan, school education minister, said the department was considering reduction of lessons for Class XI and XII students following representations over the 'voluminous textbooks'.

His statement came soon after the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT) announced that syllabus will be halved for CBSE students next year. A senior school education department official said the committee formed to write the new textbooks would proceed with the original plan to not reduce content.

""We might contemplate over this later, after NCERT's announcement is implemented,"" the official added.

Welcoming this, experts called the earlier proposal to reduce content as a retrograde step.

M Anandakrishnan, former IIT Kanpur chairman, said the new syllabus was framed in a a manner to help students in higher education and competitive exams. ""Reducing it will leave them handicapped,"" he said.

Government school teachers, who oppose the 'voluminous syllabus', said the higher secondary students, who were trained under a simple syllabus till Class X, were struggling to cope up with the vast content.

Responding to this, a curriculum revision committee member said, ""The new textbooks is voluminous by pages and not content. A study to compare the old and new textbooks revealed that there was an increase by only 5-7%, excluding value additions and worked out examples. Better design, layout and trimming repetitions in reference sections will reduce the number of pages also.""

The official added that though CBSE lessons might be reduced, NEET content will remain the same. ""Reducing our textbook content in a rush will only put our students at a comparative disadvantage,"" he added. Responding to this, S Prabhudoss from TN Post Graduate Teachers Association said, ""Present training modsule is effective. But without a blueprint, we are unable to guide the students.""

Educationist Prince Gajendra Babu said, ""Tamil Nadu should not follow NCERT's footsteps as it is not a benchmark. It is fine to revisit and make corrections so that contents are age-appropriate."""

Behind their sensation is the legacy of Prophet Muhammad's (saw) excellence, sublimity, inspired knowledge and action.

Generally, historians did consensus that Muslims encountered with some political upheavals in certain periods of human history temporarily but the spirituality remains always dominant.

All these spiritually sound personalities called Auliya Allah were, indeed, the embodiment of piety, divine light, inspired knowledge, and gnosis.

Glancing over history of spirituality what is now a days called Sufism or sometimes mysticism, we come across with the most celebrated Sufis; shining cosmic personalities, emerged just after the departure of the Companions of Prophet Muhammad (SAW).

Among them, the holy being of Shaikh Abdul QadirJilani popularly known by the famous epithet of Shah-i-Jilan in Indian subcontinent is one who is regarded as the chief of all Sufi brotherhoods having no match, no like in the annals of Islamic mysticism.

Abu Muhammad Abdul QadirJilani, son of Abu Salih Musa Jangi Dost was born in Jilan in 470-71 A.H/1077-78 C.E. He was a Sunni Hanabite theologian, erudite scholar, prolific writer, a Sufi and an influential preacher of Islam.

Regarding his education, he studied diverse disciplines of knowledge including, Quran, Hadith, Law and Tasawuf from a galaxy of reputed scholars' of his time.

Some of his teachers are Abu Bakr Ahmad ibn al-Muzaffaribnsausan al-Tammar, Abu Ghalib al-Baqillani, Abu'lQasimibn Bayan al-Razzaz, Abu Muhammad Ja'far al-Sarraj, Abu Said ibn Hashish, Abu Talibibn Yusuf etc.

Such high calibre scholars and Sufi mentors of Abdul Qadir succeeded to nurture the very personality of Abdul Qadir.

In fact, besides great bless of Allah, it was their efforts that made Abdul Qadir the imam of his time, the Qutb of his age and the teacher of teachers of his time. All those who have seen or read Abdul Qadir have paid a glowing tribute to his moral excellence, large heartedness, hospitality, modesty and generosity.

One of the contemporary scholars of Jilani, Hafiz Abu Abdullah Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Barzali reports as: ""His prayers were readily granted. Being extremely tender hearted, he would burst into tears (if anything sorrowful or touching was mentioned to him).""

More often he was to be found immersed in meditation and recollection of Allah. He was soft hearted, courteous, cheerful, generous and compassionate. Being the offspring of a noble family, he was also highly reputed for his profound knowledge and piety (Qala'id-ul-Jawahir).

Such a profound knowledge of the religious love and meticulous observance of the traditions of the holy Prophet (SAW), aided by the grace of Allah, has unveiled the mysteries of celestial world to Abdul Qadir.

He had acquired the certitude of knowledge that the shariah of the last Prophet (SAW) was perfect and that any claim made contrary to the divine edict was simply a satanic suggestion. It was the result of the spiritual state that he achieved by practicing the knowledge of Islam and the piety which he was an embodiment, that created magnetic attraction and heart touching effect to his sermons.

He used to deliver sermons mostly in the grand Mosque of Baghdad which impacted and transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Shaikh Amr al-Kashani reports that there was hardly a sermon delivered by Abdul Qadir after which a number of Jews and Christians did not embrace Islam, marauders and robbers did not repent for their sins, and heretics and apostates did not renounce their mistaken beliefs (Qala'id-ul-Jawahir).

His sermons that consists works like Futuh-ul-Ghaib, Al-Fath-ul-Rabbani and Jila'ilaKhatir still holds a high place to transform the lives of people and infuse in them the love of Allah.

Abdul QadirJilani infused that knowledge and piety to his novices. He always preached and propagated the message of Islam; knowledge and piety. With his profound knowledge and piety, he always yearn and advice his novices to receive knowledge that will benefit you in here and hereafter and will lead you to the highest degree of gnosis.

For that, he while analysing the sight of a Sufi said, ""the (true) believer has three eyes, the eye of the head with which he looks at this world, the eye of the heart with which looks at the hereafter, and the eye of the innermost being which remains with the truce (Allah) in this world and in the Hereafter because it is focused on Him in this world and in the hereafter"" (Jila'aliKhatir).

Similarly, he regards taqwa as the only noble pedigree. His asks his novices to approach him on the basis of taqwa and not that of mere pedigree.

He holds: ""O you who have such a noble pedigree is the fear of Allah...do not come to me on the feet of your pedigree but rather come to me on the feet of your fear of Allah. Be sensible that which Allah has, would not fall into your hand only virtue of your ancestral pedigree, but rather until you deserve the pedigree by the fear of Allah,"" (Jila'aliKhatir).

The sacred month of Rabi-ul-Sani reminds both to those who consider themselves the lovers of Jilani and for those who always oppose him. For the lovers, in his personality, there is a message of piety that his personality depicts in utmost perfection.

For the opponents, the high level of Islamic knowledge and deep understanding of Jilani constraints those to acknowledge his personality as had been acknowledged by the predecessor opponents' viz. Imam IbnTaymiyyah and IbnQaym al-Jawzi.

The traditional Kashmiri pheran (the loose gown worn during winters) is at the heart of a controversy in Kashmir valley after the education department in Langate banned the dress in its offices.

Leading the campaign against the pheran ban is National Conference vice-president and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah, who has started a campaign on Twitter to revoke the ban. Drawing flak, the education department withdrew the order in a bid to calm tempers.

The controversy started when the zonal education officer of Langate issued a circular banning pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes in his office.

""All officials visiting the office are advised to visit in proper dress code during any official visit. It is recommended that no official will visit this office wearing pheran, traditional trousers and sleeper/plastic shoes,"" read the circular.

The issue snowballed into a major controversy with people taking to social media calling it an assault on the Kashmiri culture. ""My father and I have worn pherans to official functions many times over the years and will continue to do so, silly government orders notwithstanding,"" Omar tweeted, with hashtags #dontbanourpheran and #revokepheranban.

People posted pictures wearing the pheran on Twitter to register their protest and oppose the ban. Omar too posted his and his father's pictures, wearing the pheran during functions.

""I fail to understand why pherans should be banned! This is a regressive order that makes no sense at all. Pherans are a very practical way of keeping warm during the cold winter, aside from being part of our identity. This order should be withdrawn,"" Omar said.

Under fire, the education department on Tuesday withdrew the order in a bid to put an end to the raging controversy. ""Teachers were coming to the office wearing sleepers and trousers. He the (zonal education officer) had reprimanded them not to do so. Then he issued an order in which he also included the pheran. Since pheran is our cultural dress, we have withdrawn the order,"" Mohommad Shafi War, chief education officer, Kupwara, told DNA.

Officials said the directions were issued with an aim to maintain office decorum and discipline. ""Since the pheran ban became an issue, we withdrew the order completely,"" said War.

Pheran is a traditional dress of Kashmir and both men and women take pride in donning it. Older Kashmiri women wear it throughout the year while men prefer to wear it during winters to keep warm.

People also use a 'kangri' (traditional fire pot) under the pheran to keep themselves warm. In 2014, the Army had to withdraw its advisory urging journalists not to wear pheran while visiting its Corps Headquarters."
