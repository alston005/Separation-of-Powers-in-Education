On the first day of the programme, the school staff will sit in a meeting with the parents and guardians of the students along with Anganwari and Asha workers, senior citizens, other community members of the locality, to ensure 100 percent transition of students and encourage new enrolment.

The students will also participate in an oath-taking ceremony, plantation drive, felicitation programme, cleanliness drive and lighting of earthen lamps in the school premises.

On the second day, the students will take out an educational rally to nearby areas of their schools with a banner displaying photographs of students performing various activities.

On the third day, the child mapping and parents mapping will be done by the school staffs by visiting the houses of the students to ensure 100 percent enrolment.

On the fourth day, children's community sports will be organised, while on the last day a cultural programme and children's drama will be organised. Community meeting on different issues of the schools by inviting distinguished persons of the locality will also be organised to encourage students and guardians for 100 percent enrolment.

While launching the programme, the DC said this initiative was taken with the advice of the Piramal Foundation and they had allotted Rs 500 to each of the 2,014 schools in the district. The activities will be participated in by the students from Class-I to Class-IX.

""The 6 percent dropout every year is very alarming and this programme will definitely build a strong bondage of the students with their schools so that they never leave the schools midway,"" added Gyani.

The Project Officer of Sarva Siksha Abhiyan of Dhubri, Abhijit Chakravarty said, ""obviously, poverty is a primary reason for this high dropout rate, but it has been observed that many miss school due to lack of encouragement."" He also added, ""the dropout rate of girl students was more than the boy students, but the community meetings ought to help in addressing the problem."""

Today, Diwakar has represented India in professional gaming tournaments (commonly called esports) and has even begun giving lectures in universities on how to take up esports as a viable career. According to Diwakar, while esports in India is not on a par with Asian standards yet, the gap is closing.

Part of the reason why gaming is picking up in the country is the rise of mobile gamers. While these gamers aren't professionals like Diwakar, they help the overall community.

Games like PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battleground) Mobile have driven this. ""If you look at the demographics of people playing on mobiles, they are 15-18 year olds. It's helping the cause because these gamers will grow older and might go into competitive gaming,"" says Vamsi Krishna, consumer marketing head, South Asia, Nvidia.

""Mobile and 4G connectivity have certainly democratized gaming but do not provide an immersive experience. We believe that while consumers will start off on mobile, more of them will eventually step up to gaming PCs,"" says Amit Doshi, chief marketing officer, India and South Asia, Lenovo.

To be sure, investments in the industry have also increased. Former owner of UTV, Ronnie Screwvala, has invested crores into the industry, even starting his own esports league.

GamingMonk, an Indian esports company, raised ₹4 crore from Japan's Incubate Fund, Rajan Anandan and other investors. A campus tournament for PUBG was recently held in the country, which had a prize pool of ₹50 lakh. It's also easier to arrange gaming events now, Diwakar points out, since companies like Samsung, Nvidia, Sony and more are happy to supply the equipment required, often at no cost.

But for any sport to really bring in the money, it requires viewers who can be monetised via advertisements and subscriptions. India has seen a growth in this area too. According to Abhay Sharma, founder of GamingMonk, the company gets more views on its videos (on YouTube and Twitch) now, to the tune of 150,000. He says he also finds 80,000-90,000 unique views on his videos. Two years ago, Sharma's audience was lower and more distributed.

But gamers have existed in India for years. Schools and colleges have organised gaming tournaments since the early 2000s, then why is the industry ready only now?

Most stakeholders agree that the smartphone and 4G revolution in the country is the primary reason. ""When Jio came in and cut data tariffs, more people started consuming online media, and eventually stumbled onto gaming,"" says Sharma. Growing Internet connectivity as a reason has also been suggested by Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus. Answering Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma's question about when esports becomes ""a thing"" in India, Pei tweeted on 5 November, ""With the way Internet connectivity is improving in the country, it won't be much longer.""

Other than cheap internet and smartphones, actual gaming equipment (graphics cards, monitors, etc.) are also easier to obtain. According to Diwakar, gamers can easily get in touch with companies and show their gaming stats to get sponsorships. Companies like Dell, Nvidia and Asus support full-fledged esports teams like Team Brutality (supported by Dell).

The next step in esports will come once players become more serious and start hitting global standards. Doshi mentioned the company has brought its top esports tournament, Legion of Champions, to India this year. Similarly, Nodwin Gaming, one of the top esports firms in India, now holds the license for the Indian edition of the Electronic Sports League, the world's largest esports firm.

Diwakar believes that Indian gamers will start achieving global standards in a couple of years, implying that 2019 will perhaps be the year when gaming goes mainstream."

That is why they have made it mandatory for students to respond with 'Jai Hind' or 'Jai Bharat' instead of the current 'yes sir' and 'present sir'.

A Government Resolution to this regard was issued in a circular by the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board, and Director, Primary Education and the new roll call comes into effect from January 1st.

The feat comes as another feather in the cap of Bengaluru government schools, where science and maths are no longer dreaded by students, thanks to initiatives like setting up of STEM (science technology engineering mathematics) laboratories in the institutions by NGOs and volunteers.

""I have designed a smokeless train using solar panels. I am experimenting with wind energy to make it faster and more efficient,"" said Ravi Kumar D, a class 7 student from the Hebbal school. The other winners are Mithun from class 6, who came up with a waste management model, and Anil and Vasant Kumar from class 8, whose project was based on wind energy.

""Our students were on a par with their private school counterparts, who have access to good science labs,"" said Umme Salma, science teacher at the government school.

The school has had a science lab for long but it was not used due to shortage of time and logistics. Mobile science labs began visiting the school and teachers started holding classes at a science centre set up on the campus by an NGO. The enhanced quality of education reflected in the numbers -- admissions went up from 425 in 2017 to 535 in 2018.

""When we started mobile science labs for students in government schools, the excitement to learn was palpable. Some of the kids are quick learners. That's what made us set up this centre. Students from 10 nearby government schools can visit the centre, innovate and experiment,"" said Dilip Gowda, head of the science centre set up in the school by Agastya International Foundation.

The foundation runs about eight science centres in government schools in Immadihalli, Electronics City, Yelahanka, Sarjapur Road and Kengeri, among other places.

In 2016, he represented a robotics team at Robocup International in Leipzig, Germany, and he visited Japan the next year to take part in the event's 2017 edition. He was accompanied by his schoolmates Aravind Reddy, Ramakrishna and Lawrence Aga, who have a similar background like his. ""It was a dream come true. It was our teacher's motivation which took us to these places,"" said Ramesh.

The quartet was from Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, Viveknagar, and was drawn to robotics during their STEM education classes.

Sridhar P, an IISc graduate, who left his cushy job to train government school students in robotics, has taken students from six government institutions to international competitions. ""STEM labs help in students' overall development, instilling qualities like peer learning, leadership and creativity in them. They give students the confidence that they can make something work. They also connect science and maths to real-world problems. Unconsciously, the students become computer literate too,"" said Sridhar.

""Thanks to the robotics project we started on a pilot basis in Seva Bharath Trust Government Telugu Higher Primary School, students wanted to spend more time in class. They created LEGO robots, a humanoid and what not. Students are bright enough to grasp concepts; it's all about giving them access,"" said Sushmita Ananth from Akshara Foundation.

Vandana P, a teacher from RT Nagar Government School, said that lack of access to labs and rote learning of science with focus on theory make students fear the subject.

This year the school education sector in Punjab certainly saw some ups even as the last quarter of 2018 was marked by two-month-long protests by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and RMSA teachers from October.

As the contractual teachers protested against the state government's decision to regularise 8,886 teachers, but with pay cut, as many as 2,265 government schools saw a facelift with world-class infrastructure. Also the students of several government schools set unprecedented examples of their IQ level. And last, but not the least, English, the subject, in which maximum number of students fail in the final exams of Punjab School Education Board, is no more dreaded in many government schools now.

The schools were given a facelift under 'Smart School Project' launched by the government. Crores have been spent on attractive clean buildings, smart classrooms, computer rooms, hygienic toilets, playgrounds, drinking water facilities and colourful premises. Government, however, has not spent from its pocket, but motivated individual donors, Non-government Organisations (NGOs), charitable trusts, firms, and Non-resident Indians to financially help the schools.

Even Director General School Education-cum-Project Director Parshant Goyal had written to several NGOs, charitable trusts and firms to contribute towards digital classrooms, laboratories and toilets, provide books in libraries, uniforms to the students, create infrastructure for Midday Meals and sports, install solar power plants and Reverse Osmosis system and any way that the donor or the school deemed fit.

Education Secretary Krishan Kumar confirmed the infrastructure in 2,265 schools have already been improved and by the end of this academic session, a total of 4,250 institutes will be covered. He said some 100 teachers of Punjab are supporting them hugely by motivating people.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, it will become a sustainable model of community ownership and accountability,"" said he, adding the government will provide support on pedagogy, ways of teaching, resolving specific problems etc. ""It will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner. We will cover all 20,000 government schools in a few years,"" said he.

Several government schools, including government middle schools at Rajgarh village (Ludhiana), Malwa and Nawanshahr, have already started getting applications from people in advance for reservation of seats for their wards for the next session, revealed the education secretary. ""Two government school teachers in Nawanshahr have got admitted their wards,"" said he.

""It is a dream come true for us as we belong to poor families and haven't even thought of having access to facilities like e-content, computer labs and libraries,"" said one Kamljit Kaur of Kishangarh village in Mansa district. Along with the infrastructure, the education standard has also started improving. The students of Government Primary School, Jhangerian, in Nurpur Bedi block of Ropar district, have set an example. Several students of this schools have memorised the names of all 117 Assembly segments, 13 Lok Sabha constituencies, names of several countries with their respective capitals, that of Punjabi and Indian English writers, Indian scientists, Indian festivals, national holidays and neighbouring countries.

Education secretary has also uploaded the videos of these children on social media. ""Under Parho Paunjab Project, we have designed several programmes and now our students are speaking in English without any hesitation and several schools have started conducting prayers in English now,"" said District Mentor of English, Chander Shekhar.

Even, a renowned missionary-run convent school, St Francis in Batala (Gurdaspur district) had invited the government school students during a Science and maths fair recently.

2. Bhima Koregaon: Before Memorial Day, Fear Under Security Blanket

Many who will welcome the new year under flimsy pandals around the Bhima Koregaon war memorial have spent every December 31 here, swatting mosquitoes and singing Ambedkarite songs to distract from the cold. But January 1, 2019, is different. It marks a year of deepening faultlines at the site of the 1818 war that saw a Colonial army, helped by a Mahar regiment, defeat the Peshwas. This new year, the day that marks the overthrow of upper-caste rule is time to mull over what remains a divided society.

""It's going to be peaceful tomorrow,"" says Santosh Davne, 35, from Nanded. A vendor of trinkets featuring Dr B R Ambedkar and the Buddha, the disabled Davne has been visiting the Jaystambh, the obelisk to honour soldiers who died on January 1, 1818, on the banks of the Bhima, for 12 years. ""I set up a stall every year, but I have never seen such police presence or such quiet fear among people,"" he says.

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Monday threatened to reconsider support to the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan if they failed to withdraw the cases lodged against people who participated in the 'Bharat Bandh' organised on April 2 over the alleged dilution of the SC/ST Act.

7. 30 Lakh Reapply for Inclusion in Assam NRC

About 30 lakh of the 40.07 lakh people left out of the final draft of the updated National Register of Citizens (NRC) published five months ago have applied again for inclusion during the claims and objections round that ended on Monday.

During the phase, 600 objections also came in from those who doubted the citizenship of others included in the draft.

The window for 40.07 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants excluded from the complete draft was opened on 25 September. It was to have closed on 15 December, but the Supreme Court, which is monitoring the exercise, extended the last day to 31 December after the Assam government said the panchayat election, held on 5 and 9 December, had robbed the people and officials of precious time.

8. Pumps to Remove Water from Meghalaya Mine on Tuesday

Personnel of multiple agencies engaged in the search and rescue operation for at least 13 miners trapped in a coal mine at Ksan in Meghalaya's East Jaintia Hills, found a wooden structure, coal and mud near the bottom of the pit on Monday.

Six divers of the Indian Navy and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) had on Sunday detected a few rat-holes - narrow tunnels where miners have to crawl into to extract coal.

R. Susngi, spokesperson for the district administration, said the site had been cleared for the Odisha Fire Service to start pumping out water from the main shaft measuring about 150 sq ft in area and about 350 ft deep. Other shafts were being prepared to keep at least three of the 10 high-power pumps brought from Odisha operating for longer durations, he said.

9. Pujara and Kohli Difference Between Two Sides, Says Australia Coach Langer

Australian coach Justin Langer has lamented a lack of world-class batsmen in his side's line-up and pointed out that Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara have been the difference for the visitors in the on-going four-match Test series.

India won the third Test at the MCG by 137 runs to take an unassailable 2-1 lead in the series. The fourth Test begins in Sydney on Thursday, 3 January.

""At this stage, the difference in the series is Pujara and Kohli, if we're frank. Pujara averages 53 and Kohli has averaged 46 and got a duck in the second innings. The lesson we learn from that is he just absorbed all our pressure,"" Langer said on Monday.

Excelsior Sports Correspondent

JAMMU, Dec 31: Former Minister and Congress leader Sh Sham Lal Sharma said that schools should focus on moral values rather than mere education to the students.

The former Minister was speaking in the Annual Day function of Chander Bhaga High School, Akhnoor as a chief guest.

The function started with the lamp lighting by chief guest Sham Lal Sharma (Former Minister), guest of honour Gopal Singh (S.D.M Akhnoor), special guests Nazneen Akhtar (Z.E.O Akhnoor), Kuldeep Kumar Badyal (Principal GHSS), Dr. Swaran Singh Chib (District Youth Services and Sport Officer, Reasi), Sher Singh (Ex. Z.P.E.O Akhnoor) and from the Management of School, Raman Gupta and Aradhana Mahajan.

Sharma in his speech strongly advocated for change in the present educational set up and suggested to introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level. He said parents and teachers have also greater role to play in this direction and they must instil the moral ethics and rich ethos of Indian culture in the students so that they become good citizens and contribute for the welfare of the society and nation. He said on the eve of New Year ""we all should take a pledge to save the Girl Child and raise our voice against the crimes against the females and to contribute for a healthy and prosperous society"".

He asked teachers that while nurturing the students to achieve new highs in science, technology and modern studies, equal attention is paid to outdoor activities like sports, travel, etc which enables physical and mental development of the child."

Speaking about the initiative, V Kamalesh, 24, who studied in the school from 1999 to 2003, said they had formed a volunteer forum called 'Young Heartz' through which they do philanthropic activities every New Year. ""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

Headmistress C Rajam said the school now has 121 students in five classes.

Over the course of 10 months, IGR has highlighted successful initiatives on issues including health, gender parity, climate change, education, and Kerala's post-flood rehabilitation. Here is a selection of five stories, each covering one of our focus areas, that made an impact in 2018 and hold out hope for India's future.

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77 percent of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on 14 September, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change.

The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender Parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as IndiaSpend reported on 26 June 2018. Only 14 percent of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77 percent have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence.

Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpendreported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Education

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Disaster Relief and Rehabilitation

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel.

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

As the country braces for the 2019 general elections, the impact of good governance, or the lack of it, will be under the spotlight. We aim to increase our coverage of governance issues, and welcome your suggestions and feedback.

Climate Change

Challenge: Climate change can lower the standard of living of nearly half of India's population by 2050, the World Bank warned in a June 2018 study. Particularly vulnerable are farmers who are dependent on rainfall for a good harvest, especially in regions such as Karnataka that are prone to drought. In the 15 years to 2015, only three years--2005, 2007 and 2010--witnessed no drought, as per a 2017 assessment report by the Karnataka State Disaster Management Monitoring Centre. In 2018, 77% of the 30 districts were declared drought-hit, The Times of India reported on September 14, 2018.

Action: A farmer couple, Shyamrao and Laximibai Patil, in water-scarce Kalaburagi in north Karnataka, have shown that a combination of state and NGO support, supported by grassroots innovation, can help farmers combat the effects of climate change. The Patils practice organic farming, run a dairy and poultry farm, and are helping their fellow farmers experiment with new methods.

The couple have set up their own self-help group to sell produce such as pulses. From their mixed-crop farming and livestock produce, they make an annual income of Rs 5 lakh and a profit of around Rs 2.5 lakh, at a time when 70% of the country's agricultural households

spend more than they earn on average every month.

Gender parity

Challenge: In 2017, nearly 50,000 women died at the hands of intimate partners or family members, making ""home, the most dangerous place for women"", according to a November 2018 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

India is perceived as having the worst record on sexual violence, harassment from cultural and traditional practices and human trafficking, and is considered the least safe country in the world for women, according to a Thomson Reuters Foundation poll, as

IndiaSpend reported on June 26, 2018. Only 14% of Indian women who have experienced physical or sexual violence have sought help to stop the violence while 77% have neither sought help nor told anyone about the violence they experienced, according to the National Family Health Survey (2015-16).

Action: In Mumbai, health advocacy Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes has since 2001 been running support centres called Dilaasa, which are funded by the National Health Mission, to identify victims of domestic and sexual violence. Using a model of care that can be replicated across government health centres nationwide, Dilaasa centres have provided help to more than 8,000 women.

Over the two years to 2018, Mumbai's 11 centres identified 5,647 women as potential victims of domestic violence. They got 2,554 cases registered for domestic violence and 809 cases for sexual violence, according to municipal records. Sikkim, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh are replicating and activating this model.

Health

Challenge: India has 46.6 million stunted children and is home to 31% of all stunted children under five--the highest in the world--according to the 2018 Global Nutrition Report, IndiaSpend reported on December 10, 2018.

Nearly 20% of Indian children under five are wasted (have low weight for their height) and 7% severely wasted, according to

data from the National Family Health Survey of 2015-16.

The Society for Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), an NGO in Mumbai's Dharavi, the third largest slum in Asia by population, is helping reduce the prevalence of child malnutrition by plugging nutrition awareness gaps and supporting local health workers.

Action: SNEHA's efforts have reduced wasting among children aged up to three by 23% and produced a 109% increase in the services received by children through the Integrated Child Development Services Scheme, a government programme covering health, food and primary education. It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

The move comes after farmers started locking up stray cows in government buildings to protect their crops from them. Aligarh's Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ajay Kumar Sahni said the decision has been taken on the suggestion of some police personnel.

""Some incidents have come to our notice in which the bovines which stopped giving milk are often left out in the open to fend for themselves in farms or at other places. Lately, we have to face some law and order issues because of these animals,"" Sahni told news agency ANI. The SSP said some police officers proposed to adopt stray bovines. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath Instructs Officials to 'Ensure Shelter for Stray Cows'.

""Hence we have decided that all police station chiefs, circle officers and senior police officials from the district will be adopting one such animal each. This will also give a message to the people as well not to abandon their animals if they stop giving milk,"" he said. Sahni added that if needed, then these animals can also be kept at the police stations.

The SSP said that the purpose of the initiative is to encourage citizens who can afford maintenance of stray bovines to adopt these animals in the larger interest of the society. He said policemen will continue to adopt stray bovines till all cow shelters in the state become operational. Earlier, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.

This initiative by the Aligarh Police comes days after over 700 stray cows were locked up inside a government school and primary health centre in Gorai area of the district by farmers on December 24 and 25 to save their crops from being damaged by the cattle. ""The cows are destroying our crops. For long, we have been demanding cow shelters from the government but no action is being taken,"" a farmer had said.

Last week, the district authorities had to deal with locals, mostly belonging to villages falling under Iglas and Khair tehsils, driving away the stray cattle to compounds of different government buildings, including schools and hospitals. Several schools in the area were reportedly closed as farmers turned the compounds into temporary cow shelters."

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

It plugs gaps in nutrition-related knowledge in the community by training community volunteers, who spread awareness and inform anganwadi (daycare) workers about the status of pregnant women and families who are finding it difficult to feed a newborn.

Challenge: India has been successful in increasing primary school enrolment to the extent that more than 83% of primary school-age children were enrolled in 2016-17, according to data from the District Information System for Education (DISE). But fewer than half (47.8%) of grade V rural students could read at least a grade II text in 2016, the Annual Survey of Education Report 2016 found.

Action: World Vision, a non-profit, runs a remedial education programme, Aparajitha, for 4,300 students in government schools in 130 villages in Lalitpur district in Uttar Pradesh. From a zero baseline, within a year 1.55% of enrolled students could read local content (such as newspapers) and understand it; 6.2% (up from 1.8%) could read a story and comprehend it; and 10.4% could read a story (up from 5.1%). World Vision expects to complete the project by 2020 and empower the community to take over.

Challenge: In the two decades to 2017, India suffered a $79.5 billion loss, ranking among the top five countries in the world to be affected by climate-related disasters, The Wire reported on October 11, 2018. India is taking baby steps towards disaster preparedness, the lack of which is becoming obvious in the wake of climate change-related extreme weather events. Only 7% of the 4,862 dams in the country have emergency action plans, a 2017 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India said, the Hindustan Times reported on September 3, 2018. Often, the armed forces are summoned to undertake rescue operations, such as during the recent Kerala floods in August 2018, despite the constitution of the National Disaster Response Force in 2006.

The Kerala floods affected an estimated 5 million people's lives and damaged infrastructure to the extent that the state needs nearly Rs 30,000 crore to rebuild.

Action: The Kerala state electricity board's quick response under Mission Reconnect restored electricity to nearly 2.5 million homes in less than two weeks. Kerala is one of the 15 states in India that have 100% household electrification, the Hindustan Times reported on November 28, 2018. It managed the task by improving coordination through a state-level task force and an army of volunteers comprising retired staff, students and private electricity personnel."

Nature is everything for them. The tribals, who migrated to this place from the erstwhile south Bihar and now Jharkhand decades ago, care and worship the forests, hills and ever-flowing narrow streams descending from the hills.

These tribals love, protect and preserve the forest as they believe they can only survive in the lap of woods. However, they do not lead a normal life as they have been deprived of basic infrastructure like road, electricity, water, educational institutes, primary health centres and transportation facilities. In the 21st century, they still live like jungle men and women -- ignorant of another world that claims itself to be civilised and modern.

What has held back the development activities is inaccessibility. One has to trek miles to reach these villages. All efforts to build roads and electricity infrastructure have fallen flat due to lack of coordination between forest and revenue departments. The forest department, as for Forest Conservation Act, 1980, considers residents of these villages illegal occupants. This has stood in the way of the villages getting the ""revenue village"" tag.

Non-recognition of the human habitations as revenue villages prevents the education department to build schools and the health department to establish hospitals. There are about 10,000 people living in 61 villages of Simlipal forests.

""We have no primary and high schools here. The only Anganwadi centre has no government teacher. It is managed by Centre for Youth and Social Development, a development organisation. Since we have no hospital here, people are left to fend for themselves. Last year, we lost two children and a pregnant woman died this year as we could not take them to the hospital which is 12 km from here. We carry the patients on slings and cots and walk down to hospitals,"" said Sadhu Makhud of Jharjhari village under Thakurmunda block.

Early-age marriage is seen to be continuing in these villages. This has resulted in both mother and children suffering from malnourishment and other health complications.

Birasingha Ugrasandhi, a resident of Bhaliadal village, said despite repeated requests to the Mayurbhanj district administration, there are no activities related to infrastructure development.

""Besides roads, schools and hospitals, we also fight to get drinking water. Our village does not have tubewells or dug wells. The narrow streams flowing down from the nearby hills shrink in the summer and get contaminated because of overdependence on them by human beings, domestic animals and wildlife. Villagers often get sick after drinking contaminated water,"" says Birasingha.

Lack of education has forced the people to continue with their primitive living style - herding goats and collecting firewood to cook their food, besides undertaking poultry activities.

Agriculture has been confined to growing paddy and vegetables, which is at the mercy of rain god.

""Since we have no government mandi or procurement centre here, we are forced to sell our paddy between '1,100 and '1,200 per quintal as against '1,750 minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Union government,"" says Jagabandhu Ho of Bhaliadal.

The villagers are yet to see a television set. For them, radio is the only source of information and entertainment.

Today, the villagers are living a little better life as Oxfam, an international development organisation, in association with Regional Center for Development Cooperation, a Bhubaneswar-based non-governmental organisation, is intervening in those villages. Erection of solar-lighting and solar-irrigation systems has brought about significant changes in their lives.

People are now able to charge their mobile phones with solar battery. They can now irrigate their land with solar water pumps.

With the help of development organisations, the area is coordinating with the district administration. As a result, some villagers have got Individual Forest Rights (IFR) and Community Forest Rights (CFR). This has enabled them to undertake cultivation. Grant of CFR has helped them procure forest produces without hassles, process them and sell them to various government and agencies, including state government's Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Such activities are slowly improving the local economy.

Dillip Subudhi, a leading researcher who spent over 17 years in villages situated in Similipal and forests in other parts of the state, feels there will be remarkable improvement in the life of forest dwellers once their habitations are recognised as revenue villages and they are given IFR and CFR over their claimed lands as per the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

""Though the Odisha government has a good track record in settling IFR and CFR claims, a lot of activities remain to be done. In villages, people have got IFR and CFR titles over their claimed lands. However, many of them still cannot make productive use of these lands as the lands granted to them are yet to be demarcated by revenue officials,"" says Mr Subudhi.

Speaking to this newspaper, state ST & SC development minister Ramesh Chandra Majhi said the government had asked the district administrations to complete the titles of the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019.

""We have asked the collectors of all tribal-dominated districts to settle the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019. Once this process is complete, you will see significant change in the life of forest dwellers,"" the minister said.

Of the 4.19 crore population of Odisha, nearly 23 per cent (22.85 per cent, according to 2011 census) is tribal.

In almost all the tribal-dominated districts, the conditions of those living in forests are almost identical, say social activists who have been working among the marginalised sections of society."

An education department official said: ""This decision was taken by the department. We had no say in it. Officially, the reason is low attendance.""

According to official records that TOI has sourced, at the time of being closed down, GPS Sehrawan had zero students and two teachers. Charan Singh, one of the teachers at the school, said: ""I don't know what the records say, but at the time the school was unofficially shut down in 2015, we had around 26 students."" Today, the four rooms in the school lay deserted. A poster in one room displays the midday meal schedule, that includes among others chaat on Monday and dal on Wednesday. One of the walls has a political map of Haryana, showing different districts.

A letter sent by the education department earlier this year reads: ""The government has decided that 62 government primary schools having zero student strength may be closed down or merged. Posts sanctioned and teachers working in schools which are to be merged may be shifted to schools with which it is proposed to be merged. However, at the time of rationalisation, posts of teachers will be rationalised on the basis of actual requirement at that point of time. All such teachers shall compulsorily participate in the next transfer drive.""

Officially, there are no students at GPS, Sehrawan, although the school has two teachers. Following the education department notification, the staff have been told they may be transferred to a school facing staff crunch. Tarun Suhag of Haryana Primary Teachers Association said, ""Primary schools should never be shut down. If at all, closures should happen based on data from three consecutive years, not from a single year."""

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The proposal to ""voluntarily"" adopt a bovine was mooted at the meeting of district police officials by Aligarh senior superintendent of police AK Sahni. Forty-one police personnel, who attended the meeting, offered to adopt one stray bovine each. These included four additional SPs, nine circle officers and 27 police station incharges, besides the SSP himself. The bovines will be adopted from January 1.

Talking to TOI, SSP AK Sahni said that the purpose of the initiative is to send a message among the residents that those who can easily afford maintenance of a stray animal should do it in order to help the society at large.

""Every adverse law and order situation is to be faced by us, so we should be the ones taking the initiative in resolving the problems that ail the society,"" Sahni said, adding that this arrangement will continue till all the cow shelters, which are being constructed by the government, become operational.

Meanwhile, Aligarh district magistrate CB Singh has also planned to call a meeting and urge all the administrative staff, around 15,000 of them, to voluntarily adopt a stray bovine each. He said, ""This is a good step in terms of contributing for a social cause.""

Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past week.

On Wednesday, students and teachers of around a dozen government primary and upper primary schools in Aligarh were forced to stay out of their classrooms on Wednesday as local residents in Iglas area herded stray cows and bulls inside the school compounds. Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre."

At least seven candidates -- six being BNP nominees -- announced to stay off the polls with most of them alleging that their agents were ousted from polling centres by the ruling party workers.

BNP's Ruhul Kabir Rizvi alleged that polling centres are being occupied across the country, the party's agents are being driven out and that its supporters and activists are facing violence.

""From the picture we have received, this is a violent election. We are seeing a one-sided election environment conducted at the whims of the government. This paints a clear picture that they want to ensure a favourable result through a one-sided contest,"" Mr. Rizvi told a media briefing at the party office.

Party's secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told the media from his northwestern Thakurgaon constituency that some of their candidates stayed off the vote in their ""personal decisions"" but ""we will announce our party stance at 4 p.m. when the voting will end"".

The Jatiya Oikya Front is a coalition of four parties -- Gono Forum, BNP, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal-JSD, Nagorik Oikya and Krishak Sramik Janata League -- led by Hossain.

Bangladesh police chief Mohammad Javed Patwary said the nationwide polls are ""progressing peacefully"" and vowed to investigate the ""isolated"" incidents of violence.

Over 600,000 security personnel including several thousand soldiers and paramilitary border guards were deployed across the country to help conduct the election in which 10.41 crore people were eligible to vote.

Security agencies have been asked to keep an extra vigil on religious minority communities as media reports said at least three Hindu households were set on fire by miscreants between December 16 and 26.

According to the eyewitnesses, posters bearing the ruling party's ""boat"" symbol outnumbered those of the main opposition's ""sheaf of paddy"".

BNP earlier said intimidation and police harassment kept their activists away from the campaign and polling process.

""Barring some unwanted incidents, the polling so far was smooth and peaceful...We could tell you at the end of the day if the election was participatory,"" Chief Election Commissioner Nurul Huda told reporters.

The 11th parliamentary poll is the first fully competitive general election in a decade since 2008 while it is widely expected to be won by the Awami League of Hasina, who is likely to be the country's first premier for the fourth terms.

Citing security reasons, authorities temporarily blocked mobile data services and slowed down the internet.

According to the Election Commission, 1,848 candidates are contesting for 299 out of 300 Parliament seats. The polls are being held at 40,183 polling stations. Voting was suspended in one seat due to the death of a candidate.

They are making a splash in Aligarh district of Uttar Pradesh. It all started a few days ago with Timotia village, where irate farmers fed up with stray cattle eating up their crops, rounded up 500 heads of cows and locked them up in the local primary school. It was not just to get the rampaging cattle off their land; it was to get the government administration to find a solution.

The protest has spread like wildfire. Aligarh farmers are rounding up stray cattle and locking them up in nearest government buildings -- hospitals, offices, schools. Work in these government outposts has come to a halt, and the local administration is paralysed. Cities and towns too are facing traffic accidents and people are being horned by stray bulls. India's 'stray' cattle population is believed to have hit 5.2 million, and Maharashtra alone is estimated to have 7.5 lakh heads roaming untended on the roads.

A frustrated sub-divisional magistrate from Aligarh, A K Sharma, summed up the crisis thus: ""Once a cow stops giving milk, they leave it on the streets. We have to rescue cattle and transport them to overflowing gaushalas.""

Dairy farming disrupted

The crisis we see in Aligarh and elsewhere is a fallout of the disruption of the dairy economy by last year's ban on trade and sale of cattle. The situation has been aggravated by cow vigilantism, where gangs of extortionists have attacked dairy farmers. The crisis was triggered with the notification of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Market) Rules on May 23 last year, which banned sale of cattle for slaughter in animal markets. It was withdrawn in October 2017 and a fresh watered down draft issued in April this year.

Arvind Subramanian, then Chief Economic Advisor when the 2017 ban was first imposed, broke ranks with the government and said that if the farmer was not able to sell his less productive cattle for meat, it would lead to dairy farming becoming uneconomical. He also warned: ""Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs."" Subramanian's warning is now playing out.

Ban policies and cow vigilantism have knocked the bottom off the normal cycle of the dairy economy. The milch cow has a normal productive period of eight to nine years, after which the farmer sells his aged stock and uses the money to renew his herd. The old stock earlier went to abattoirs as meat or as hides for the leather industry. It's like selling your old car, investing a little more, and buying a new one. Abattoirs are now closed and for the dairy farmer, this 'resale' option is not there. Expectedly, prices of cattle of all varieties have plummeted.

Thus, the farmer has no investible surplus to renew his livestock; and to add insult to injury, he is now saddled with unproductive cows he is forced to feed. The only option he has is to dump his old herd on the roads or in someone else's field.

Rollback necessary

After Bulandshar, where cow vigilantes lynched a police officer, it is Aligarh. And these are warning signals the Centre can scarcely afford to ignore. India is too diverse a country to be foisted with a unitary diktat on food habits and cultural norms. Beef is consumed by over 80 million Indians as a staple diet and 12.5 million of these are Hindus. In the seven north-east states as well as Kerala and Goa, beef is sold openly and there is no ban on cow slaughter.

But more than pleas for diversity, it is economics that must prevail. Despite all the brouhaha, India is the world's second largest beef exporter in 2018, accounting for 1.9 million tonnes. Over two decades, it has increased its milk production tenfold to 185 MT a year; and by 2020, it is all set to overtake the European Union as the largest dairying nation. To disrupt all this by restricting bovine trade is to hit jobs and farm incomes.

It is time that some of these trading and cattle restrictions were rolled back. Supporting ill and ageing livestock can be crueler. Thousands of cows have died in ill-equipped and overcrowded gaushalas. People's sentiments have to be respected and there should be no open display of slaughter and sale in Hindu localities, but at the same time shackling Indian agriculture to religious bigotry is not an option."

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is all set to hold an initial cabinet meeting on Saturday (December 29), where he will announce key decisions on governance roadmap and review some decisions taken by the previous government.

The meeting will be a curtain raiser for the new Congress government in the state as Gehlot looks to set up a 100-plan to monitor implementation of fresh decisions. ""We have to start implementing our promises quickly,'' Gehlot had said earlier.

The 67-year-old chief minister indicated that his government will entirely focus on developmental projects. Gehlot wants to focus on reviving the stalled Barmer Refinery project but many are still expecting a word from him on the construction of Jaipur Metro phase-II.

His deputy, Sachin Pilot has also offered a clear vision for governance in the state after a period of divergence with Gehlot over the distribution of portfolios. Congress President Rahul Gandhi had to interfere for the second time to settle issues between Gehlot and Pilot.

Pilot has bagged crucial departments including PWD, Rural Development and Panchayati Raj. Meanwhile, Gehlot has kept nine ministries including finance, personnel, excise and home with him.

While most ministers are satisfied with their departments, a few have expressed their reservation of not getting their due in off the record conversation with India Today TV. Despite differences, Gehlot has been able to convince everyone that work must be started immediately to deal with existing issues in the state.

The 41-year-old deputy chief minister said he will not give anyone a chance to raise a finger on promises made. ""We will get going immediately,'' he said.

Issues such as debt farm debt waiver, employment generation and agenda of good governance will be taken up at the meeting tomorrow.

Union Minister for Urban Development and Housing Shanti Dhariwal said he would look into land allotment to BJP offices; he also expressed concern over poor finances of the Jaipur Development Authority.

The new cabinet will also be reviewing few other decisions of the Raje government such as a merger of primary schools, but all eyes are on whether Gehlot will set up a commission to investigate decisions of the last government.

The aim of The Hope Circuit is to ""give corporate bands the limelight they deserve,"" says musician Howard Pereira, the man behind the initiative, where a corporate band opens for a well-established band at Hard Rock Cafe every month. The bands that play are from all corporate sectors, banking being the most popular one. Most have learnt music growing up and gave it up for many reasons, monetary being the primary.

For the last few years, 30-year-old Vashi resident Arvin David, who runs the music company Connect, has been introducing students with hearing loss to the beats of the djembe -- a rope-tuned goblet drum with origins in West Africa. To accomplish this, he invented the ""vibration box"" -- a two-seater box, made with wood of a particular thickness and width, inside which speakers are placed. David's djembe is connected to the speakers via a wireless microphone. He is not alone. Breach Candy resident Nicole Fernandes recently started an electronic keyboard tutorial on YouTube, Music For The Deaf.

Kirsten Varela has turned his backyard into a no-frills calisthenics park and christened it Elysium, a place of perfect happiness. ""The best part about calisthenics is that it's mainly 90 per cent upper body,"" he says. ""Calisthenics is mixing your body with movements like mobility, stability and just trying to create a beautiful movement.""

This year saw the launch of apps like Delta, which are LGBTQ friendly, and Tinder also opened up its platform to be more inclusive.

Sensing the growing homophobia in schools, former student Kabir Karamchandani formed a support group titled Garv in February to address the issue. While the 20-year-old may be miles away, pursuing his higher education in Oberlin, Ohio, his legacy is being carried forward by a dedicated team of 'woke' boys and girls. Interestingly, the Garv initiative might be included as a case study in a large scale survey conducted by Humsafar Trust on bullying in schools.

In October, the Diss track trend hit India when Mumbai underground rapper Emiway took on popular singer Raftaar. When rapper Raftaar said in an interview that there was no money to be made in underground rapping and named Emiway, the 22-year-old Mumbai rapper released a diss track called Samajh Mein Aaya Kya trying to address the issue. Then Raftaar released a song, then Emiway released another... well, you get the drift. What makes it good for you is that you can follow them and enjoy some quality music.

One man's problem could well be another man's opportunity. And entrepreneurs Ameya Davda and Devak Davda's startup, Space Valet, know that well.

You browse the website and find a suitable storage plan, then order as many boxes as you need, and then pack and label your belongings.

What is it about Ludo King that has made it beat Temple Run, Candy Crush and Pokemon Go, to become the No. 1 free game on both Google Play Store and App Store? We dug deep to find out how this trend has seamlessly penetrated the lower rungs of the socio-economic segment, galvanising a strata that hadn't warmed up to digital games. Raamesh Gowri Raghavan, an ancient Indian games researcher and professor of archaeology at Mumbai University, believes the game has an innately competitive element which makes it addictive.

Their handcrafted cane chairs and tables, and upholstery can be seen at the BMC office, Bombay High Court, sessions court, sales tax, excise and police departments. If recruitment is through word of mouth, so are contracts, which means you can order from them, too.

Makarand Deshpande, the maverick playwright, finished his 50th original script, Epic Gadbad, marking a milestone in a glorious journey onstage. A farce, it is a conclusion to his previous play, Shakespearecha Mhatara, which was a hilarious take on King Lear. While it was first staged at Prithvi Theatre in July 2018, the playwright has plans to bring it back to the city in 2019 as well.

In 2018, the iconic theatre group Awishkar Theatre brought Aranya Kiran directed by Ajit Bhagat. The play, staged 10 years after the death of its late director-playwright Chetan Datar, is set in the Mahabharata. It revolves around a self-questioning Lord Krishna (played by Sushil Inamdar) in Dwarka. The string of monologues with various lead characters -- wife Rukmini, brother Balaram, foster parents Nand and Yashoda and lastly, mother-like Gandhari -- interrogate Krishna's trickery, political moves and worldview. The play is still being staged and the next show is in January itself.

A publishing house that started a reading movement back in the '70s, is set for a new innings to revive the language of its people. The publishing house was launched in 1974 by journalists Ashok Jain, Dinkar Gangal, Arun Sadhu and Kumar Ketkar, who created an informal organisation to spread the culture of reading among Marathi speakers. Over the years, it has seen several members come and go and even survived a slump.

Samir Bharadwaj conducts paper workshops across Mumbai where he teaches how to neatly slice paper, and fold it just right, so that you can create your own automatons and pop-up books. Even if you don't become skilled at it, hand-eye coordination in adulthood is good for you.

Suyash Rawat, a 32-year-old emergency medical practitioner, has set up Mumbai's first surf school, along with Krishna Lamani, who previously worked as an instructor at the Kovalam Surf Club. Rajori beach enjoys a kilometre-long stretch of grey sand and is a perfect place if you are still at an introductory stage. Call a day prior for weather conditions.

When Aneesh Bhasin, co-founder at Svami, told us his tonic water has 50 per cent fewer calories than Schweppes, its main competitor, we knew the way we had our gin and tonic was going to change forever. Made from quinine sourced from Congo, cucumber and lime from India, and grapefruit from the US, Bhasin has increased the carbonation over the months because ""Indians like their fizz"". Svami is getting ready to launch more flavours, and a ginger ale by February.

The backstory behind booze

What and Where: White Lady cocktail at The Bombay Canteen; Chanel No. 6 at House of Nomads; Sherlock In A Pickle at London Taxi; and Red Monsoon at Hakkasan

This year, Yash Bhanage, co-owner at The Bombay Canteen, and his research team soaked themselves in the history of single screen theatres as inspiration for cocktails. Not just them, several other bartenders tried to create a story out of their cocktails. For instance, Jiaan Kris J Lam, House of Nomads, created Chanel No. 6 (in pic) as an ode to the fashion house, and Ami Shroff at London Taxi, whipped up a Sherlock-inspired drink which stood out for its prominent notes of gherkin, tea and rose. Order a glass.

At, Harajuku, on Chapel Road, co-owner Saleha Bawazir wanted to bring the street food of Harajuku to Mumbai. So, the restaurant offers a wide range of sweet and savoury crepes; Dorayakis, palm-sized treats comprising a sweet filling sandwiched between two round cakes, among other things. Vikram Khatri, executive chef at Hello Guppy, also overhauled the menu to introduce a range of new items including caramelised popcorn with crispy bacon, beetroot rice cracker and tuna nachos pizza. ""Everybody knows about sushi and ramen. It was time to educate people that there's a lot more that comes from Japan,"" he says.

Inspired by the legendary wrestler, Mini Punjab introduced The Dara Singh thali on its menu this year. Not for the weak-hearted, it packs in the best of unlimited eating. It features 33 items, and includes aloo paratha, chur chur de naan, makki di roti, murg mussalam rice, lamb yoghurt curry, chicken Amritsari and more. If you're in for a man-versus-food contest, here's your best bet.

Development consultant Ragini Kashyap, who started Third Culture Cooks -- a multinational supper club -- likes to tell a story with a bite. Her venture, Bordered dinner, explores border conflict by pairing food with peoples' stories and history. We sampled the Tamil-Sinhala conflict in Sri Lanka, and returned knowing a lot more about our neighbour's culinary diversity.

If you are severely intolerant to gluten, there is a chance you have stayed away from vodka, which is made from wheat, barley, or rye. Well, Tito's Handmade Vodka that is produced in Austin at Texas's oldest legal distillery is now available in Mumbai. The drink is made using corn. Tito Beveridge, who came up with the recipe, distilled the corn mash six times, because it was believed that corn retains some of its smoothness even after distillation. The process of making the corn-based vodka is similar to that of the making of single malts and high-end French cognacs.

It's not every day that you come across pepper in your pannacota, which is why pastry chef Husna Jumani's timut-infused creamy Italian dessert is noteworthy. It's the pronounced flavour of the Nepalese pepper -- spicy with hints of grapefruit -- that propelled her to pick this as the hero ingredient. However, it is an acquired taste, she warns.

The ingredients of Du Rhone might be a well-kept secret, but not its stellar reputation. So when the 140-year-old gourmet chocolate brand opened their first store in May this year, we were the first to rush for a blind tasting evening. Our favourite was the Coline which is a dark ganache with 70 per cent cocoa beans from Brazil and Papua New Guinea.

The last one year saw a rise in the number of gourmet delivery joints in the city. The menu at these kitchens range from Bento Buddha bowls to coconut-panko crusted shrimps with orange and ginger dips. The food, then, is the biggest selling point. We'd recommend the Mis Malaysian Seafood Bisque from Hello Green.

The wandering Maharaj is invited for weddings and funerals, casual get-togethers and Diwali dos, any affair in which the party size is too significant for a regular cook, and when guests need to be impressed. Om Maharaj specialises in sweets, such as rasgulla and ghevar; and Lallan Maharaj, who has also trained in restaurants and five-stars for 13 years, can be trusted to pull off Italian and Chinese dishes convincingly. Lallan says, ""In this line of work, the person who knows his job, doesn't need the title. I have not kept my name maharaj. It's all of you who call me maharajji. So, now, it has become a surname.""

From kombucha to vegetable broth, mixologists discuss what you can replace your calorie-laden mixer with. The almond milk soda cocktail at Colaba's Bombay Vintage has an interesting backstory. Here, Sean Pereira, bar operations manager, uses doodh soda consumed by farmers in Peshawar to keep themselves hydrated.

A food service in Bandra has been made special by autistic students, who have donned chefs' hats to make the lunch break worthwhile. The students belong to the Support for Autistic Individuals (SAI), a charitable trust set up by Kamini Lakhani and her husband, Anil. The young autistic cooks need a fair amount of support. ""It will take them anywhere between one and eight months for them to understand all the steps,"" says Lakhani.

What can you expect when the power couple behind The Table teams up with the boys behind The Woodside Inn? Miss T, a gastro Asian cocktail bar and restaurant. Every cocktail we sampled was characterised by an adventurous, refreshing and comforting tag. The Quixotic (R850) came with peanut butter-infused Jim Beam bourbon, hints of saffron and orange bitters. In the food menu, we liked the chicken and tender coconut curry (R900) that came with pandan rice. The curry was light without lacking depth. We liked the food for its simple execution of flavours and lack of pretentiousness, which is just what an Asian meal should be.

One of Goa's most loved restaurants, House of Lloyd, made its Mumbai debut this year. We met the chef for a taste of the Goa-inspired menu. He has selected the choicest of dishes including rassa omelette, pork chops and clams masala. Now you know where to head for a susegad experience.

Chef Scott Linquist (who runs the Miami favourite Coyo Taco) and Jason Hudanish introduced chapulines or grasshoppers as an off-the-menu dish at Mexican restaurant Xico. The grasshoppers don't have a distinct taste and the texture is close to crunchy prawns. A rich source of protein, you can either eat the dried grasshoppers directly, or on tortilla.

Shunned by society, trans-women have found jobs sans judgment at Third Eye Café. We visited the restaurant to find a place that serves decent food, and the opportunity to the third gender to lead a respectable life. Spread over eleven pages, the menu offers Italian, Oriental and Indian cuisine.

A hoppumm is a marriage between Sri Lanka's hoppers, a type of fermented pancakes, and South Indian appams, and three school friends from Bombay Scottish brought it to Bandra this year. Hoppumm is a 15-seater restaurant, exuding architectural influences from Sri Lanka. The highlight is the bowl-shaped Sri Lankan pancakes filled with a range of fragrant curries. To make it flexible, they offer combinations where you can pair a base staple -- hopper, string hopper (idiyappam), neer dosa, paratha or kothu roti -- with a flavourful filling.

Mastani is a milkshake that comes topped with a dollop of hand-churned ice cream. Some people also add fresh cut fruits, dry fruits and whipped cream. It is believed that when guests tried it for the first time, they would exclaim 'masta'. It has become a part of Pune's food heritage, and you can now try it at a tiny dessert parlour in Vile Parle called Karandikar Mastani House. A simple store with a couple of chairs, this Mastani house offers eight flavours starting from mango to the interesting Irish pudding Mastani.

Chembur, the eastern suburb which last made headlines for a culinary reason in November 2016 when Matunga's iconic eatery Mani's Lunch Home moved here, is now in the midst of a hospitality boom. Want to spend a day indulging your cravings? Do it with as few steps as possible as you start off with Pot Pourri, Theobroma, then 99 Pancakes, Keventers, London Bubble Co, The Koffee Works, Wok Hei and then China Villa.

Did you know that the hair dryer, apart from blowing hair, can be used to relight charcoals on the grill, soften chocolate and frost cake? Chefs across Mumbai are putting non-kitchen items to good use. The stand out was Empresa Hotel chef Ajay Chopra's ingenious hack of using a coal iron to press a quesadilla. Book a table to see for yourself."

Some teachers have opposed this decision and have informed the education ministry to refine the current state of government-aided schools, instead of focussing on starting new ones.

The current state of government-aided schools is shoddy,"" averred teachers and principals alike. Various school principals have revealed that for several months, the government has stopped providing adequate funds, leading to a financial crisis. Maintenance charges, bills, basic supply lines and even salary payments have not been facilitated by the state.

More importantly, the syllabus and curriculum has not been revised for years, according to teachers. It is the same old pattern of teaching and rote learning, teachers lament. Sukhmani Pandey, a teacher said, ""The lessons, poems and chapters have been based on the same pattern for years. There is no addition of new technologies, experimental learning, personality skills, life lessons or practical concepts.""

Creative and interactive teaching-learning concepts are absent, as state-board curriculum is based on book learning and classroom lessons. Jasmeet Barbara, a teacher said, ""For want of a practical approach, we have to stick to textbooks for lessons, there is no way to explain concepts to students through life models. This makes learning boring for students, as their attention span is minimum and there is no creative input at all.""

Outdoor education, practical focus and interactive lessons will improve the standards of state board curriculum. Shabnam Quesreshi, a senior teacher said, ""If we add few elements like interactive and fun learning, outside classroom teaching and practical application of theories, then we can match the style of international curriculum. We should formulate and teach the syllabus according to the primary needs of students so that we make it fun for them and increase their interest in state board schools."""

What is your stand?

I have decided to put forth my ideas on the need to nationalise education from pre-primary till standard 7, which according to me is the only solution to address the issue of medium of instruction, and essential for the very survival of Indian languages. It is the mother tongue which makes our life meaningful. Our cultural beliefs and values are embedded in language. Language is the treasure trove of the dreams of people over thousands of years. I believe that learning Kannada properly will help in learning better English, German, French, or any other language.

I am told that the panel tasked with preparing the new National Education Policy (NEP) has completed its work. According to Union Minister for Human Resource Development, NEP will help in boosting all Indian languages. Let us see how the policy will help in addressing the issue of imparting education to children in their mother tongue.

Resolutions are the demands of Kannadigas. But the parishat is not a political organisation. I remember the words of Thomas Mann, Noble laureate and German writer, who said, ""In our time, the destiny of man presents its meaning in political terms."" If the government fails to lend its ears to Kannadigas' aspirations, then who will? It is the responsibility of the government to listen to them and prioritise them.

Political systems have become thick skinned. They won't bother even if you stop passing resolutions. The only available mechanism is that we have to make them implement resolutions much more intensely.

You cannot compare Akhila Bharata Kannada Sahitya Sammelana with other literary festivals. There is no need for the sammelana to change its format, as this sammelana is 'Askhara jatre', a fair of the letters. A fair is part of any diversified culture and there is no need to distort that format. According to me, literary festivals are just shows. They are characteristically pretentious. I would call them showrooms for writers to advertise themselves. A sammelana is a celebration, while a literary festival is a show.

For the moment I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, I am elated. Dharwad is a place where I studied and dreamt big. It is here that my poetic instincts flowered. At the same time, I am distressed, as my teacher, Bhoosanuru math, close friends M.M. Kalburgi and Giraddi Govindaraj are not in Dharwad now. Five of us -- Kalburgi, Giraddi, Siddalinga Pattanashetti, Chandrashekar Patil -- were considered the Pancha Pandavas. Our literary careers found real meaning in Dharwad. As a student, I participated in the sammelana chaired by Kuvempu, my beloved poet. I vividly remember [Da Ra] Bendre rendering his poem 'Karadi Kunitha' there in his classic style. I remember the days spent in the loft of Manohara Granthamala, the iconic publication, where literary personalities met regularly. I first met Girish [Karnad] there."

Emphasising on education, which is a yardstick for development, he asked the District Education Officer to set up digital classrooms in nine high schools, five upper primary schools and 16 primary schools so that rural children studying in government schools can get quality education on par with corporate educational institutions.

He asked the officials to set up infrastructure such as screens, projectors, CPU, mouse, speakers, tables and chairs in classrooms.

Over the last 4 years, the mission has picked up pace and as government says turned into a national movement, with people from all walks of life doing their bit. One of the key successes of the Abhiyan are the Swachh heroes who have emerged across India. Swachhgrahis, as they are now famous as, are swachh warriors who are championing the cause of sanitation and hygiene in India and giving the much need impetus to the programme and help sustain it.

PM Modi, in an event organised to conclude the campaign Champaran Satyagraha, 'Chalo Champaran - From Satyagraha to Swachhagraha' lauded the efforts by awarding ten Swachhagrahis (sanitation motivators) who have performed outstandingly in their villages and set a benchmark for others, this year. The swachhagrahis from across the country are promoting Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) to motivate the communities to adopt collective behaviour change.

This Swachhagrahi started his journey by building a toilet at his own home after a voluntary organisation gave a presentation in his village about the diseases that can spread due to open defecation. From there, Ramesh actively contributed to the process of making his village ODF and continued to support the Mandal administration in community mobiliSation activities. He acted as a role model by working with the community to ensure that toilet construction material is available.

His close engagement with the community helped him win their confidence for daily monitoring, resolving issues being faced during construction, reporting the ground level problems to the officials concerned and getting them resolved. Due to Ramesh's unwavering efforts, his district is ODF today, and they are witnessing decreasing health problems and increasing productivity. Thanks to Ramesh's efforts, the village now has 506 toilets from a mere 45 before he started his mission. Along with this, Chittoor district achieved ODF title this year on April 1 with construction of close to 4 lakh (3,80,339) toilets.

I built 400 toilets and to ensure that people make use of these toilets I used to visit common defecation spots, both in the morning and evening, of all the six villages in the gram panchayat. If someone was found defecating in the open, I would ask them the reason behind not using toilets and counsel them, says A. Ramesh.

Ateeq Ahmad is not only a Swachhata Champion, but also a behaviour change communication Champion. Hailing from Bijnor district in Uttar Pradesh, Ahmad, A teacher and professor by profession, is a proponent of CAS as he has trained and encouraged many other motivators. With the understanding that generic communication tools can't induce behaviour change, he created posters, booklets, brochures and more, using examples relatable to local culture and context. While his tools have created the necessary impact in his block, they are now being scaled up at the state level, especially the Swachhata song, a booklet on the 'Key Steps of Triggering' and a couple of short movies on the issue of sanitation.

I have always been passionate about the cause of cleanliness and hygiene and propagated the same to my students. When Swachh Bharat was launched I decided to put my thoughts into practice and make a difference in my district, he says.

Alamarathupatty village of Tamil Nadu is ODF only due to the unprecedented commitment and passion of S. Rajalakshmi, an active member of a self-help group. Rajalakshmi participated in numerous sanitation and interpersonal communication activities, and supported many motivators into Master Trainers. She promoted access to toilets as a right, and made community mapping and motivation as her primary tools. Her regular meetings with Village Poverty Reduction Committee (VPRC) members, and awareness drives in schools, led to public drives for toilet construction and usage.

She hails from Nalanda district, Bihar and is a passionate Swachhagrahi who was nominated for her hard work for achieving ODF status for her village, panchayat, and later 10 wards in the vicinity. A mobilisation activity towards facilitating the construction of toilets, that takes months, or even years was completed in just two months, thanks to Rinku's passion and motivation.

Her main aim was to change people's mind-set and make the community aware about the issues associated with Open Defecation. She held detailed discussions with mothers and elders in the village about the health and economic benefits of constructing and using toilets, successfully, driving a Jan Andolan to construct toilets across villages.

Last year, I attended one swachh bharat abhiyan workshop and that was it. Soon, I started taking more and more workshops in order to learn different techniques so that I can motivate people to construct a basic necessity - a toilet. The villagers are not trained to use a toilet at home, they need to be taught and taught well. If they will face problems, then they will start going out in the fields, as it is an easy option. To change this, wherever I go, I make sure, I am training villagers to construct their own toilet, how to use a toilet and how to keep it clean, Rinku told NDTV.

Morish Jaria took it upon himself to make his Panchayat ODF and fully dedicated himself to the cause of safe sanitation. The biggest challenge faced by his panchayat as well as the community was lack of road connectivity, which hampered availability of material for construction. By motivating the community, carrying materials himself using bullock carts or cycles and even by foot in the more remote areas, he actively led the change. He acted as A role model and encouraged his peers to make all possible efforts to construct toilet, and then use them. His selfless work was also recognised by the District Collector, Simdega.

Jupelli Neeraja is not only an active Swachhagrahi but also a passionate 'Sanitation Champion'. She did all that a Swachhagrahi should do to empower the community members to construct and use toilets. In the beginning, the emphasis was on motivation, mason training, group meeting, and interpersonal communication, and later she shifted the focus to community monitoring. Neeraja led from the front, inspired and personally monitored all the common places of open defecation in her village, every morning. To sustain this momentum, she motivated the villagers to install an innovative method of using two PVC Pipes (6 inches width 1.2 Mtrs. Length) to pour vegetable waste, and converted it to compost manure for homestead gardens & farms.

Monika Ijardar emerged as one of the most devoted supporters of Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS), a module introduced by the government focused towards rural India achieving ODF. This well-educated, young girl used the approach successfully to make her village and later the whole Gram Panchayat Open Defecation Free (ODF). But this fervent swachhagrahi didn't stop at that, she went ahead and used the same approach to mobilise the surrounding villages and Gram Panchayats. It was due to her unrelenting effort that 61 Gram Panchayats became ODF, and her block became the first in the district to become completely Open Defecation Free.

I tried motivating the women and girls of the house - with questions like 'how can you showcase your private areas to public like that', 'why don't you make a toilet, when you have an option. I have helped more than 1500 families, today they all are enjoying the benefits of having a toilet at home. I won't stop my fight, today I have made Raigarh free from open defecation, I will make sure more and more district get the benefit of a toilet, Monika told NDTV.

45-year-old farmer, Manilal used all the tools available in the armoury of a Swachhagrahi to catalyse behavioural change towards safe sanitation practices and toilet construction. Using motivation, interpersonal communication, village meetings, triggering, and awareness building activities he managed to bring about a huge difference.

He employed advocacy to promote safe (preferred) toilet construction technology viz. twin pit toilets. He turned the whole exercise into a ceremony - every morning, the Sarpanch and Nigrani Samiti members, accompanied by a priest visited households to mark the laying out of twin pit toilet (muhurath karna) construction. This novel practice motivated the households to construct toilets.

When we started the campaign, there were some 280 toilets in the village and we had to build over 700 toilets. I tell people to construct toilets, be disease free and save money on medicines, says Manilal Rana

Yeshi Wangmu's dedication towards the goals of Swachh Bharat Mission has motivated her to continue working to drive behavioural change in the villages of Jang Block - an area where the community members have long had a very negative attitude towards construction and use of toilets. Innumerable Gram-sabha meetings and Information Education and communication (IEC) activities were conducted to increase awareness and mobilise the community.

Not only for individual households, but she also sought wider cooperation from the Panchayati Raj Institution members to make IEC activities more effective. The village and Gram Panchayat are ODF today and the community members attribute this behaviour change to Yeshi's commitment to the cause.

Everyone has an ability to do something for the country. I didn't have any resource myself to bring about such a huge change, but I did make some contribution. All you need is dedication and desire to achieve something. I urge all of you who are sitting there, get up and simply talk to people. A lot can change, if you will start spreading the awareness to others, Yeshi told NDTV.

Bonti Saikia's never say die commitment towards making the village and Gram Panchayat ODF is something worth admiring. She left no stone unturned to ensure not just that each and every household had a toilet but used it. With education as her tool, Bonti started going door-to-door and started teaching people who didn't have a toilet at home about why it is important to get one and the basic rules to follow for a healthy life.

The methods used by Bonti Saikia were simple & persistent, adopted with the sole objective of making the society healthier and better. Today, her Gram Panchayat office is one of the cleanest and well-maintained in the district, and there has been significant decline in diarrhoea cases in the tea gardens of her Gram Panchayat."

With careers today not limited to traditional domains, there are a plethora of options to choose from. One such unconventional, albeit fulfilling, career option is that of a physiotherapist. Physiotherapy is a science related to health care that focuses on restoration of movement and function of various body parts. Physiotherapists help diagnose and treat patients of all ages suffering from health problems or conditions that limit their mobility and affect their day-to-day activities. They also work with individuals to develop fitness and promote general well-being as part of a healthier and active lifestyle.

Healthcare services

A person who has undergone training as part of a graduate, postgraduate, or doctoral programme in the science of physiotherapy is eligible to take this up as a profession. To pursue this course, one must have a background in life sciences such as biology and anatomy, or a foundation in psychology or sociology. Higher degree programmes like masters or doctoral studies in the field of physiotherapy give candidates in-depth knowledge and a vivid analysis of various aspects of this science.

Physiotherapists are an essential part of the healthcare delivery system and play an important role in rehabilitation and other programmes that promote health and fitness in both professional as well as social communities. They are not only the providers of health but are also responsible for uplifting their patients from the mental trauma and pain associated with restricted movement and physical functioning.

Some roles and responsibilities of a physiotherapist are:

Diagnose and manage dysfunctional physical movement.

Promote improvement of all-round mobility and specific physical functions.

Work towards restoring, maintaining, and enhancing physical movement and optimal functions.

Promote overall well-being and fitness to ensure good quality of life.

Prevent and treat symptomatic progression of impaired physical movement, functional limitations, disabilities related to diseases, disorders, conditions, injuries or post-operative recovery.

Options

Clinical physiotherapists: They provide care to patients with activity limitations and impairments/ailments of any kind. They collaborate with other healthcare providers to address needs such as communication and the provision of effective and efficient treatment assistance. At a clinical level, they provide end-to-end care for patients, and undertake their assessment and treatment.

Engagement care officer: In this role, physiotherapists reach out to old patients who may be at risk of a relapse. By making sure that they follow the recommended exercise routine, they help ensure patients' long-term well-being.

Clinical and non-clinical roles: Other roles that physiotherapists can assume include consultation, education, research, and administration. Some may be a part of the quality control team as well and others can undertake key leadership roles in the business management vertical to ensure smooth functioning of a healthcare delivery centre.

Other options: Professionals with a degree/ diploma in physiotherapy have many job opportunities in India -- in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centres, and private clinics. With the advent of home healthcare services, physiotherapy services are also provided at home and offices. Physiotherapists also have ample prospects in out-patient departments of hospitals, clinics, community and primary health centres, health clubs, fitness centres, occupational health centres, schools for differently-abled children, and senior citizen centres. Since physiotherapy is also an important part of sports injury recovery programmes, physiotherapists find jobs in sports medicine and rehabilitation centres, too.

Prospects

Professionals in India with a degree in physiotherapy complemented by excellent soft skills such as teamwork, good communication, and critical thinking may earn anywhere between ₹8,000 and ₹15,000 per month as freshers.

While the remuneration varies with the company and set up, it also depends on the level of qualification and the college.

As candidates move higher on the experience ladder, the pay packages also get better. The growth in pay scale also largely depends on the professional abilities and the potential of the physiotherapist.

New Delhi: Shais Khan, a 23-year-old masseur from Delhi, has a dream. He wants to be the next Sunny Leone, an unabashed porn star not confined to the seedy underbelly that is the world of Indian adult cinema today.

""I'm crazy about my dream,"" Shais, now a regular in Indian porn productions, told ThePrint. ""I don't have words to explain how crazy I am.""

Shais' introduction to porn came five years ago, when he took up a job at a spa owned by French nationals. ""I have been working here for five years, so my owners used to show me French (porn) videos..."" he said.

The idea of performing porn instantly intrigued Shais, who began filming adult videos with the help of friends.

""There's a profession for everything. There are schools for teachers and parlours for beauticians, but there isn't a porn industry in India, so those who want to pursue this profession have to find a way around it,"" Shais said.

While he has become a recognisable face in the Indian gay porn industry, Shais is waiting for porn to be legalised in the country, when he would be able to show off his ""diverse skill set"".

Studies show the Indian market is big enough to make porn a viable career option for the likes of Shais.

The sixth annual review conducted by Pornhub, released recently, showed that Indians love to watch porn, with the country accounting for the third highest daily traffic to the adult video site in 2018, behind only the US and the UK.

The same report suggested that nothing gets Indians quite as excited as seeing other Indians having sex: For the second year in a row, top searches for Indians contained the words 'Indian' or 'Hindi'.

Pari Tomar, a YouTube star, made big bucks off soft-porn videos (a less sexually explicit variant) until March 2016, when significant changes to the portal's monetisation and content policies rendered cleavage shots and heavy panting unprofitable.

""I used to work about 20-25 days a month, sometimes acting in up to eight short films a day,"" she told ThePrint. While it was allowed, Pari charged Rs 15,000 for a day of work. ""But now those films don't get produced anymore, [as] they tell me they were getting too vulgar for the internet. So I do mostly comedy.""

Richa Kaul Padte, author of Cyber Sexy: Rethinking Pornography, said Indians were looking for sexual content featuring Indians online. ""And because we don't have a porn industry in India, this demand is being fulfilled either by brown actors in American/Western porn, and by homemade porn -- which is made, either consensually or non-consensually -- by regular people in India,"" she added.

However, Indian policy, experts say, has often been out of step with this reality.

Despite the fact that the demand for well-produced Indian porn is growing every year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) banned over 800 websites offering adult content in October, the censor board sanitises sexuality in Bollywood movies, and Section 67 of the IT Act criminalises ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" with imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.

The reasons span from moral objections, to the belief that porn is a major driver of sexual crime, as evidenced in the Uttarakhand High Court order that led to the TRAI directive.

But experts and industry insiders say such bans deprive the country of a vast revenue source, while potentially turning a willing audience to portals offering illegal content.

""All the money is basically going into the pockets of international companies,"" said Yash Juneja, a Jharkhand-based music store owner who also makes semi-porn films for private clients.

""They come shoot here, or Indians upload porn on their sites, and they earn all the advertisement and subscriber-based revenue,"" he added.

The true potential of porn in India remains unexplored: Some estimates peg the global porn industry's worth at $97 billion. The US, where porn is legal and users accounted for the highest daily traffic to Pornhub in 2018, is said to alone have a porn industry worth $10-12 billion.

Goutham Shivshankar, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court, told ThePrint that the ""the primary target in Indian law is 'obscenity' and not 'pornography', except child pornography, which is specifically and separately dealt with under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000"".

While Section 67 of the Act rules ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" a punishable offence, viewing or storing pornography in India is not illegal.

This means that you can make a sex tape and store it on your phone, and you are clear legally as long as you don't upload it on a website or distribute it via email, WhatsApp or any other digital platform.

""If India legalises porn, we would stand out as the largest consumers of porn in the world,"" Vaibhav, an IT-consultant-turned-director who has worked on porn films, told ThePrint.

Legalising porn, he said, will ensure that India matches international standards, with the ensuing influx of capital and investment likely to bring Indian porn and its local purveyors out of the shadows and help them carve their own niche.

""The actors there (in the West) are doing it out of their own will. There is no desperation for money attached to it,"" he said.

""Jisko bhook lagi hui hai na, voh dhoondhta rahega jab tak uski bhook nahi mitti hai (A person hungering for something will continue to look for it till his desire is not satiated),"" said Vaibhav.

He said legalisation will also help throttle exploitative sex. ""Porn should be legalised... at least in the name of craft and art, because someone will not get molested,"" he added.

One of the most substantial arguments in favour of legalisation rests on consent. At least in perception, the porn industry has been globally linked with human trafficking, rape and assault, and the dehumanisation of women as sex objects.

But Padte argues that decriminalisation will prevent such exploitation.

""There are so many reasons why decriminalisation is a good idea,"" she told ThePrint, ""From distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual content to creating safe spaces for sexuality to developing a range of sexual expressions -- but I guess I would boil it down to the fact that criminalising sexual expression is a really bad idea.""

""It doesn't 'protect' anyone,"" she added. ""All it does is push the whole thing underground, which means that where violence does take place, we don't have mechanisms in place to address it.""

As it stands today, the porn industry in India largely works under the disguise of various ""legitimate"" professions - Several photographers, modelling agencies, massage parlours and smaller production houses supplement their day jobs with the recession-proof padding that porn provides.

Aungshita Chatterjee, 43, has dreams of becoming an international boudoir photographer, and while her aim may be a legal one, she tells ThePrint that ""at some point, a lot of the other photographers discovered that their DSLRs come with an in-built video option"".

""So yes, porn is being made -- in bedrooms and guest houses and studios, and it's uploaded on international servers or sold to clients from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Russia, and the United Kingdom through brokers,"" she said.

According to Aungshita, who says she was also once offered $75,000 by an American producer named Cedric to shoot a porn film with Indian models, the porn industry is pan-India, with behind-the-scenes producers operating from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and ""especially the south"".

But TRAI bans websites with pornographic content that are hosted on Indian domains -- so where does one upload these films?

According to Sameer, a Chennai-based filmographer who acts as the logistical matchmaker between a porn producer and a model in south India, Indians have found a way to circumvent even that obstacle. ""Everything is uploaded on Twitter, Tumblr and xvideos,"" he told ThePrint. When asked what happens in these movies, he said, ""Direct sex.""

South India is where the money is, added Juneja, because actors are easier to source, more willing to take risk on screen, and ""less likely to throw tantrums or be afraid of backlash from society"".

Sameer said at least a hundred such movies are produced monthly in the south, with actors getting paid up to Rs 50,000 per movie. The films are usually 50 minutes long and the whole production costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

However, much of Indian porn is defined by hand-held cameras, mobile phones balanced against a wall, mirrors, and low resolution, which doesn't seem to be satisfying viewers increasingly seeking out high-definition content.

According to the Pornhub report, 'HD' or 'high-definition' emerged as a popular keyword in searches keyed in by Indians.

In response to a report on ThePrint about the Pornhub review, a Reddit user claimed he had been ""looking for Desi HD for about ten years. It's just not there"".

""The best you get is a guy/gal with a good mobile phone,"" he wrote.

Everything apart, experts and insiders say the consequences of an underground industry can be severe. Informal productions don't entitle actors to health check-ups, salary standards, or protection from exploitation.

Even someone like Shais, who says that his years in the sex industry had forced him to develop a thick skin, knows everyone cannot be trusted.

He recalls paying a friend Rs 30,000 for a film he was told would be shot with good equipment.

But a few days after the payment, the friend disappeared. His phone was switched off and the money was gone.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

Kushwaha joined the JD(U) at the party office in the presence of party's state unit President Bashishtha Narayan Singh, Education Minister Krishnandan Prasad Verma and others along with his hundreds of workers and office-bearers of RLSP.

His exit from RLSP may prove to be another jolt for Upendra Kushwaha as his three legislators- Sudhanshu Shekhar, Lalan Paswan and Sanjeev Shyam Singh (ML)- have already announced that they would chart a different path than that of the party head Upendra Kushwaha.

Out of RLSP's three MPs, Jehanabad MP Arun Kumar is a dissident, while Sitamarhi MP Ram Kumar Sharma is with the RLSP chief. Upendra Kushwaha is the third MP of the party.

The opposition of the former Chief Minister over this issue had indicated there is no clarity and consensus over many issues among coalition partners according to observations from political pundits.

Speaking after distributing books free-of-cost to the readers at the programme organised by Kannada Book Development Authority yesterday, he said he would discuss with Chief Minister in this regard to get sort out this issue as various eminent Kannada writers and activists urging the State Government to withdraw the decision and to teach English only as a language from primary classes.

Siddaramaiah had also took to Twitter to criticise the decision of the CM, saying, ""I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I an idiot?""

In the first tweet on last Thursday evening, Siddaramaiah wrote: ""We should have clarity on learning Kannada language and Kannada medium (of instruction). I have studied in Kannada medium till high school. Am I (Has it made me) an idiot? Kannada should be the sovereign language in Karnataka.""

Following the meeting, the writers had decided to send a delegation led by Kannada Sahitya Parishat President Manu Baligar to meet the CM and urge him to withdraw the decision. They had threatened to launch an agitation against the government if their demands were not fulfilled.

After the police authorities recovered the carcasses, a post-mortem examination was conducted which confirmed that the cows died of asphyxia.

Meanwhile, the residents of Iglas have raised the issue of increase in the population of stray cattle which was causing inconvenience to them. Besides destroying the crops, such non-lactating, old and ailing cows lead to road accidents. However, the ban imposed on cow slaughter by the authorities and pro-active cow vigilante groups had made the life difficult for local residents.

Chief minister H D Kumaraswamy has already announced in the budget speech that English will be introduced as a medium of instruction in 1000 schools from the next academic year. His decision has led to a huge backlash from Kannada activists, who have expressed fears that it will deprive the children knowledge of the local language.

After several prominent Kannada activists and other public personalities met him and requested that he reconsider, Kumaraswamy reluctantly agreed to put the decision on hold till a wider consultation is over.

Now former chief minister and Congress legislative party leader Siddaramaiah has reopened the debate by wading into the sensitive and controversial issue.

On Thursday, he attacked Kumaraswamy for his inflexible attitude towards Kannada and demanded that the proposal to make English the medium of instruction be dropped immediately.

Speaking to News18, he said, ""The primacy of Kannada in Karnataka is non-negotiable. Kannada is everything in Karnataka. I won't allow English medium primary schools run by the government. I will speak to the chief minister"".

A day later on Friday, the chief minister's elder brother and PWD minister HD Revanna hit back at Siddaramaiah, and defending the introduction of English in government-run schools.

Revanna said that English was the need of the hour and a global necessity. ""The knowledge of English is important. It helps our rural and poor children to compete with city children. They can get better jobs, can go abroad and it will be good for all in the long run. If the government introduces English medium in schools, poor parents don't need to pay exorbitant fees at private schools,"" he said.

He also lashed out at the Kannada activists for their hypocrisy. ""The same people send their children and grandchildren to English medium schools. They oppose when the government introduces English as a medium for the benefit of the poor and village children"".

Some Kannada activists clarified that they are not against teaching English as one of the subjects from the first standard and their opposition is only to introducing English as a medium of instruction. In their defence, they cite the Supreme Court judgment in favour of primary education in the mother tongue of the child.

Siddaramaiah, who is a fierce defendant of Kannada language and culture, is unlikely to change his stand and it may worsen the already strained relationship between him and Kumaraswamy.

According to JDS leaders, Kumaraswamy has taken it as a matter of prestige and not willing to drop the proposal.

The main opposition BJP is also opposing the move. Former chief minister BS Yeddyurappa told News18 that he was for teaching English as one of the subjects in primary schools and not in favour of English medium government schools."

The civil supplies department, set up in 1918 when thousands of people fell victim to frequent episodes of famine, completed 100 years in August. The landmark event, though, went completely unnoticed. There were occasions when several pockets of princely Hyderabad state ran out of food stocks. Rice supplies, then, were rationed at 50 grams per head per day and it was increased to 100 grams only in 1950.

The pandemic flu of 1918 resulted in the decline of Hyderabad city population by 9.4% -- the population of Hyderabad state in the 1921 census was lower than that of 1911. There were more deaths than births and the decadal population dropped from 1.33 crore in 1911 to 1.24 crore in 1921. The flu which struck in September 1918 killed 46.5 people per 1000 that month and the death toll increased rapidly to 464 deaths per 1000 by Octoberend. Two per cent (3.50 lakh) of Hyderabad's population had been wiped out within a month.

2018 was also the year when the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), set up as Beri-Beri Enquiry Unit at Coonoor in Tamil Nadu, turned

100. It was shifted to Hyderabad in 1958.

Also completing a century was the Hyderabad Currency Act 1918 which introduced paper money for the first time. Earlier, only coins were in use. The Act came into force on June 4, 1918.

The Osmania University was also set up in 1918 though the institute celebrated the centenary in 2017.

While exams went online, campuses erupted with unrest and agitation

From reforms to resentment, 2018 was a mixed bag for students and parents. After almost two decades since its inception, common entrance tests such as Eamcet, ICET among others went online for those seeking admission to various professional courses.

In a major development, Telangana joined the national pool for medical courses by earmarking 15% of MBBS seats and 50% of postgraduate medical seats to students from other states.

What rocked Hyderabad this year was a string of student protests reported from top institutions such as Birla Institute of Technology Science, Tata Institute of Social Science, apart from other engineering colleges such as Vasavi College of Engineering, Chaitanya Bharati Institute of Technology etc. Their demands ranged from fee regulation to continuation of courses.

Those in school found no respite from the spiralling fee structure as the state government for the first time ordered school managements to maintain status-quo on the fee hike and issued an admission notification. Subsequently, on January 22, the Hyderabad High Court issued an interim order allowing schools to hike fee, leaving parents fuming. It was only closer to the end of year that the Delhi Public School, Mahendra Hills, decision to slash fee by 50% brought them some hope.

Apart from fees, two alleged cases of sexual abuse of primary students reported from a private school in Tolichowki, added to the angst of parents who demanded better surveillance in educational institutions.

City set to get an AIIMS, but will H1N1 deaths stop?

Right at the beginning, the government found itself in a spot with maternal deaths showing a three-fold jump since 2016-2017.

The core Hyderabad district itself reported as many as 105 maternal deaths compared to just 31 in 2017.

A worried healthcare department put all heads together and managed to bring things under control by strengthening government hospitals and introducing several health schemes, including KCR Kits, where pregnant women were given financial assistance in instalments towards the end of the year.

Fee regulation among several other issues triggered protests from students at top institutes such as TISS, BITS and many others

The maternal mortality rate (MMR) now stands at 70 female deaths per 100,000 live births. But right through the year, the government struggled to contain the deadly swine flu (H1N1) virus, with 154 deaths officially recorded till October this year and with 90% cases reported in Hyderabad city itself. If the battle to control the mutated virus was an uphill task, the dengue virus with 2,700 deaths and malaria with 1,500 deaths, underscored the government's failure to tackle diseases in Hyderabad. The health department also struggled to create more jobs and depute doctors and other necessary staff to rural areas, forcing patients to flock to Hyderabad's hospitals.

On a positive note, the decision to renovate the heritage block of the iconic Osmania General Hospital and build a new hospital premises, came as a welcome move. On December 20, Telangana received happy tidings, when the Union cabinet finally clearing the decks for the establishment of a new All India Institute for Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Bibinagar, at a cost of Rs 1,028 crore. The new prestigious facility spread over 200 acres will also have 100 MBBS seats.

Within minutes, they were hooked to the story of a young boy climbing up, and learning how to come down. They slowly stitched together the simple words, read them aloud and figured out the rest from Deval Maniar's large illustrations.

The story had appeared on a split screen -- the Bengali version, their mother tongue, on one side, and English and Hindi on the other. The exercise was meant to prune their mother tongue skills and familiarise the Std 1 students with English. ""Most of the students are first- and second-generation learners,"" says Dam. ""It is difficult to get them to speak in English. They understand the language, but lack the confidence to converse in it.""

Dam, along with many other teachers, is trying to engage children with languages through stories. His aide in this exercise is StoryWeaver, an online repository of stories for children. Started in 2015 by Pratham Books, a not-for-profit publisher of children's books, StoryWeaver is not just a virtual library but is also viewed differently by diverse groups.

If Dam sees it as a teaching tool that opens up story chests for his students, Chetan Acharya, president of the Konkani Bhasha Mandal (KBM), looks at it as a medium to save small languages. To artist and traveller Sarayu Kamat, StoryWeaver books are the way to connect with a community. For language-based organisations and translation practitioners, it is a vast pool of resources.

It offers over 10,000 stories for children in 124 languages, including Bhoti (spoken in Ladakh), Kumaoni (in Uttarakhand), Santali (in eastern India) and Gondi (in south-central India) and foreign languages such as Kurdish, Afrikaans and Haitian Creole. The content on the website is available on open licence, making it free for anyone to translate it into any language. For instance, I Can Climb is available in 60 versions and 47 languages including Thai, Vietnamese, Khmer, Sinhala and Norwegian. Dam himself has translated over 25 stories on the platform -- from English and Hindi to Bengali and vice versa.

""The purpose of StoryWeaver is to create a reading ecosystem, driven by the ideas of inclusion and collaboration,"" says Himanshu Giri, CEO Pratham Books. Anyone can access the site or use the content for free. Translators, publishers and other organisations who make content available on StoryWeaver do so without charging a fee.

Free access separates StoryWeaver from the rest. Giri admits keeping the medium open-source is complicated when there are authors, illustrations and publishers on board. ""Asking any established author or illustrator to give away rights is tough. I call myself the copyleft model,"" quips Giri. Yet, StoryWeaver has managed to do so. On the upside, the platform offers authors and illustrators a reach that copyrighted material often does not have.

Bengaluru-based Pratham Books got a hint of the unprecedented reach of online stories when it put up material on open licence in 2009. It uploaded some 20 titles on a CC (creative commons) licence platform, on which a work can be freely shared, translated, altered and so on. ""Over a year, 20 became 100 with derivatives in multiple languages. Our books were being used to teach English in Tokyo, they were being translated online into Hebrew and Zulu,"" says Giri.

StoryWeaver thrives on collaboration, and has managed to create a larger community bound by stories. ""Some partnerships have evolved organically. Someone interested in translating a story into his/her mother tongue would approach us,"" says Giri. On the other hand, the platform has generated interest among diverse advocacy groups working in education, literacy and health, spurring partnerships and generating stories in local languages. The focus in StoryWeaver is on underserved, local languages. ""At the time of Independence we had over 2,600 languages, we are left with 700 now,"" points out Giri.

The platform attempts to push back at least a few languages from the brink of disappearance through local interventions. ""Technology will not help us scale unless people help us. Language is such a thing that needs human involvement,"" he adds.

Others -- such as governments and organisations -- are sitting up and taking note of StoryWeaver. The Arunachal Pradesh government has asked Pratham Books to establish libraries in government schools. ""Around 400 classrooms are digitally equipped,"" says Giri. CGnet Swara, the online voice portal that allows people in the central tribal belt to report local news, partnered with the platform to translate stories into Gondi. The website has over 250 stories in the language now.

Purvi Shah, Head, Digital Initiatives, Pratham Books, says the call to preserve a local language through stories often comes from the community. Suchana, an organisation working on child welfare and literacy in West Bengal, partnered with StoryWeaver to translate stories into Santali and Kora, another indigenous community language spoken in the region. ""Suchana evangelised the idea of translating from Bengali into these languages; now we have over 84 resources in Santali and Kora on the platform,"" says Shah.

As the partnership between Suchana and StoryWeaver has grown, so has the link of Santal and Kora communities with their stories. Since readers were often in remote areas, translated stories were downloaded in PDF format, saved on devices and taken to the grassroots. To make it effective in areas without internet access, the platform allows stories to be saved offline. ""Suchana has raised funds to print these stories into books,"" Shah says. It is making the stories accessible to Bengali-speaking teachers so that they can, in turn, spread the Santali books within the Santal communities and widen the reader base, she adds.

Shah calls it the ""ripple effect"", where a child warms up to the idea of reading, slowly sheds the fear of words and graduates to reading more. ""The goal is to create a large repository of mother tongue resources and instil in children the joy of reading in their language. That is why we never digress from stories,"" adds Shah.

The KBM's association with StoryWeaver is over two years old and has resulted in nearly 120 stories being translated into Konkani. ""Children should get a chance to read and think in their mother tongue. This is a small effort to save a language,"" says Acharya of KBM. Konkani, among the 22 languages that are a part of Schedule Eight of the Constitution and written in five different scripts, was waiting for a boost that would connect it with the young.

""Stories are one way of doing it,"" Acharya says. At the primary and secondary school run by the KBM in Madgaon, students were trained to browse and read on StoryWeaver. The mandal also conducted a workshop for schoolteachers, training them to use the platform and even try their hand at translation. Pratham Books and KBM together printed 50 translated titles. ""We made 500 copies of each book, and distributed them for free in 250 schools,"" Acharya adds.

StoryWeaver has also forayed into languages that barely have a history of children's literature. Earlier this year, it held a hackathon in Haryana by bringing together schoolteachers from 20 government schools to translate children's stories into Haryanvi, a language that closely resembles Hindi but does not boast a strong literary tradition. ""It is a deep-rooted oral language, and yet the schoolteachers who came for the hackathon did not remember reading a Haryanvi story growing up,"" says Amna Singh, associate language editor at Pratham Books. When a language begins to fade out of official use, it's considered an early marker of a bleak future. ""Documenting it is the best way to keep a language alive,"" Singh says.

At the two-day event, teachers were trained on the nuances of translating for children. They translated 74 stories from Hindi to Haryanvi, peer-reviewed and polished each other's work, and enhanced the StoryWeaver pool. The experience emboldened the team to conduct a second hackathon in Kolkata, this time bringing together language experts, students of literature and schoolteachers. The exercise had participants splitting their hair on how to aptly translate ""You are being silly, Mr Brown"" into Bengali.

""They animatedly discussed the most suitable translation for 'silly',"" Singh recalls.

Participants with different skill sets made the exercise vibrant. ""The schoolteachers were game changers. They were the closest to the children and would not allow a story to be sanitised,"" she adds. The teachers argued that if a story was cleansed to speak a language the children were unfamiliar with, it would never lure them to the classroom.

Collaborations at StoryWeaver have often extended into foreign shores and the Philippines-based QwertyWorks, a professional translation group, is one such international ally. ""We uploaded our very first book from StoryWeaver in April this year,"" says Jake Irwin Estrada, founder and CEO. In a matter of months, the group translated 67 books from the platform -- 23 were translated into Tagalog and 44 into Cebuano -- two languages spoken in the Philippines. ""We are currently working on translating more books into secondary Philippine languages such as Hiligaynon, Ilokano, Bikolano, and Tausug and Maranao,"" adds Estrada.

While most stories remain online, Estrada keeps a limited number of printed books to be distributed among children who attend public day-care centres near his office in Manila. ""Some of these children don't have enough money to buy food for school, let alone books,"" says Estrada. The children, he says, are shocked when they receive books in their native language, and are allowed to take them home. ""They end up receiving from us the first book that they will ever own,"" he adds.

StoryWeaver boasts a handful of ""champions"" -- people who have translated hundreds of stories into a particular language for free. And then there are those like Sarayu Kamat who have taken the stories into the community. On a recent trip to Bastar, she took with her 200 stories in Gondi, each of them printed in colour on A4 sheets and spiral bound into small books. ""We visited several houses in Kanker and distributed the books. We also donated some to the local school library,"" Kamat says. She shares pictures of young Manisha, who belongs to the Muria tribe in Chhattisgarh, enjoying the Gondi book Kamat had gifted her.

As the portal scales new milestones such as breaching the 10,000-story mark, Giri wants the community to own it: ""We want people to run it. We want publishers to join this."" Even if for-profit publishers would share their backlist (older books from a publisher) on StoryWeaver, he says, it would go a long way.

""The goal next year is to get a few known children's publishers from India on board,"" he says. ""If people own it, they will value it more."""

Some of the classroom teachings of several teachers have already been recorded. More such classes would also be recorded in the coming days in different subjects by the teachers, sources said.

Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja's Facebook page 'I am for Alleppey' is helping rehabilitate those affected in the flood-battered state.

Bengaluru: In August, when severe floods ravaged Kerala, killing 433 people and causing damage worth Rs 40,000 crore, the relief and rescue efforts, particularly by the local fishermen, were hailed by everyone.

One of the earliest, and biggest, rescue missions -- ""Operation Kuttanad"" -- was led by state Finance Minister Thomas Isaac and Alappuzha sub-collector Krishna Teja Mylavarapu. The alertness and quick response shown by this officer and his team in evacuating and moving people to safer zones saved the lives of nearly 2 lakh people in the Kuttanad area of Alleppey, which was the worst affected by the flood.

After the rescue operations, the young, dynamic IAS officer shifted focus to rehabilitation and launched ""I am for Alleppey (IAFA)"" on Facebook, the first crowd funding-based social media initiative that has been successfully helping locals rebuild their lives.

The campaign team is close to building nearly 500 homes and provided for infrastructure for schools and hospitals, largely in the Kuttanad area. Businessmen and celebrities have come forward to help and donate, giving people cattle and ensuring safe potable water.

On 24 December, the initiative marked 100 days of its launch.

During the rescue operations, Teja realised how crucial social media could be when several images and messages were circulated on it. He decided to use Facebook to seek help.

""During a crisis, the focus of the people and government is usually concentrated on rescue. But after one tides over the crisis, the focus is lessened during rehabilitation (sic). That is when I realised that it is important to concentrate on rehabilitation,"" Teja told The Print, explaining the rationale behind the initiative.

""I thought we would bring some campaign which gives some momentum for the work we have done. That is why I launched 'I am for Alleppey'. This initiative works in tandem with government programmes and adds value to efforts put (in) by all of us,"" he said.

When the page was shared among Teja's friends the day it was launched -- on 14 September -- within six hours, a woman from Kerala, who was living in Andhra Pradesh, agreed to adopt a primary health centre in Kuttanad. ""This was our first success story,"" said Teja.

Teja's Facebook page has built up an impressive following since then, and has been liked by more than 96,000 people.

""I am for Alleppey"" has been conducting several rehabilitation programmes:

Officials found during a survey that despite extensive rescue operations, nearly 500 animals were lost. This was a severe setback for the 133 families in Kuttanad who were completely dependent on livestock for their livelihood. This initiative helped generate interest among those who wanted to donate a cow to the dairy farm owners.

The process is simple. IAFA volunteers identify healthy cows in the district or nearby areas. When a donor approaches them through the Facebook page, a price lower than the market rate is quoted. Once the price is fixed, the cow is handed over to a beneficiary identified by the IAFA team. This way the dairy farmer benefits directly.

""We ensure that it is a healthy and insured cow, preferably one that is pregnant so that it would not stress the farmer,"" says Teja. ""Every cow is screened and insured for a year. There are already 120 people who are ready to donate cows and we have already donated 66 cows.""

He emphasises that the IAFA ensures it sources the cattle from Kerala and not from neighbouring states such as Tamil Nadu, so that that revenue generated remains within the state.

Kuttanad faced two successive floods and schoolchildren lost out on three months of their academic year. Attendance fell and classrooms were empty. The IAFA provided notebooks, schoolbags and water bottles for children as incentives to go to school.

The move worked. By 14 November, three months after the floods, 40,000 students were back in government schools in Alleppey.

In Kuttanad, the anganwadis also grappled with another problem after the deluge -- that of drinking water contamination. The IAFA came to the rescue, fitting water filters free of cost to ensure clean drinking water.

The team from the blockbustre film Baahubali was the first to promise to build five houses in the area. Later, many others stepped in. By the end of January, the team expects 500 houses to be built.

Telugu cine star Allu Arjun adopted 10 anganwadis while organisations such as the Ramakrishna Mission, Save the Children and Andhra Pradesh Unaided Schools Management Association provided for schoolbooks and other basic facilities. Of 99 anganwadis, 50 have been adopted till date.

Stressing on dignity for widows, the IAFA refers to their families as women-headed ones. It believes these families require extra help as it is even more difficult for them to rebuild their lives. About 6,000 such families have befitted and received kitchen and other household articles, campaign workers say.

The IAFA has organised medical camps and provided two months' free medicine, food and protein supplements to benefit nearly 4,000 elderly people in the area.

Several specially-abled persons lost equipment such as hearing or visual aids during the floods. IAFA volunteers visited the houses of such people and gathered a list of their requirements. After registering with the local primary health centres, nearly 6,000 people were provided equipment free of cost.

The worst-hit roads in Alleppey were mapped and identified to assess the extent of damage to trees. After a detailed study, 400 saplings were planted to help rebuild the green cover.

The IAFA provided free nets to the local fishermen.

Rameshan, a cattle farmer from lower Kuttanad's Kainakari panchayat, lost most of his livestock. He is a beneficiary of the ""Donate a Cow"" campaign.

""I am happy that I can sell this milk and feed my family. I don't understand what this internet and Facebook is. But I know that through Krishna Teja sir, I have been given a cow sponsored by a Good Samaritan. We are very thankful,"" he said.

Shiny V, headmistress of the KK Kumarapilla Smaraka Government High school in Karumady, Alleppey district, recalls how badly affected her school was.

""We wanted to encourage children to come back to school and instill reading habit in them. There was no space to keep such books and (I) requested for almirahs. I met sub-collector Krishna Teja sir who at that time asked me the condition of our computer lab.... it was in bad shape..."" says Shiny V.

""In less than an hour, he (Teja) said he will provide us funds worth Rs 2 lakh. With that money we bought four laptops, 11 chairs, two printers and furnishings for the computer room. We are indebted to our sponsor AP Unaided Schools Association who provided us infrastructure for our school,"" she adds.

C.S. Balachandra, founder of Abhaya Foundation, is among the organisations helping with construction of houses.

""Instead of distributing only relief material, we wanted to involve ourselves in a more constructive way. After consulting with three sets of engineering experts from Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Kerala, we found a 'flood-resistant construction module' which costs close to Rs 6 lakh per unit. On an experimental basis, we are building five homes in the Thirumala and Nehru Trophy wards,"" he said.

The efforts by Teja and his team have received positive feedback on social media, and have been appreciated by both the state and the central governments.

""I am for Allepey is an endeavour in addition to the rehabilitation programmes by the Kerala government. We are only additionally facilitating to help maximum impact in our small way... I only hope that in times of need or calamity, people get together and help one another, during and after,"" says the IAS officer."

The post mortem report of the animals, dug out from a field near a canal on Aligarh-Mathura Road, confirmed that they died of 'asphyxia', though police claimed that only dead cows had been buried at that particular spot.

According to eye witness, the district administration and local police officials rushed to the site with an earth-mover on Thursday morning after some local residents informed them that they had seen animal parts poking out of the ground which seemed freshly dug up. The incident came a day after Iglas residents locked hundreds of stray cattle in primary, upper primary schools and health centres on Wednesday in a bid to save their crops.

Local residents told TOI that after animal body parts were spotted sticking out of the ground, a large number of villagers reached there and started digging the area. By the time police reached the spot, the local residents had already dug out five cows. They claimed that one of them was alive and died later.

A resident told TOI on the condition of anonymity that the police personnel who initially arrived at the scene sent the five dug out cattle to veterinary hospital and wanted to leave after cleaning the spot. However, they brought a JCB after angry villagers demanded that more area with loose sand should be dug up. The operation led to the recovery of seven more cows.

According to Aligarh's chief veterinary officer, Dr KP Varshney, post mortem was conducted on 12 cows and the report indicated that they had died of ""asphyxia"" (body deprived of oxygen). He, however, added that this condition could have also occurred due to the inflation of stomach due to cold weather. He told TOI that five cows were under treatment at Iglas vetenary centre but failed to confirm whether these, too, were dug out from the same spot.

Aligarh DM CB Singh strongly denied that cows were buried alive. He said that only dead cows were buried and the animals that had been taken to hospital for treatment were found sitting near that spot. He claimed that some locals were spreading rumours to vitiate the atmosphere. ""Post mortem report confirmed that they died 24-36 hours ago,"" he added.

SSP Ajay Kumar Sahni also claimed that only dead cows were buried. He said that in villages dead animals are usually buried near the canal. He claimed that some people were trying to vitiate the atmosphere in the village by digging out the dead animal from their graves.

Villagers of Iglas are up in arms against the administration for its failure to resolve the stray cattle menace. Residents say that ever since the Yogi Adityanath government imposed a ban on cow slaughter and 'cow vigilantes' are on the rampage, there has been a phenomenal increase in the population of non-lactating, old and ailing cows deserted by their owners. These animals have been destroying crops, leading to resentment among farmers.

Abhimanyu Singh, who owns 20 bigha land in Iglas area, said that the farmers can't afford to feed non-productive cows and no one wants to buy them because of the fear of ""gau rakshaks"". ""We respect cows, but they are damaging crops,"" Singh said, adding that stray cattle had become a huge nuisance. ""Farmers have been facing problems for the past one year, but now the situation has worsened. The government must take corrective measures,"" he said.

""If we block roads to pressure the administration for a solution, police register FIRs against us. What should we do, where to go?"" asks another farmer Jagdish Prasad, who owns 70 bigha land in Iglas area. He said villagers had herded hundreds of cows into government school buildings to highlight their plight.

The SSP said that five FIRs were registered so far in the Wednesday incident when animals were locked in school campuses. He told TOI that he had received information that someone had 'advised' the villagers to lock these cattle in school and health centres to earn Rs 500 per animal. He said this information was, however, yet to be verified.

The DM said that around 2,000 cattle had been shifted to 12 gaushalas in the past three days. ""We are making arrangements for cow sanctuaries in 15 available grazing land in the district where 10,000 cows would be accommodated,"" he said.

Vetenary officer Dr Varshney told TOI that there were 17 registered cow sheds in Aligarh where 3,900 cows have already been accommodated. He said a large cow shed is being developed in an area of 4.5 hectares with a capacity to accommodate 2000 cows. He said that the district administration was fully aware of the problem of stray cattle and necessary steps were being take to resolve the issue. He appealed to farmers to cooperate with administration for some more time.

Meanwhile, BSP Sadabad MLA and former minister Ramveer Upadhyaya warned the Hathras district administration that he would sit on an indefinite protest along with farmers at the DM's office if the issue of stray cattle was not resolved within a week."

The report has been titled, ""Gardening & Agriculture Equipment Market: Global Industry Analysis 2013 - 2017 and Opportunity Assessment 2018 - 2026."" Initially, the market for gardening and agriculture equipment was more focused towards manual equipment and tools in order to perform numerous tasks but with the advancement of technological landscape the market has developed and generated several opportunities for the equipment manufacturers which consists of tier-1 as well as small players operating in global and regional markets.

Request Report TOC @ www.persistencemarketresearch.com/methodology/22726

In order to retain their positions in the market, the players are entering into collaboration with the core market stakeholders in order to operate manufacturing facilities efficiently. Innovating the current technology and the optimization of new technology has become the need of the hour for the players in the market for the production of gardening and agriculture equipment. For instance, in 2017, Husqvarna Group signed an agreement to acquire the Floor Grinding Solutions Division of HTC Group AB (grinding solution). This acquisition would help company to strengthen its construction business. The players operating in the market are Honda Motor Co., Ltd, Andreas Stihl AG & Co. KG, Briggs & Stratton Corporation, Ohashi Inc., EMB MFG Inc., and Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, among others.

According to the report, the global gardening and agriculture equipment market is projected to exhibit a CAGR of 4.8% from 2018 to 2026. The market is expected to touch US$ 51,314.6 Mn by the end of 2026 rising from a valuation of US$ 33,858.2 Mn in 2017.

Rising Green Space Initiatives to Boost Demand for Gardening and Agriculture Equipment

As environmental concerns are growing and diet-related problems area increasing, governments and development partners are extensively promoting school gardening. About 12,000 schools and other educational institutions have signed up to grow school gardens. Gardening has also been added to school curriculums with an aim to promote gardening as an activity. The RHS campaign in Europe provides support and encourages institutions to promote school gardening. Institutes, such as Cambridge Primary, and Milford Pre-School, among others, have registered for school gardening campaigns and companies, such as Fisker Inc., Husqvarna Group and others, are developing gardening tools especially designed for children.

Moreover, the trend of urban green spaces is also supporting the growth of the market. Urban green spaces are those spaces in the city which are covered by vegetation or other soft and permeable surfaces. The interest in urban and green spaces seems to be rising and many cities are giving trials to innovative ways to introduce urban greenery into the cities. Cities are generating greener spaces to create more calm and environment-friendly places.

Sport turfs and Synthetic Grass to Act as Roadblock

The utilization of artificial turfs has moved rapidly beyond sports fields to commercial and residential landscaping. Use of synthetic grass and sports turfs is increasing as these require lower maintenance. Apart from that, they are also environment-friendly as they require less water. Synthetic grass and sports turfs are employed in indoor as well as outdoor residential and public gardens, play areas as well as airports as they add to the aesthetic appeal and give a natural look to the space where they are used and also have low maintenance cost. Hereafter, they are being preferred by end users over natural grass. Nevertheless, this, in turn, would lead to a decline in the growth of the gardening tools market.

The DEO after examining the bag physically, even weighed them.

The officials said that in majority of the cases, the students were found to be carrying bags heavier than what the government has prescribed. In some of the schools, the management had followed the government resolution and made changes in the time-table.

The state government had earlier issued a directive to all district education officers and district primary education officers to conduct surprise raids in schools and check the weight of schoolbags carried by children.

The education department has asked all DEOs to carry out checks in at least three schools every week irrespective of the board to which a school belongs. DEOs have been asked to check schools affiliated to Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board according to Gujarat government rules, while those affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education will be checked according to CBSE standards.

In the last week of November, after the government of India's decision, the Gujarat government had also announced that it will act against schools not following the schoolbag weight criteria and that are forcing children to carry bulky bags.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We have issued a directive to all education officers to check and prepare a list of schools flouting schoolbag norms. We will first issue notices and if the schools fail to reduce the bag weights we will penalize them. The government is working outthe penalty for such schools.""

Chudasama said no homework is to be assigned to students of classes I and II. Only half an hour of homework can be given classes III to V students and the same for Classes VII and VIII students can be one hour per day.

A district education officer said, ""It will be difficult for us to check the exact weight of the bags as we will not be carrying weighing machines. Inspectors who will be going to the schools will be using their own judgment by looking at the bags and holding it in their hands.""

He said, ""We have asked the schools to schedule their periods in such a way that the student is not required to carry all text books. According to government direction classes for only three to four subjects are to be held in a day. The notebooks for homework and classwork should not be separate. There shall be no separate notebook for essay writing."""

The Commission had received a complaint from Vanessa Peter of the Information and Resource Centre for the Deprived Urban Communities (IRCDUC), stating that the number of schools was insufficient in the colony which housed nearly 14,000 families. As on date, there is one primary school functioning out of a residential tenement, and a higher secondary school.

Many children travel long distances to their old schools. The presence of anti-social elements and the increasing crime rate have also been causes for concern and most of the families do not want to be evicted in the middle of the academic year.

During the visit, the children and their parents told Mr. Anand that they lacked toilets in these schools. They also expressed their fear to venture out in the evening due to insufficient lighting.

""To bring in all facilities it will take some time and the State has been doing it. However, steps will be taken to implement immediate necessities at the earliest,"" he said. The member will submit a report on the same to Maneka Gandhi, Minister for Women and Child Development.

Meanwhile, members of the Tamil Nadu State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (TNCPCR) also inspected the tenements and spoke to children.

""There are no toilets in the schools and they are forced to go home for the same,"" said M.P. Nirmala, Chairperson of TNCPCR.

During the interaction, they were told that the teachers were irregular to school. ""The children said that they have not been provided with school uniforms, but teachers routinely punished them for not wearing it.

""Kashmiri language is dying and we are losing our identity day by day,"" shouted protestors at Press Enclave, Srinagar. Besides raising slogans like ""Kashrin Henz Pehchan, Kashir Zaban Kashir Zaban (Identity of every Kashmiri is Kashmiri langue), the protestors asked governor administration to make this language compulsory at higher secondary level in all educational institutions.

""This is not the matter of just Kashmir students, but every Kashmiri should be worried,"" said Kifayat Ahmad, who is pursing M.A in Kashmiri from Kashmir University.

He said out of more than 200 higher secondary in the Valley, Kashmiri is taught only in 25 to 30 schools, and only nine colleges out of more than 20. ""Every year 100s of students come out from university with Post graduation in Kashmiri language.

The protestors lashed out at government for not creating jobs for Kashmiri teachers in Primary and Higher Secondary Schools and Colleges.

Pertinent to mention, Kashmiri language is being taught in all government schools of Kashmir division up to 9th standard and it is one of the optional subject for class 11th and 12th.

On Thursday, he tweeted taking exception to the plan and said he would have a discussion on the matter with Mr. Kumaraswamy. Mr. Siddaramaiah said there was a need for the State government to have clarity on Kannada language learning and Kannada medium.

Saying that he had studied in Kannada medium till high school, he asked if he was ""dimwitted"" for studying in his mother tongue. He said Kannada should remain the ""sovereign language in Karnataka"".

Govt. unclear on stand

The government currently seems to be unclear on what its stance is on introducing English medium in 1,000 schools. While the proposal was mooted by Mr. Kumaraswamy during the 2018-2019 budget session, he later retracted his statement and said English would only be taught as a language.

However, the government has not issued any directions to the Department of Public Instruction in this regard. In fact, department officials were only asked to make preparations to implement the proposal.

""Although we have started implementing other budget promises, we are still waiting for direction from the Chief Minister's Office as it is a contentious issue. We have no clarity on it,"" a senior official in the department said. While several private schools are allowed to run English-medium classes, the State government's policy does not allow sanctioning of English-medium schools in lower primary classes.

The KVS examination for the post of PGT scheduled on December 23, 2018, at Centre No. 42307 (Gyandeep English School, Lamahi, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh) had to be cancelled due to the reported wrong distribution of the PGT Test Booklets in Session I.

According to the notice released by KVS, ''Considering the future of the candidates and based on their demand made to the Officers present at the centre including the Varanasi District Administration Officer, the examination for the PGT Session I was called off.''

The notice also stated, ''The news being spread by any unscrupulous element that the Booklets of 2nd Session was distributed by the Centre is untrue and misleading.

The 'yatra', which is to start from Kurtha in Jehanabad district, is considered to be aimed at galvanizing people of his Koeri (Kushwaha) caste, which is in OBC group and accounts for six percent of the population, and also pillorying CM Nitish Kumar on the poor education scenario in the government-run schools in the state.

""For the last one and a half years, we have been campaigning for educational reforms and chalked out 25-point demands, but CM Nitish has ignored them,"" Kushwaha said.

Kushwaha, who left NDA and joined the RJD-led Grand Alliance in Bihar through Congress-led UPA last week, alleged that the BJP's national brass (read PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah) were in cahoots with CM Nitish who was bent on destroying both and his own party.

Kushwaha said his 'yatra' would cover all the districts before concluding on January 30, coinciding with the death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. Incidentally, both the Centre and the CM have announced yearlong celebrations of Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary next year.

Kushwaha said he would also lead an 'aakrosh march' to the Raj Bhavan here on February 3. He would also submit a memorandum to governor Lalji Tandon, giving details of the demands backed by signatures of 1 crore people. The RLSP rank and file would start collecting signatures on the issue from January 1.

The 'yatra' from Kurtha is symbolic as Jehanabad district has strong presence of Koeri caste population. The place is significant for Kushwaha as the Jehanabad parliamentary constituency is represented by Arun Kumar, who had won the seat on the RLSP ticket in 2014, but later turned a rebel. Recently, he condemned CM Nitish and the police lathicharge on the procession of Kushwahas in Patna. Arun's move was considered as trying to mend fences with Kushwaha.

Otherwise, Kushwaha also said the Nitish government's decision to merge two primary schools into one owing to the lack of teachers and to provide transport facility for the distantly located children to reach the newly merged school was both ""impractical and faulty""."

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

""CARE has an office and an existing water and sanitation project in schools in Serang Regency - the worst hit area,"" said Helen Vanwel, CARE Indonesia Country Director. ""We are prepared and able to assist with the delivery of hygiene kits if needed,"" She added.

Initial indications suggest at least 43 people have been killed and 584 injured, but these numbers are likely to rise as more information comes in. Power remains out across the affected areas. This latest earthquake comes three months after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami devastated the island of Sulawesi; killing over 2,000 people.

CARE is already responding to the Sulawesi disaster with emergency relief items. ""this tsunami in the Sunda Straits is the third natural disaster to affect Indonesia in the last 6 months. Aid agencies and the Government are already stretched to respond to all these different disasters. This latest tsunami shows the importance of early warning systems and good disaster preparedness mechanisms,"" says Vanwel.

CARE has worked in Indonesia since 1967, initially focused on food distribution, small infrastructure projects, health, the environment, and water and sanitation. In 2004, CARE Indonesia was one of the primary emergency responders after the South Asian tsunami.

GST refund glitches, refusal of the state to refund 42 per cent share of the Central incentives pertaining to the pre-GST period, stalemate in the land acquisition for major infrastructure development projects like four-laning of the Baddi-Nalagarh highway and rail connectivity has left the investors disappointed.

The only silver-lining is that the state gets top ranking nationally in the ease of doing business initiative in the fast-moving category. Its overall ranking has improved to 16th as against 17th attained last year. No new industrial unit has been set up due to the locational disadvantage and little has been done to break the monopoly of transport unions whose freight is among the highest in the country. The Pandoga industrial area in Una district has found no takers and little could be done to revive the case of seeking environmental clearance of 515 bigha land at Dhabota in Nalagarh where new industrial area is proposed.

The much-awaited bulk drug park, announced by the Union Chemical and Fertilisers Minister in April 2016, is yet to receive funds for developing the 663.11 bigha site at Aduwal village in Nalagarh. Efforts to set up a cement plant at Churah subdivision of Chamba district have failed to yield results. The government has again announced an investor meet, albeit with a difference, where the Chief Minister is slated to lead a host of senior officials within the country and abroad to attract investment.

The Mukhya Mantri Swavlamban Yojana, which fetches 25 per cent investment subsidy with a ceiling of Rs 40 lakh in plant and machinery and an interest subsidy of 5 per cent for three years, was introduced in May to promote employment. As many as 793 proposals were forwarded to the banks but barely 36 were sanctioned and funds worth Rs 7.88 crore were disbursed which speak volumes about its lack of popularity. Limited success is received under the ambitious 'Start-Up Himachal' scheme with barely 40 start-ups having received financial assistance.

The state was,however, rated as ""Hill State leader and an aspiring leader in developing an enabling start-up ecosystem"" nationally. The 5-year Central Capital Investment Incentive for access to credit at 30 per cent for plant and machinery announced for the micro, small and medium enterprises is the lone new Central scheme which brought some cheer to the existing units.

Students without uniform, scholarship

It was a challenging year for the government in the education sector as it grappled with downtrend in enrollment and filling of vacancies while facing stiff resistance from teacher unions in its bid to bring qualitative improvement in education.

The scholarship scam of Rs 250 crore was unearthed in the Education Department and preliminary investigations revealed that the tentacles of the scam spread to other states also. The government has now handed over the investigations to the CBI. The department remained under the scanner of the High Court which monitored the measures taken by government to fill vacant posts.

The regularisation of teacher has not been done since 2008 and resentment was brewing among teachers as a large number of teachers retired without getting promotion. The government closed 100 elementary schools with less than 10 students and proposed the merger or closure of more than 400 elementary schools.

Efforts were made to get the best from teachers as annual increment of 38 PGTs were stopped for less than 25 per cent results in Class XII board examinations. To arrest the flight of students to private schools, the government introduced pre-primary (Nursery) classes in 3,391 schools on a pilot basis from the coming session and so far, 30,000 students have been registered. The enrollment in government schools has dropped by 23.7 per cent in past 10 years.

Under pressure from student unions, the government took a retrograde step to revert to annual system from semester system under RUSA while the cluster university, which was set up at Mandi, is yet to be functional.

The government failed to provide free uniforms to students of government schools from Class I to Class XII under the Atal Vardi Yojana.

The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti.

Even as there was marginal increase in revenue from power to Rs 1,100 crore as compared to Rs 950 crore last year, yet the state failed to add even a single megawatt to its existing capacity. The government tried to lure power producers by offering sops like deferring 12 free power royalty and other measures. Yet the exit of power producers continued as there was no takers for most of the projects in the Chandra basin in Lahaul-Spiti. There was complete lack of interest in the 1000 MW solar energy projects in Spiti as the HP State Transmission Corporation failed to lay the transmission line to evacuate power from the region.

The Directorate of Energy allotted just two projects - the jinxed 780 MW Jangi Thopan to the SJVNL and the 447 MW Dugar in 2018.

No effort was made to store over rain water in the monsoon on the Giri, Dharampur khud, both tributaries of the Yamuna, that goes waste every year as Shimla and Solan continue to face water shortage.

Private power producers cited high cost of power generation and lack of infrastructure like roads and transmission lines as the main reasons for not showing interest in the projects.The existing power companies had to resort to shutdown of powerhouses owing to the high level of silt. As a result, power companies and state suffered losses due to the frequent shutdown, while the consumers faced power cuts and water problems for hours during the shutdown.

Caught in debt trap

With the debt mounting to almost Rs 50,000 crore, the poor financial health of the state remained the biggest challenge before the BJP regime in its first year in office.

The absence of major revenue generation and limited Central funding under various schemes prevented the Jai Ram government from undertaking any major schemes. Most big projects and schemes are being implemented through Central funding.

Even as the Congress cried hoarse about the poor fiscal management, the BJP regime raised loans to the tune of Rs 2,500 crore against a limit of Rs 7,600 crore. The salary component of almost 2 lakh government employees is Rs 11,000 crore while the pensionary burden is to the tune of Rs 6,000 crore annually. A sum of Rs 4,300 crore will have to be paid as interest on loans during the financial year 2018-19.

The biggest area of concern is the extra spending on recruitment, besides upgrade and opening of new health and educational institutions. The only silver-lining is the hike in revenue from the power sector from Rs 750 crore in 2017-18 to Rs 10,500 crore.

The biggest challenge before the CM, who holds the Finance Department, is generating resources for which the government is eying power, tourism, industry and mining."

Having played up Mahatma Gandhi's message on prohibition often as symbolism to shore up support for the anti-liquor law in the state, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has now instructed government officials to prominently display the Mahatma's message on ""seven social sins"" on government buildings across the state. Nearly 1.6 lakh government buildings are learnt to have been identified across the state for this exercise.

Opposition RJD said although spreading the Mahatma's message is welcome, there is ""no justification for spending crores on writing those messages"", and that the work can be done by students and volunteers.

In a circular issued by Principal Secretary, General Administration Department, Amir Subhani on December 20, all principal secretaries, department heads, DGPs, commissioners and district magistrates were asked to ensure that Gandhi's ""seven sins"" are written on government building walls. The circular states, ""Mahatma Gandhi's thoughts are very relevant in context of state's inclusive development and good governance.""

Subhani identified two messages for being particularly relevant for public servants and citizens. The first message says, ""Whatever we get from this earth is enough to fulfil our basic needs, but it is not enough to satiate our greed.""

The second message, which has been identified to be put up on walls of government buildings, are the ""seven social sins"": siddhant ke bina rajniti (politics without principles), kaam ke bina dhan (wealth without work), vivek ke bina sukh (pleasure without conscience), charitra ke bina hyan (knowledge without character), naitikta ke bina vyapar (commerce without morality), manavta ke bina vigynan (science without humanity), and tyaag ke bina puja (worship without sacrifice).

Advertising

Nitish has been talking about spreading Gandhi's message ever since the state celebrated the Champaran satyagrah's centenary celebrations in April 2017. He has also suggested schools to recount a short story from Gandhi's life after daily prayers.

Although the government has not set any deadline, the work on writing Gandhi's ""seven sins"" on walls of government buildings is likely to be completed within two months, according to officials.

Nalanda District Magistrate Thiyagarajan S M told The Indian Express: ""It (the work) has been started. It will be done for close to 5,500 buildings (in the district). These include schools, anganwadi centres, primary health centres (PHCs), APHCs, sub-centres and other government buildings by the end of this month.""

A senior government official at the state headquarters said, ""We have identified about 200 buildings in Patna itself. By rough calculation, over 1.6 lakh state government buildings, including schools and primary healthcare centres, have been identified across Bihar's 38 districts.""

Most districts are getting the messages printed on flax sheet and putting them up on walls. RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tewary said: ""Although there is nothing wrong in spreading Gandhi's messages, but there is no justification for spending crores on writing those messages. It should have been done by students and volunteers.... As for Nitish playing up Gandhi symbolism, I want to ask whether there was no Gandhi or Gandhism when Nitish Kumar had taken liquor shops to villages for 11 years, and when he banned liquor, Gandhi became a mascot for him.... Writing Gandhi's message on walls is another gimmick."""

Even as Pune gears up to host the second Khelo India Games in 12 days, it has emerged that more than half of the athletes handpicked from the inaugural edition haven't joined the government's flagship programme.

Out of the 1,518 under-17 athletes selected by a high-powered committee, only 625 have joined the training camps at 89 academies identified by the sports ministry. The primary reason for the remaining 893 athletes giving these camps a miss was their reluctance to leave their schools in the middle of the academic year.

""625 out of the total number of Khelo India talent have joined academies in 2018, while the others have not yet joined because Khelo India talent is selected through the year, and it is not possible for all the players to change their schools in the middle of the academic year to join an academy,"" informed SAI director general Neelam Kapoor.

While the first edition of the Games ended in early February, the government released the first list of athletes only in July after conducting dope tests and age verification. The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) said in March that 12 medal winners from the Games had tested positive. Many more were weeded out because they were found to be overage. The final list was released in December after fresh names of talented athletes were added to those who made the cut during the Khelo India event. This delay was responsible for many athletes not opting to join the training camps.

Advertising

Kapoor said that this year, they would finalise the list by February, ""so that the players can join the accredited academies in the start of the academic year and balance their sporting career as well as education.""

Under the Khelo India programme launched last year, the government planned to identify and train athletes and provide them an annual assistance of up to Rs 5 lakh each for eight years. According to officials involved in the project, the confusion over financial remuneration also led to several pullouts.

A trainee, who decided not to join the programme, said his coaches and parents believed he receive Rs 5 lakh annually under the scheme. But after the government announced that the actual stipend would be Rs 10,000 per month (Rs. 1,20,000 annual), he had second thoughts. Kapoor said the grant of Rs 5 lakh per year included costs incurred for ""training, kitting, equipment, fooding and lodging in an accredited academy, and an out-of-pocket expense for each scholar at Rs 10,000 per month.""

Another reason why several trainees decided not to join the programme was the fact that they would've to leave their existing academy and coaches, and relocate to the centre assigned to her/him. According to the terms laid down by the government, athletes did not have the option to continue training at their original academy and avail the benefits of the scheme.

For the second edition, the government has merged school and college level categories for a combined Khelo India Youth Games. It will be held in Pune from January 9 to 20."
"138","1027009632","2018-12-26","http://www.asianage.com/life/more-features/261218/living-the-indian-dream.html","Living the Indian dream","The Asian Age",FALSE,"Subramanian, who is fondly known as Subbu among colleagues and friends, was the first one to go to college in his family.

Leadership trainer, entrepreneur and author Farshad Asl refers to the American Dream in his best-seller 'The ""No Excuses"" Mindset' when he says, ""we live in the land of opportunities. People come from all over the world to hustle and work their way up to places that they could only imagine or dream of"".

Many have left the Indian shores as well in search of this American Dream and it is time for them to come back. Freedom to dream big and opportunities to achieve them are no less in their own land. Krishnamurthy Subramanian, the newly appointed Chief Economic Advisor of the country will readily agree to this as his journey is one from an 'extremely humble background"" to the coveted office for any economist in the country, that too at a relatively young age of 47.

His father A V Krishnamurthy sold 'papads' (appalam in the local language) on the streets of Tambaram on the outskirts of Chennai to make both ends meet and complete schooling. The senior Krishnamurthy had to leave his hometown in Tiruchirappalli for Chennai after he lost his father at a young age of seven. He did odd jobs and somehow completed schooling. He got a job in Indian Railways but remained in the lower grades for a long time.

Subramanian, who is fondly known as Subbu among colleagues and friends, was the first one to go to college in his family. His father knew the importance of education and wanted the children to have what he was denied due to financial constraints. Subramanian thankfully acknowledges the role played by his father in making him what he is today. His mother, a homemaker, too is a Tamilian, who has her roots in Kerala.

Subramanian and his younger brother Vaidyanathan spent their school days in Bilaspur, now in Chattisgarh. During the Bilaspur days he cultivated a liking for Bollywood flicks and songs. It is interesting to see the other side of an economist, who is a fan of Amitabh Bachchan, who delights in movies like 3 Idiots and loves to hear Kishore Kumar's Jeevan Se Bhari Teri Aankhen from the movie Safar. As most of the children of 80's he too developed a craze for cricket, which declined to die out even during the days of academic rigour.

Being good at mathematics, he gained entry to the prestigious IIT Kanpur, graduating in electrical engineering. He worked with Tata Consultancy Services for three years under a bond after completing graduation. By then, he started to realise that he was not meant to be an engineer. With his passion for mathematics, finance felt like a natural extension. He did his MBA in finance from IIM-Calcutta, where he was named to the Honour Roll of the Institute for being a top ranker in the batch and was awarded the Institute's coveted medal for the most balanced outlook to business problems.

For the next two years, Subramanian worked with ICICI with their derivatives research team. Wanting to go deeper into financial economics, he applied for Ph.D and going by the advice of his mentor and banker Nachiket Mor and former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, he chose University of Chicago Booth School of Business, which is known for its free market economics. It was the time when behavioural economics and other schools of economic thoughts were gaining traction. His guide Luigi Zingales and Raghuram Rajan had together penned 'Saving Capitalism from Capitalists' around that time. An influence of these thoughts have reflected in the banking reform recommendations made in 2014 by the P J Nayak committee, of which Subramanian was a member.

After completing Ph.D, Subramanian served as finance faculty at Goizueta Business School at Emory University in the United States till 2010. By then, he had decided to come back and contribute to the economic growth of his home country. By 2012, his guide Raghuram Rajan also had taken up the prestigious responsibility of heading the Reserve Bank of India.

In 2010, Subramanian joined Indian School of Business in Hyderabad and currently serves as Associate Professor of Finance (with tenure) and Executive Director for the Centre for Analytical Finance. Subramanian's wife Kavita also serves the ISB as its head of Academic Services Administration and Senior Associate Director in Hyderabad. Interestingly, Subramanian's younger brother Krishnamurthy Vaidyanathan is also associated with the ISB.

He is a faculty member in its Mohali campus. He too is a graduate from IIT Kanpur, alumnus of IIM Ahmedabad and has done Ph.D in Finance from Edhec Business School in Paris.

Subramanian also serves as a member of SEBI's Standing Committees on Alternative Investment Policy, Primary Markets, Secondary Markets and Research. He was part of the Uday Kotak Panel, which has made recommendations on corporate governance. He is also on the boards of Bandhan Bank, the National Institute of Bank Management, and the RBI Academy and was also part of the P.J. Nayak Committee, which reviewed the governance of boards of banks in India. He has also done a research in bankruptcy code.

The Chief Economic Advisor technically has to play a key role in shaping the economic policies that guide the government initiatives. Subramanian is an apt choice as Chief Economic Advisor at a time when the banking system is beleaguered by huge non-performing assets and loan defaulting corporate sector continues to be an unresolved puzzle. The timing is crucial as the National Democratic Alliance, hit by the recent losses in the state assembly elections, will need an ""Economic Survey boost"" before going for the Lok Sabha polls next year.

As CEA, the first task for Subramanian would be coming out with a survey that will define the policies of the government aspiring for another term. The task will become even more arduous if the survey has to outline solutions for the vexing problems of the economy while appearing populist. Subramanian believes in expansion of formal economy through taxation and taxing of farmers. After the recent poll results which reflected the discontent among agrarian community and the informal sector, Subramanian may have to keep aside some of his economic theories and get to work on a more populist survey. More than long-term policies, the government would now prefer quick fix solutions.

Subramanian also holds strong opinion in a variety of subjects which sometimes seem radical for a vote-dependent political class. As an independent economist, Subramanian has been quite vocal about the economic and political developments in the country. But diplomacy and restraint are two virtues that come handy when one becomes part of the administrative system, especially when the independence and autonomy of governmental institutions are at stake.

He had expressed his optimism about the state of affairs at a time when Arvind Panagariya was Vice-Chairman of Niti Aayog, Arvind Subramanian the CEA and Raghuram Rajan the RBI Governor. All of them have gone and even the successor of Rajan has quit. An advocate of providing more autonomy for public sector banks and a critic of state interference in the banking system, Subramanian will have a tougher time ahead.

He was among the very few economists who had welcomed demonetisation after the government withdrew the high value notes. While his views drew a lot of flak, he has also openly praised Raghuram Rajan and Arvind Subramanian, who at different points of time, disapproved the government's misadventure. His articles linking subsidies and dynasty rule and dissection of crime data of Uttar Pradesh also drew the attention of readers, especially those who are critical of the current political dispensation at the centre and the state."

Later, the schools were closed by the administration and the children went back to their homes. FIRs were being registered till the time of filing of this report.

Angered by stray cattle roaming around in their villages and damaging crops, residents of Mohakampur in Iglas, Kaser Gangiri in Atrauli and a few other blocks of the district locked up around 800 animals in schools. Protests against the stray cattle menace have been happening in Aligarh for the past three days. Stray animals were even locked up inside a primary health centre.

Sonia Verma, a teacher in one of the primary schools which was closed said, ""We are facing a lot of problems as classes are being disrupted and students are feeling insecure due to the prevailing atmosphere. The school compound has also become dirty. We don't know when this issue will be resolved, but we have informed our seniors.""

An emergency meeting was called by district magistrate CB Singh, which was attended by police officers, pradhans of the villages and the education officer. The DM directed pradhans to control the situation and prevent residents from resorting to such measures. ""These incidents are unusual and seem to be politically motivated. FIRs will be lodged against people responsible for this,"" Singh added.

Following the meeting, basic shiksha adhikari (BSA) Dr Laxmikant Pandey issued a letter to all block education officers (BEO) and asked them to direct teachers of primary and upper primary schools to make video clippings of those people who herded stray cows into schools and provide the clippings to the police station concerned with a complaint.

Senior superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Sahini told TOI that people responsible for such an act would be booked under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act."

But an officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the militants had overrun an army base, and put the death toll at 18.

An army statement said the attackers ambushed a military convoy late Monday on a highway linking Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, with Damaturu in neighbouring Yobe state.

""Sadly, 13 military and a police personnel... paid the supreme price while extricating themselves from the ambush,"" said the statement, signed by local military spokesman Colonel Onyema Nwachukwu.

The attack followed an attempted raid on a nearby military base along the highway in Kukareta village, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from Damaturu, Nwachukwu said.

That attack was ""repelled"" by troops who ""engaged and overpowered the terrorists, killing several of them"", Nwachukwu said, adding that a soldier was injured.

Other security sources said fighters travelling in eight trucks fitted with anti-aircraft guns had overrun the base.

""The terrorists killed 17 soldiers in the attack, which lasted for more than an hour,"" an officer told AFP on condition of anonymity.

""They took over the military base after overpowering troops and burnt it down. A policeman was killed when their vehicle which was heading to Damaturu ran into crossfire but the driver escaped unhurt,"" the military source said.

A civilian militiaman in the area gave a similar account and said the fighters withdrew after torching the base.

""They burnt the base and two military vehicles. They also burnt two primary schools in Kukareta and neighbouring Ngaurawa village,"" said the militiaman.

Boko Haram jihadists have carried out dozens of attacks on military bases in recent months. Scores of soldiers have been killed or listed as missing.

The 120-kilometre (75-mile) Maiduguri-Damaturu highway has seen repeated attacks, including raids on military bases and markets.

In September 2013, Boko Haram fighters disguised as soldiers barricaded the highway and killed 167 people, in the worst attack targeting motorists.

The nine-year-long insurgency has killed 27,000 people and displaced two million more, creating a dire humanitarian crisis.

The conflict has spilled over into Nigeria's northern neighbours Chad, Niger and Cameroon.

India's youths seem to have taken Mahatma Gandhi's advice - be the change you want to see - to heart. Through 2018, the one common theme that stood out in the stories that grabbed eyeballs and created an impact with our readers was young change-makers.

Be it through ideas, startups, innovations, individual campaigns and initiatives, community engagement, or voluntary services, numerous youngsters chose to focus on solutions rather than problems.

From unique innovations, ideas and solutions to help in household chores to using peer-to-peer learning model in schools and taking cancer screening medical camps to rural India, the nation's youth are becoming harbingers of change. We list a few stories that inspired us this year and will continue to provide inspiration in the New Year.

No point crying over spilt milk, but there could be some when spilt juice is involved. To avoid getting an earful from his mother over some juice he spilled, 10-year-old Arman Gupta invented the ""Mopping Machine"", a remote-controlled cleaning device for wet surfaces.

With detachable sponges, the machine can be customised for different surfaces -- the floor, under the table, and corners. The Class 5 student become the youngest innovator to showcase his creation at Somaiya Research Innovation Incubation Design Laboratory (RIIDL's) 'Maker Mela' in January this year.

India will have the world's largest rural population by 2050, and Dr Priyanjali Datta's Aaroogya is democratising preventive healthcare to combat breast cancer to the last mile. The team identifies a ""vulnerable location"" and chooses a village based on availability and access to primary healthcare facilities.

Priyanjali's team comprises doctors and volunteers who go door to door and visit every family in a village. They speak to women about the disease, teach them breast self-examination, and also clinically examine them. The bootstrapped organisation has helped 500,000 women across Delhi-NCR region, Haryana, and North Eastern states, including West Bengal.

Mohd Sujathullah, a student at Sultan Ul Uloom College of Pharmacy, distributes free food to 1,000 people every day outside Koti Maternity Hospital and Nilofer Children's Hospital, Hyderabad. Sujathullah wakes up early and leaves his house at around 7.30 am every morning for Koti Maternity Hospital where 300 poor patients have already queued up and are waiting for a meal.

Within 15 minutes, he, along with a volunteer or two, finishes distributing hot upma to them and proceeds to his next destination. At Nilofer Children's Hospital, another 700 people on an average are waiting to get their breakfast. For 485 days now, this routine has become a part of his daily schedule. Irrespective of bad weather, poor health, or other reasons, he does not fail to show up at both locations every morning.

Rohim Momin, an orphan, school dropout, and the sole breadwinner of his family, migrated to Delhi from his village in Malda, West Bengal, and joined the construction labour force. His determination to earn a better livelihood and secure his three younger sisters' future drove him to go beyond manual labour.

He sought to get skill training and refine his bricklaying capabilities and went on to represent India at the World Skills Competition in Abu Dhabi. Rohim went on to win a 'Medallion of Excellence,' and the fifth position. Through his work and training, Rohim hopes to spread the message that laborious work can help propel the country's economy forward.

In today's fast-paced, highly digitalised world, some humane ideas have ensured that stray animals - often found hurting, homeless, and overlooked - are not left behind. Let It Wag is an app that connects animal lovers and caregivers across India so that strays get the medical attention they need in real time.

""Let it Wag is like 911 for animals. The whole idea is to get all stakeholders on one platform, and simplify and improve the turnaround time for rescuing animals,"" says Yash Sheth, the 27-year-old Founder of this mobile application.

Within 100 days of its launch, Yash has started seeing the change he envisioned. With over 4,000-plus users on their Android app and through volunteers, the team has helped 215 dogs, 15 cats, 3 owls, and 12 pigeons in trouble. Two puppies have been adopted, Yash says.

Founded by 24-year-old social entrepreneur Abhishek Dubey, Muskaan Dreams is a unique education initiative that is currently operating in three cities of Madhya Pradesh - Gwalior, Bhopal, and Indore. The startup tries to solve the problem of insufficient teachers in rural government schools through e-learning (self-learning) classrooms for students.

The virtual classrooms allow students to easily learn anything related to their subjects. The social startup uses LED screens in order to ensure sustainability. Abhishek began teaching and mentoring 70 children on weekends in the orphanages of Gwalior with 20 volunteers before he founded Muskaan Dream Creative Foundation. In the last four years, Muskaan Dreams has reached out to over 5,000 students in rural India through different initiatives."

The Report of the Expert Panel was delivered to Prime Minister Turnbull on 18 May, 2018 following a two month consultation period. Upon receipt of the Report, Prime Minister Turnbull commented: ""I look forward to considering the report in detail and will consult with members of the Government before releasing it to the public and responding to its findings.""

On 12 October 2018 Fairfax Media leaked the Report.

The Government released the Report, and it's response, on 13 December 2018.

The Fairfax Media report contained 20 recommendations, however, the recommendations that garnered the most media coverage and sparked the fiercest debate are recommendations 5 and 7.

These recommendations suggest the amendment of Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) to allow religious schools to, respectively, ""discriminate in relation to the employment of staff, and the engagement of contractors"" and ""in relation to a student basis of sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"". However, the recommendation provides that ""the discrimination is grounded in the precepts of the religion"" and that the school policy on the issue is made publically available, provided to current and prospective employees contractors, and students. Recommendation 7, which relates to discrimination in relation to student, also states that the discrimination may take place provided that ""The school has regard to the best interests of the child as the primary consideration in its conduct.""

Academics Liam Elphick, Amy Maguire and Anja Hilkemeijer have commented that ""Much of the immediate reaction to the leaks incorrectly claimed that the recommendations would grant such a right for the first time"", which is not the case.

Currently, section 38 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 (Cth) permits educational institutions established for religious purposes to ""discriminate against another person on the ground of the other person's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or relationship status or pregnancy in connection with..."":

However, for the discrimination to be lawful, the education institution must ""discriminate in good faith in order to avoid injury to the religious susceptibilities of adherents of that religion or creed.""

Elphick, Maguire and Hilkemeijer have explained that the additional limitations contained in recommendations 5 and 7 would actually ""constrain this existing right to discriminate"".

While the right of faith-based schools to discriminate on the basis of ""sexual orientation, gender identity or relationship status"" has been enshrined in legislation for some time, the release of the recommendations by Fairfax seems to made many more people aware of the fact, and sparked debate on the legitimacy of such an anti-discrimination exemption.

The exemptions ""that enabled faith-based schools to discriminate against teachers, contractors students and so forth"" were actually introduced in 2013 by the Gillard Labor Government. The current Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has voiced support for repealing the existing exemptions, stating: ""It's time our laws reflected the values we teach our children."" The Liberal Party, on the other hand, appear to be "" split"" on their stance to the current exemptions.

In an address given following the publication of the recommendations, the Anglican Archbishop of Sydney, Dr Glenn Davies, argued for the right of ""religious organisations... to operate according to their religious ethos"", explaining that he believed that ""Anglican schools, if they are going to remain Anglican, must be able to employ staff who support the Christian values of the school"". However, he stated: ""Let's be very clear. Anglican schools in Sydney do not expel students for being gay.""

While the Expert Panel's Report, and the Government's response, were not released until 13 December 2018, in the final sitting days of Parliament in early December, the Government tabled proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act that, in its view, ""would have removed discrimination against students while also protecting religious schools' ability to maintain their ethos"". However, the proposed amendments did not have the support of the Opposition, and no new legislation was enacted.

In its official reply to the Report, the Government responded to recommendations 5 and 7 as follows:

While noting and agreeing with the principle underpinning the... recommendations ..., the government is of the view that further consideration is necessary to address the complexities associated with these recommendations.

In particular, the Government:

will consult with the States and Territories on the terms of a potential reference to the ALRC [Australian Law Reform Commission] to consider [the] recommendations 1 and 5 to 8 of the Review with a view to settling upon a legislative mechanism that would, on a nationally consistent basis, achieve the twin purposes of limiting or removing altogether (if practicable) legislative exemptions to prohibitions on discrimination based on a person's identity, while also protecting the right of religious institutions to reasonably conduct themselves in a way consistent with their religious ethos.

We will keep you abreast of future developments in this area, and in particular any proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act flowing from the Report."

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

IoT in education market - Overview

Rise in the use of mobile and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled devices has transformed several industries, including automotive, health care, and retail. However, one of the significant beneficiaries of Internet of Things (IoT) is the education sector. Smart devices have become commonplace in classrooms. Each year, Internet-enabled devices, such as smart boards to tablets, are being introduced in classrooms. IoT-enabled devices provide a number of benefits to educational institutions, which help them function in a more efficient manner. The most important benefit of having a connected classroom is that it streamlines tracking and accountability. Moreover, the cloud allows for easy storage of data related to students' grades, classwork and homework, and various assignments. In case of higher education, IoT has made gathering, sharing, and presentation of information easy and quick. Colleges and universities are experimenting with IoT approaches. For instance, adoption of fitness devices to keep check on students' health or tracking temperature readings in lab equipment and sending notifications whenever required.

IoT in education market - Drivers and Restraints

IoT in education creates an entire learning flow, from content creation to publication of large online modules. It also helps in the deployment of an academic LMS in educational institutions that essentially allows instructors to manage course content and monitor and evaluate students' performance. A lecture capture solution (LCS) is another interactive platform used in educational institutions that records lessons, presentations, and meetings in the digital format for later viewing.

The IoT in education market is driven by the production of digital learning solutions supported by strong connectivity, low-cost devices, and strong government initiatives in different regions to promote the adoption of IoT enabled devices in schools and universities. Digital learning solutions efficiently integrate with one another to allow data to flow seamlessly, thereby allowing institutions to build a comprehensive Big Data repository. Increase in the requirement of students to receive information anytime and anywhere and the need to propagate information have brought IoT enabled solutions to the vanguard of the education sector.

However, the growing vulnerability around the security and privacy of the IoT ecosystem and complications regarding financing information technology infrastructure and services are estimated to restrict the growth of the IoT in education market in the coming years. Nevertheless, increase in the adoption of IoT devices is expected to present a number of opportunities for IoT in education market. Many universities are now using hybrid cloud as their enterprise architecture for hosting different IoT applications. Moreover, there is rise in the use of learning management systems for generating vast data among schools as well as universities. Advance electronic classrooms are now well equipped with lecture capture systems and web streaming that provide material on demand whenever required. IoT also offers a unique opportunity for online digital courses, which helps students to attend courses without being physically present. This has helped students in emerging economies to earn degrees without investing large amounts in higher education. IoT is being used to integrate mobile learning applications. The apps are helping students to take advantage for learning resources, efficiently work on projects, and manage assignments.

' '

A $15.5 billion market in the US, the youth sports market rivals the size of the $14 billion NFL. Youth sports markets are comprised of segments that represent revenue generation from travel, equipment, team membership, facility construction, software, and venue rental. Leagues who purchase and distribute sports software to teams or clubs have created a large market from what were previously disparate parts of what was not ever not even a market, just people buying clothes and equipment, and loosely organized groups of youth playing games on community fields.

As a result of this coalescence of the varying market segments brought about by youth sports software, the youth sports market has become well defined. Apps are used for communication. The primary purpose of youth and adult sports team sports is to deliver fun for the youth. Other agendas get mixed in, like building a strong and healthy body, developing a well-rounded and pleasant personality, developing team skills, and preparing a child to be a professional athlete. Youth sports depend on communication, tournament play, and video coaching that are needed to run a team effectively. Transaction management, registration, and fee collection are key aspects of some of the software.

Youth sports facilities can become part of a community development program. Every team, every sport has appeal and as there is more leisure, as the economy spins out more and more wealth at the top of the economic scale, there will be more spending on sports. Professional sports, betting, fantasy teams, semiprofessional teams, and teams just for fun will continue to look for venues and players.

Youth sports are sure to benefit from this trend. The brightest and the best will want to get top notch sports training for their children, and the entire middle class will follow as best they can. Sports are fun, the professional teams have begun to recognize that they need to invest in team development programs targeting children starting at age 3. This is when you can get the attention of the child and build skills incrementally that are providing a steady stream of youth available later for the professional teams.

Professional teams have noticed that the most ardent fans are those who played a sport as a youth. All the professional leagues have to invest in youth sports because otherwise they do not have players now and fans later.

Foundations and corporate arms of all large companies want to invest in supporting youth of the country and what better way than through sports. They can tie educational advancement of the sport interest.

Communities have to invest in youth sports providing activities that are supervised and better for all the residents, sports and teams have greater society benefits than the enjoyment of team play. Communities have found that it is cheaper to invest in planned sporting activities and keep children involved than to deal with the problems caused by kids that grow up without supervision, getting in trouble all the time.

The police departments have become interested in connecting with youth in a positive manner, spending money and time to get to know kids and provide guidance when needed. They are active in getting communities to fund development of facilities. It will be a problem to pay for all the facilities that communities want to build, so it will be interesting to see if communities find ways to contribute to the capital investment needed.

Private investment that sees benefit youth sporting programs is building in quantity. Foundations generally see the benefit of children being given sport opportunities.

The schools have by and large defunded gym programs for children creating a healthcare crisis of major proportion in the US and other parts of the world with childhood obesity and asthma creating lifelong chronic disease problems. The good news is that youth sports programs are becoming more available in more affluent parts of the world, poised to deliver healthy activity and build life long habits of movement and athletic skills development.

The market opportunity for youth team sports depends on a strong alliance between the schools and modern recreational facilities that meld education, drama, music and sports in a manner that supports learning and athletic development as one melded event.

With the advent of online learning, more students can move at their own pace and achieve academic excellence. One challenge is to make this happen in the context of incorporating sports achievement at the same time. Athleticism and brain development can be melded if education is done right.

Six in 10 children ages 6-12 regularly participate in team sports in the US. These sports programs are organized or casual.

With organized sports, there has been a rise in the number of travel teams, with the programs active at ever-earlier ages. There has been significant definition and growth in the youth sports industry. The coaching and league formation task is demanding for kids, families, and communities. Much of the organizational process has been automated with software.

The youth sports market is set to grow in response to increased interest worldwide in youth sports development programs. The programs are inherently satisfying to children and youth, giving them skills and accompanying self-esteem that translates to support academic skills as well as athletic ones. Software has become an important aspect of making team play easy to manage.

More changes are coming as digitization drives use of video so parents and children can share on the Internet the experience of team play. Video capture of game and practice play is poised to provide coaches and assistant coaches with an ever-increasing array of ways to help players improve play on the field.

Little league coaches bring a lot to the children whom they coach. The individual attention to skills development is a treasure to each child it touches. Stories proliferate about the value of little league coaches to girls and boys who had a dad or mom missing at crucial times of growing up. The same is true for the Girl's and Boy's clubs.

In these cases, a substitute parent is an invaluable part of forming a strong personality, able to be responsive to others, fit into a team, and perform with integrity. The coaches teach values in a context of fun.

The youth sports software is sold or given away free to teams, leagues and tournaments. Often a league will distribute the software to teams, clubs, or tournaments. Sometimes teams and clubs buy the software directly. A lot of youth sports software had been homegrown functionality bolted onto a stable platform. This homegrown small market software has basically become outdated, slated to be replaced with packaged, licensed or cloud software that is more robust.

The youth sports software provides registration and payment collection. The payment collection aspect of the software is sometimes important because it creates a way to collect a transaction fee that is used to pay for the software and provide continuing revenue to the provider.

The primary purpose of youth and adult sports team software is to deliver robust, automated process for the registration, scheduling, web site construction, coaching management, communication, tournament play, and video coaching that are needed to run a team effectively. Transaction management and fee collection are key aspects of some of the software.

According to Susan Eustis, leader of the market research team that prepared the study for WinterGreen Research, ""Vendors are making acquisitions to upgrade software so it is able to provide a wide range of capabilities. Modules brought in from different companies and developers are difficult to integrate into a functioning platform. Once a platform is in place, the organization of travel teams is facilitated.""

Market growth comes from increased benefits of organization in youth sports leagues. Travel teams and tournaments are in vogue. These do not happen in a consistent manner unless there is automated process in place. Automated process is just better for making a team function smoothly, eliminating vast amounts of politics. Shared resource is always a problem, having automated management is better. Once one aspect of the team management is automated, there is demand to automate all the processes across the board leading to plenty of consolidation and acquisitions in this market.

In a $15.5 billion U.S. youth sports market, the youth and amateur adult league travel teams are gaining traction because they provide family vacation fun while improving skills of a youthful player. This is a nascent market, there is no end to growth in sight. Markets are expected to reach $41.2 billion by 2023. Youth sports teams will continue to get more organized and depend on software to provide increased management efficiency. Video images of play will provide better coaching.

As many as 13 schools have recorded zero enrolment, while another 171 schools have fewer than 20 students. A total of 1,140 schools have fewer than 40 students.

These were the details furnished by the state in 2017-18 to the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database about schools in India, developed at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA). According to officials, the reason for the low enrolment is parents' preference to private schools due to lack of infrastructure, teacher absenteeism, and poor quality education in government schools, among others.

This is in addition to 1,773 schools without buildings, which the government plans to merge with nearby schools with infrastructure. The merger plan comes after the state failed to land for the 1,773 schools. Most of these schools have been merged. Of them, 190 schools in Patna district alone.

The enrolment in government schools dropped to 1.8 crore in 2017-18 from 1.99 crore in 2016-17. The number is expected to drop further when fresh data is examined, diluting the government claim of more than 99% enrolment.

The most alarming trend reflected through U-DISE is that the dropout rate from Class 9 to Class 10- almost 25% of the total enrollment in 2014-15, which jumped to 39.73% in 2016-17, the period when there was unprecedented increase in the number of students failing in Bihar class 10 and 12 board exams.

One of the reasons for the drop, authorities admitted, is parents' preference for private schools for better education and infrastructure.

""If the incentives (such as scholarships, bicycles) attached with government schools are removed, the number will drop further. Many students get admitted to government schools to avail incentives but study in private schools. In 2011, when reports on inflated enrolments surfaced, it created a flutter,"" an education department official added.

Three years ago, the then principal secretary, department of education, Amarjeet Sinha, had said the duplication of enrolment in government schools could be up to 20%.

Bihar Education Project Council (BSEPC) director Sanjay Singh, however, said that the drop in students' number was due to government's drive to do away with duplication in enrolment. ""The number children availing mid-day meal has come down to 1.20 crore compare to previous years,"" he added.

Singh said that the sanctity of data was being maintained. ""Earlier, there was no data on private schools. Now, that is also being prepared. Around 12 lakh more students have joined private schools, not necessarily because they have suddenly opened, but because they are being documented,"" he added.

Singh said under the Right to Education Act, there should be a school within a kilometre for Class 1-5 students provided there are a minimum of 40 students. ""If that is not the case, teachers can be used elsewhere more effectively. Having 3-4 teachers for fewer than 40 children is not relevant,"" he said, adding he would do another appraisal in January after studying the reasons and reports of physical verification."

A study conducted by the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA) and Child Rights and You (CRY) has raised questions over the government schools being run in six states.

The study claims that just the two states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, have a vacancy of over 4.2 lakh teaching positions, reports The Indian Express.

Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal were part of the study.

Overall, the study revealed that there is a shortage of five lakh elementary school teachers in these states, while 14 per cent of government secondary schools do not meet the mandatory minimum number of six teachers.

Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra were the best performers in filling up teaching posts, recruiting about 95 per cent of the sanctioned strength at their elementary schools.

On the other hand, Bihar was found to have the greatest proportion of untrained teachers at the elementary as well as the secondary school levels, with West Bengal emerging as the runner-up in the metric.

38.7 per cent and 35.1 per cent of Bihar's teachers were found to be professionally unqualified at the elementary and secondary levels respectively. In case of West Bengal, 35.1 per cent of its primary teachers and 23.9 per cent of its secondary teachers are untrained.

The study noted that despite increased budgetary spending on school education at the state level, the shortage of well-qualified teachers and poor infrastructure are major issues that continue to plague public schools."

The course will be implemented from the primary education level for which disbursal of funds have already started, he said. Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said.

Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The trained teachers will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity.

Measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight should be regularly done among school students, he said. ""The instruments for measuring these parameters will be bought by the schools from funds provided by the department, mainly meant for this purpose,"" he said.

The NITI Ayog has suggested this idea in 'Strategy For New India AT 75.' But the suggestion of Ayog is important in view of digital literacy of the country being around at 10 per cent at the moment. A huge population of the country does not have computer, laptop and smart phone. So the government needs special attention on digital literacy in the country.

Tawde said the government would pick 25 private schools and 25 aided schools, along with 50 government schools, as the first 100 schools under the board. ""We have got around 40-45 applications from private schools this year, so we decided to allow a few good private schools to join,"" he said.

Heramb Kulkarni, an educationist from the state, said the government needs to be careful before allowing private schools to become a part of the initiative. ""While some private schools are doing good work, they need to set criteria for selection. The move should not benefit schools run by politicians and big corporates,"" he said.

Government schools that would become a part of the selected 100 will be named 'Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari International School' in the memory of the late former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Currently, 13 schools in the state are being run as per the MIEB curriculum on a pilot basis. ""We want to ensure people pick state's international schools over international boards. Experts who are a part of the initiative have come up with a great curriculum,"" said Tawde."

The previous BJP government increased the time of school by an hour in 2014. Teachers across the state had opposed the increase of the school timing but the government did not reduce it. For the last four years, teachers have been agitating while demanding reducing school time.

The Congress promised to reduce school time in its election manifesto and so teachers are now reminding the Congress government of its promise.

Similarly, teachers' training camps are organised every year in the state. These camps were non-residential during the previous Congress government's tenure. The BJP government had ordered to conduct residential teacher training camp three years ago and teachers across the state had protested against it. Teachers in different districts of the state boycotted these camps forcing the previous BJP government to take disciplinary action against them.

Now the government has changed in the state and so teachers are demanding that these camps be made non-residential.

This decision has been taken after the central government, in July this year, scrapped the 'No detention policy', thereby allowing states to detain children in class 5 and 8.

Earlier, schools could not detain or make any child repeat a class until Class 8. The amendment to Section 16 of the Right To Education Act, takes away the important 'no detention policy' which was enforced in 2010.

Confirming the same, Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state education minister, said, ""All the damage in the state of Gujarat has been done due to the no detention policy. Due to the policy, fear among students had gone which led to poor results. Not just students, even the parents stopped paying attention to their studies. With no exams till class 8, how do you expect a child to perform well in higher standards? The result of the policy was seen during board exams.""

While the centre has asked states to conduct exams in class 5 and 8, we are likely to introduce the same for class 3 also. The issue is pending in Rajya Sabha now. Once we get the nod, we will be implementing the same.""

The seventh edition of Gunotsav, annual drive to ascertain learning levels of primary school students, had revealed shocking results, with nearly 6 lakh of the 21 lakh surveyed could not do basic reading, writing or arithmetic.

Lauding the centre's decision of scrapping No detention policy, Anisha Shaikh, Principal, FD School for Girls, said, ""It is a great move as the quality of education was deteriorating and we were the sufferers. In class 9, we as teachers had to start from zero as most students would not know basics as we had to promote them. Now even the parents will be concerned for the students future.""

However, she feels that exams should not be introduced in class 3. ""For classes 1-4, focus should be on reading, writing and learning rather than exams.

Gaps in infrastructure and lack of awareness are among the primary reasons why the Directorate of Education (DoE) has failed to draw applicants to seats reserved for differently abled children in the city's private schools.

For the first time this year, a three per cent quota for children with special needs was introduced within the 25 per cent EWS/DG category. Despite inviting applications thrice for about 1,300 seats in the category, 1,268 seats are still lying vacant with no applicants. The fourth draw of lots for these seats, to allot schools to applicants, will be conducted on Wednesday.

The Indian Express looked at reports of inspections carried out by the DoE across popular private schools in the city in 2015, to find that most lack the adequate number of special educators, disabled-friendly washrooms and even signage.

The DoE had inspected schools which were identified as having infrastructure to cater to differently abled children.

Of the 162 schools that were inspected to check for facilities for visually impaired students, 156 did not have Braille books, 132 did not have large print books and 143 did not have embossed maps and globes. Only five had Braille signage and 158 lacked tactile pathways. Special educators were missing in 114 schools and 110 did not have disabled-friendly washrooms.

Advertising ExplainedNot enough special educators in MCD, govt schools

Schools in Delhi -- government and private -- are unequipped to cater to students with special needs. In South and North Municipal Corporation schools, there are only 63 special educators against 1,084 sanctioned posts. Even in the city's government schools, the number of special educators is much lower than the requirement. Despite court orders and studies that make a case for integration of children in the same classroom, those with special needs are mostly sent to specialised schools. While specialised attention for differently abled children is required in many cases, there is barely any regulatory mechanism to monitor the functioning of these schools.

Of 169 schools inspected for facilities for those with hearing impairment, 160 did not have a speech therapist and 112 did not have visual and digital signage. Most schools out of 145 schools inspected for facilities for children with autism did not have tools of educational functional, language and communication, social behaviour and motor skills assessment.

According to disability rights activist Dr Satender Singh, one of the main reasons that such few applications come to schools is the lack of inclusive and accessible infrastructure and tools in schools. ""How many schools in Delhi are even accessible for persons with disabilities and how many have qualified special educators to help these students? There are also a number of learning disorders such as dyslexia, which require special teaching and learning tools. Given the gap, parents will prefer to send their children to specialised schools,"" he said.

The government also sees the lack of awareness as a challenge. Director of Education Sanjay Goel said that the department aims to step up publicity for these seats in the coming academic year. ""We will try to increase awareness about these seats. This is also the first time that this quota is being operationalised; once more students start taking admission through it, hopefully awareness will increase and we will also be able to encourage schools to improve their infrastructure,"" he said.

The process for nursery admissions for the 2019-20 session is already underway for applicants under the general category. The directorate, meanwhile, is yet to release the admission schedule for the EWS/DG category."
"162","1026412752","2018-12-25","http://risingkashmir.com/news/muslim-women-in-contemporary-times","Muslim women in contemporary times","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"The book begins with an introduction and followed by twelve chapters of different dimensions regarding the position of women in Islam. The first chapter entitled 'Roles of Quran and Hadith in Islamic Law' is an exploration of the respective roles of the Quran and the Hadith in Islamic law, emphasizing the Quran's role as the supreme authority followed by a discussion of these two primary sources (Quran and Hadith) of Islamic law.

The author had emphasized the fact that these two sources supersede all claims by all authorities including the founders of the four schools of Sunni law. The author in the second chapter deliberates an extensive discussion on the reward and punishment of men and women as prescribed by the Quran pointing out clearly that both the sexes are treated equally by God in the life hereafter.

The third chapter of the book is focused on the Quran's dealing with the origin of men and women. The chapter also explores how the Quran prescribes complete equality of men and women regarding their origin. The author subsequently had tried to simplify Quran's attitude towards women in the preceding three chapters but the fourth chapter is totally contradictory to the ideas presented by some 'alleged' sayings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

The author in this chapter questions the authenticity of these 'alleged sayings' and shows why they cannot be accepted as genuine. However, the author seems misrepresenting various things and didn't owe any explanations to them.

The fifth chapter entitled as ""Rules of Marriage in Islam"" starts with various forms of marriage in pre-Islamic Arabia. As the background of Islamic rules on this subject, the author had raised few important questions why muta (temporary) marriage, concubinage, and the rules of akfa are contrary to the rules of marriage in Islam.

The chapter then turns to discuss specific aspects of Islamic marriage including the independence of Muslim women to marry without a marriage guardian; child marriages; polygamous marriages; and marriages of Muslims with non-Muslims. The author however in this chapter is very much inconsistent while discussing the inter-community marriages.

The author in the sixth chapter had explored the respective positions of the husband and wife as prescribed by Islam and have endeavored to explain whether equality exists within this relationship or not. The seventh chapter's subject matter is on the rules of dissolution of marriage in Islam where the author had subdivided it into three topics, namely, unilateral dissolution of the marriage by the husband; the wife's right to divorce her husband; and the roles of the court and of the arbitrators in the dissolution of marriage.

While discussing the unilateral dissolution of the marriage by the husband, the author had tried to remain engrossed on the current practice of talaq (divorce) in one sitting and dispensing with the intervention of arbitrators in talaq. The eighth chapter directly addresses the rights of men and women in custody and access to children.

The ninth chapter deals with the financial and economic provisions for women in Islam. This chapter is divided into three subtopics, namely, women's rights of inheritance; women's rights of maintenance from her husband or from her husband's estate; and women's right of mahr (dower). The author claims that the inferior rights of women in inheritance have traditionally been controversial.

When addressing this issue he had tried to show that the lesser rights of women can be remedied by the wills of a testator. The tenth chapter is revolved around the Islamic rules regarding the women as witnesses. The author had tried to dissect the discourse about women's equality with men in this sphere but there are some arguments which are not convincing enough for the reader.

The author in the last two chapters (eleventh and twelfth) had dealt with two of the most controversial topics relating to women. In discussing Islamic rules regarding the seclusion of women in chapter eleven, the author points out that the current Islamic practice in many parts of the world is far from the rules laid down by the Quran and the Hadith. The questionable practice of seclusion of Muslim women in some societies is challenged, and a woman's right to participate in all activities of society is affirmed.

The twelfth chapter which is more controversial explores the woman's right to participate in politics and to become a head of state. The author demonstrates that this subject has invited a great deal of interest among both Muslims and non-Muslims, especially since the election of three Muslim women to the position of prime minister namely Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan, Khaleda Zia and HasinaWajed in Bangladesh and Sukornoputri in Indonesia.

The author calls this alleged saying and refutes the fact that the Prophet (PBUH) had opposed women's promotion to the position of head of state. Ironically, the author (though misleadingly) stresses upon the fact that there is nothing wrong or un-Islamic for a Muslim woman to be elevated to this position.

The book over all is a good read and may introduce the reader to the basis for calling for a reform of the position of Muslim women in contemporary times. However, the problematic part of it is that the author had miserably failed to comprehend the subsequent backlashes if these so called 'reforms' are reinforced in the present day Muslim world.

Not only this, the author had put sweeping arguments at various points of instances to demonstrate his line of thinking. The meager and less explained argument(s) on the part of the author leaves his account wanting in integrity and sincerity. Toeing the feministic line by the author also makes this book more contested in terms of its objectivity."

Talking to the media persons in Ranchi, School Education and Literacy Minister Neera Yadav said that the State Government is ready for talks and consider the logical demands made by them in a transparent manner. Notably, around 67000 para-teachers all over the State have been agitating for the last 38 days demanding regularisation of their services and other facilities on the lines of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal and have been staging indefinite rotation dharnas outside the residences of ministers in the State Government. Education in around 12000 primary and middle schools have been completely or partially been affected due to this deadlock.

""Even though we are ready for talks, the protesting para - teachers are not ready for it.even if they come tomorrow, we are ready for a discussion with an assurance that their demands, if rational, will be fulfilled. otherwise we will be forced to take strong step in the interest of the children,"" said Yadav.

Since, dialogue is the only solution to end any deadlock, they have been repeatedly being asked to come forward for talks so that the issues, whatever they might be, could be amicably discussed and resolved, she added. ""If they show some willingness for talks, we will further extend the deadline for another one day, in case they are reluctant to start the talks on Christmas,"" said Yadav.

""Future of thousands of students could not be put on stake anymore and hence they must come forward for talks or the Government is free to take steps to secure quality education to the children in this State,"" said the minister. Para teachers, on the other hand, are adamant on their demands and are not ready to bow down before the State Government. ""

After mohalla clinics, the Delhi government has set up 101 ""mohalla playschools"" or ""modern anganwadi hub centres"" for children from the economically disadvantaged families.

The centres are part of the Delhi government's ongoing reforms in the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme under which the anganwadi centres provide food, preschool education and primary health care to children up to six years of age and their mothers.

Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, who also looks after the women and child department, inaugurated the centres on Monday.

""We recognised that care for children starts from the time when they are in their mothers' wombs and learning starts from the day they are born. Our 10,000 plus anganwadi centres are the platform to provide this care and learning. In a way, these hubs are 'mohalla play schools' for the children of the common people who can't afford play schools otherwise,"" he said.

The centres, which will cater to children aged between 3 and 6, have been created by clubbing two or three existing angawadis in multiple locations, including Okhla, Kondli and Patparganj.

The centres were inaugurated by legislators of the respective areas. The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is also planning to come up with a new curriculum to make these children school-ready.

They have built a school by pooling Rs 2.20 crore with 24 classrooms and imparting English education alongside Kannada, and it is all set for inauguration.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so. Our mission began three year ago when theschool had only 30 children. Even those who had joined nearby English-medium schools have quit, and have taken admission here,"" says an elated Prakash while speaking to TOI.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

A proposal for 20 such schools with low enrolment was cleared by the north corporation's House meeting on Monday. These will give rise to 10 new schools.

Located mostly in the Karol Bagh, Narela and Rohini zones, these schools are currently running at places like Inderpuri, Pyare Lal Road, Shahbad Daulatpur, Nimari Colony, Shiv Nagar, Pratap Kunj, Avantika, Sangam Park, Molar Basti, Old Ranjeet Nagar, Azadpur Colony and Auchandi.

A senior corporation official attributed the decision to low enrolment, poor finances, and proper utilisation of resources. He gave the example of the proposal to merge Municipal Corporation Primary School (MCPS) Pyare Lal Road 2 and MCPS New Dev Nagar Co-ed School. ""Keeping in view better management, saving of posts and the poor economic condition of north corporation, it would be feasible to merge schools in case of availability of accommodation,"" he said.

The proposal also argues that more and more parents want to educate their wards in morning-shift schools. ""MCPS Pyarelal Road has 202 kids while the Dev Nagar school has 265. After merger, a school with 467 kids and 12 sections will be formed,"" the official said.

He added: ""There are many vacancies in other schools and the staff from the schools being closed down can be sent there. At the same time, we will be able to use the buildings and other infrastructure for purposes such as sports academies.""

The merger of the two schools alone would lead to a surplus of a principal, five teachers and two Class IV employees who could be reassigned. The official also said that 29 schools with low enrolment had been similarly shut down two years ago. But education experts have been criticising the corporations for their failure to enrol more children.

Khagesh Jha, a Supreme Court lawyer and education activist, remarked, ""If the corporation has extra land, why not add to the capital's school infrastructure so that more kids can be brought in the school system? There are more than 20 lakh kids outside the school system in the city. Besides, children from unrecognised schools too need to be brought to government schools.""

The north civic body runs 714 municipal primary schools, in which children, mostly from economically disadvantaged backgrounds, study. Enrolment in all corporation-run schools, however, has been declining steadily. Around 70,000 students have opted out of north schools since the 2012 trifurcation. It then had 3,70,648 students in its primary schools. This figure slid to 3,50,611 in 2013-14 and 3,14,022 in 2016-17. At present, around three lakh students are on the rolls."

WE, THE PEOPLE

RURAL: 2011- 833 mn, 1971- 438 mn (Photo: Sonu Kishan)

Strength in numbers

India still lives in its villages (69 per cent of the population). Large-scale migration, motivated primarily by the search for better employment opportunities, has resulted in the urban population growing from 109 million to 377 million between 1971 and 2011. Yet, it's not even half the total rural population, which nearly doubled from 438 million in 1971 to 833 million by 2011.

Falling short

Healthcare infrastructure in rural India may have improved gradually, but about 80 per cent of doctors and 75 per cent of dispensaries are serving urban India, says a 2016 KPMG-OPPI report. There was a 19 per cent shortfall in health sub-centres, 22 per cent shortfall in primary health centres and 30 per cent shortfall in community health centres at the end of March 2017, according to data from the National Health Mission's rural health statistics.

Data has been sourced from multiple agencies, such as the National Sample Survey Office, Union ministries, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy and NABARD.

Still miles to go

India has made tremendous progress in reducing the Infant Mortality Rate (IMR)-from 138 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1971 to 38 deaths in 2016. But this is still higher than the global average of 29 deaths per 1,000 live births (according to WHO). In life expectancy and IMR, India ranks behind neighbouring Bangladesh.

The 'Wasted' Generation

India accounts for 50 per cent of the world's undernourished children, says a 2017 joint study by Assocham and Ernst & Young. The 2018 Global Nutrition Report reveals that a third of the world's stunted children are also Indian. The country has the highest number of wasted.

The Missing Girls

The 58.7 per cent female literacy rate in rural India points to massive gender discrimination. The government' s Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao (BBBP) mission is a positive step towards empowering rural women, but only a determined societal movement can ensure higher enrolment of girls and women in schools/colleges.

Sad Facts

Poverty eradication is among the biggest challenges for development planners. Between 1993-94 and 2010-11, the rural population below the poverty line almost halved from 50.1 per cent to 25.7 per cent, but urban areas were more efficient in reducing poverty during the same period-from 31.8 per cent to 13.7 per cent.

Ending Open Defecation

Sanitation coverage in rural India, under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), has risen to 85 per cent, claims the ministry of drinking water and sanitation. According to the ministry, a recent survey conducted by an independent verification agency across 90,000 households in over 6,000 villages found the usage of toilets in rural India to be at 93.4 per cent. But in July 2018, the MoS for drinking water and sanitation had, in an answer to a question in Parliament, said that only 77 per cent rural households have access to toilets.

WORK WORRIES

Creditable but...

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), launched in 2006, guarantees 100 days of work in a financial year to rural households whose adult members volunteer for unskilled labour. However, MGNREGA is not designed to provide work that generates adequate annual income for a household to cross the poverty line. Undoubtedly, the productivity of urban workers has moved at a much faster pace than of their rural counterparts. Rural workers' real wage rate growth turned negative this year from a high growth rate in 2014.

Combining Forces

Self-help groups (SHGs) have been playing an important role in the economic and social advancement of the poor, especially women, in villages. There are now 4.5 million SHGs, with the active participation of 100 million women all over rural India, says NABARD. The annual offtake of loans was Rs 38,000 crore.

BANKING ON THE MASSES

The NDA government' s push to expand the formal economy brought 310 million people into the formal banking system in four years, as per the World Bank. But shortage of bank branches and ATMs and poor infrastructure in rural India created roadblocks. A pilot project on direct transfer of funds to villagers' accounts in Jharkhand showed people.

While the chill has got the poor and the homeless scrambling to shelter homes for cover, the general populace is left exposed to dangerously high particulate levels in the air.

Pre-Christmas cold catches many off-guard

The pre-Christmas cold this year has been surprising. Delhi on Sunday recorded its lowest morning temperature in four years at 3.7 degrees celsius. While for the weatherman this may not be out of the ordinary, over the past few years Delhites got used to experiencing such cold late in December or early January.

It is for this reasons that most of the schools in Delhi NCR have still not taken their winter recess. Most of them are scheduled to reopen after the Christmas break. In both adjoining Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, most of the schools are only scheduled to break for winter from next week.

SC monitoring has helped improve facilities for homeless

The worst hit by the cold are the homeless. Under the supervision of a Supreme Court-monitored committee, the Delhi government has developed an organised system of night shelters over the last five years. The death of around 164 people due to cold conditions in 2015-16 led to a lot of improvements in the night shelter scheme.

There are now 248 night shelters in the national capital. Of these, 83 operate out of permanent buildings, 115 from porta-cabins while 50 run from European style fireproof tents. These are managed by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board in association with non-governmental organisations and are being prepared to take in 19,000 people this year.

The shelters have been planned to cater to the poor across the city. The general benchmark is having one for every 10,000 people. Despite the spread, it is believed that they accessible to all the homeless and poor.

Snacks and hot water facilities being added

Last year, as against a capacity of over 17,000 beds, these shelters received only about 14,000 people. So this year, it was even decided to provide snacks in the form of tea and toasts to those coming in. But while that program was to kick in from the new year, the cold set in early.

All the shelters are providing a sheet, pillow, mattress and blankets to the visitors. Television sets have also been provided to keep the sojourners engaged. Arrangements for hot water have also been made in over 70 shelters this year. Constant vigil is also kept by caretakers and government staff to ensure that unwanted elements are kept out.

Those availing these shelters are usually the homeless or the casual workers, who normally sleep in the open or in covered spaces near their place of work.

As per a 2014 survey, Delhi has about 16,760 homeless. The United Nations Development Program put their numbers at 55,955. Unofficial estimates, however, suggest there are over 1.5 lakh people who live on the streets.

Strict rules make many still prefer sleeping in the open

While statistics dictate there should be a greater demand for these shelters (as there is no charge in winters), it has not been the case. Many poor and destitute still prefer sleeping in the open. The primary reason being that there are restrictions in place on entering shelter homes for those who are inebriated or under the influence of drugs. Also, many poor people believe they would get clothes, blankets and even money in alms if they would stay put in the open.

Low wind speed, burning of wood and waste take pollution to alarming levels

The cold conditions also lead to burning of a lot of bonfires as people adopt different means to stay warm. From wood to plastics and rubber tyres, every thing that can give heat is set alight. This along with low wind speeds has contributed to higher particulate matter levels in Delhi.

According to Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data, pollution levels have again reached alarming levels in many parts of the city. The PM10 and PM2.5 level in Anand Vihar was at 1,186 and 953 microgrammes per cubic metre which was over 10 times more than the safe level of 100 microgrammes for PM10 and 60 microgrammes for PM2.5.

Similarly, the situation was bad in several other areas such as Wazirpur and R.K. Puram. Most parts of the city were bracketed in the ""severe"" to ""emergency"" category because of the high air pollution levels."

For a first, Justin Jose, an MCA graduate from Kottayam created eTalenter, a system which automates and manages competitions, regardless of the event and institution.

This newly launched software is beneficial; competitions can be easily conducted without further hassles. The software has already been implemented to conduct seven successful events for churches and schools, the first one being in Thiruvananthapuram. Introduced in Kerala, Justin is the sole mastermind behind eTalenter. ""Competitions are difficult to organise nowadays with paper sheets. With the help of eTalenter, work is easier and quicker with no loss of time or difficulty. Such a software has not been developed before,"" says Justin, senior software engineer.

The software aims to limit the usage of paperwork and to digitalise details. Hours of manual work can be minimised and technical knowledge will not be a worry. The benefit of using this software is that no one can hack into it by faking results and the final result will be published on the website by the co-ordinators. The software is accessible both mobile and laptop. Events are created by the developer himself and a unique ID and password would be given to the event coordinator to control the whole event who would be able to edit it accordingly.

Time management and the token system are two primary features of the software. A token announcement calls out the participants ID or name with the help of a recorded voice before the competition begins and also alerts the judges or the coordinators along with a warning bell and stop bell. Judges can score marks through the online scorecard thereby easily marking them under each category and publishing the results instantly. ""eTalenter shines with its simple interface and makes talent management easy for all users,"" says an event coordinator.

The software is steadily gaining popularity and has been booked in advance, by schools, organisations and communities. eTalenter can easily make its mark in events like the school kalolsavam and university events, as they are the largest competitions in Kerala with numerous participants. Justin is looking forward to expanding the software across the whole country and does not want it to have a limited outreach."

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said.

The administration's move comes days after a wall of a private school collapsed in Noida's Salarpur village, killing two children and injuring three others.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work. All this is being done without creation of any rights of any type and is purely under the CSR initiative,"" he said.

As many as 580 schools in the four blocks of the district -- Bisrakh, Dadri, Dankaur and Jewar -- are up for adoption and proposals for this could be sent to the administration by January 15, 2019, the magistrate said.

""I reiterate that this will be only under the CSR initiative and all rights shall be reserved with the administration,"" Singh said.

Children are trickling in to a government primary school in Raipur, in sub-urban Dehradun, and jostling for space on jute mats spread inside the classrooms as well as outside the classes on the school premises.

The school has 144 students but does not have a single piece of furniture or boundary wall on one side, posing a security threat.

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

""We received money from the government and have disbursed it to different districts but issuing of tender and other such procedures may take time,"" said VS Rawat, additional director, elementary education."

The typical Indian investor does not bother too much about company managements. You can see this behaviour particularly evident in times of an IPO deluge. Most IPO investors don't know the antecedents of managements selling them shares - more disturbing is the fact that most don't care. The only thing that matters is what the premiums are going for in the grey markets. We show how no company can escape the quality of their management.

Busting the myth

The integrity of the management is a concept that is oft repeated yet little sought after. But that's the key thing. Think of Narayana Murthy of Infosys, Azim Premji of Wipro or Ratan Tata. These are all individuals with integrity and people with whom you can trust your money with.

Passion is the first thing to look for. Passion and integrity are some of the most important things that Buffett looks out for when prospecting a company to buy. Why? The passion for the business will ensure that managers will breathe, sleep and live for the company. TCS MD, N Chandrasekaran is said to be one of the most passionate leaders of an IT company in India. His unrelenting focus and commitment to his work now puts TCS ahead of industry bellwether - Infosys. Says Buffett, ""Passion is the number one thing that I look for in a manager. IQ isn't that important. They need to be able to work well with others and the ability to get people to do what you want them to do. I'd say intelligence, energy, integrity. If you don't have the last one, the first two will kill you. All you have is a crook who works hard,"" (Q&A with six business schools, 2009).

What is the management's key responsibility? The primary responsibility of every manager is to allocate capital effectively. How the manager uses the company's retained earnings or new funds will determine how far the company can go. Yet, as Buffett points out, very few manages are trained in capital allocation. Many Indian promoters got swept up in the boom years of between 2003-2007. They decided they needed to go global and chased large acquisitions world-wide - actions they would pay dearly for a long time to come.

Suzlon picked up a lot of debt to become one of the largest wind-power companies in the world. Vishal Retail spread itself too thin-too fast and then eventually folded up. Bharti Airtel in recent years made a big acquisition in Africa and it still is paying for it. These are all capital allocation gone wrong. On the other hand you had conservative managements of companies like Lakshmi Machine Works and Elgi Equipments. They didn't get swept in the euphoria. Because their managements were conservative and now seemingly more sensible. Companies like these have remained in business for decades and have carved a niche for themselves.

Test of a good management. According to Buffett there are two ways to asses a management:

How have their results been?

How do they treat the company's shareholders? (Berkshire Annual Meeting 1994)

In India we usually never talk about the management until it has been caught doing something wrong (think Ramalinga Raju of Satyam). And even in those incidents we treat them as isolated incidences. How transparent are the books of Indian realty companies? We don't really know, but there are many investors who see opportunities in them.

The Government is one of the worst offenders when it comes to the interest of shareholders. Time and again, company after company, the Government has destroyed value for its shareholders. The instances of ONGC, OIL, Engineers India, all strong companies in their fields serve as standout examples. Yet whenever there is fresh talk of divestment, PSU stocks get spiked up by investor interest. There's investor apathy there for you.

Here's Buffett discussing management passion in a lighter note. ""Our prototype for occupational fervour is the Catholic tailor who used his small savings of many years to finance a pilgrimage to the Vatican. When he returned, his parish held a special meeting to get his first-hand account of the Pope. ""Tell us,"" said the eager faithful, ""just what sort of fellow is he?"" Our hero wasted no words: ""He's a 44, medium,"" (Berkshire Annual Letter 1986)."

INOX Air Products, has started to implement its CSR campaign through Mrida, a Social Business Venture focused on sustainable and scalable holistic rural development. INOX Air Products, one of the largest manufacturers of Industrial gases in India with 36 plants spread across the country, will work with Mrida for sustainable and holistic development of selected villages and hamlets in Bokaro District of Jharkhand. The project is called ""Udaan, the Wings of Transformation"" and is focusing on bringing about a developmental change in the villages.

As a part of their CSR initiatives, INOX Air Products has started to focus on holistic rural development and initially taken up 2 villages (Jharnamuri and Bajudih) for their campaign. These are around 19 kms from Bokaro Steel Plant, where INOXAP has its on-site liquid production unit. These initiatives will be undertaken for a period of 34 months and began from June 2018.

""Since the rural areas are often the most in need of development, INOXAP decided to focus on them. We were on the lookout for a partner who could help us positively impact the lives of these communities and work closely with them for their social and economic welfare. We firmly believe that our program with Mrida will help better thelives of the people in these areas and that together we can make them a powerful and empowered community"", says Mr. Surendra Choudhary, Chief Financial Officer, INOX Air Products Pvt.

These include agri-inputs,education, sanitation, energy access, clean water supply, healthcare and hygiene initiatives, livelihood generation activities to begin with and the scope of activities will be modified as the project progresses.

""As a concerned corporate citizen, INOXAP had been committing valuable resources to ensure that the communities in and around their plants benefit from their initiatives. We will work together to ensure that a positive, measurable, scalable and sustainable Impact is created on the lives of the people, in the areas that we operate in. Mrida believes in holistic development and with INOXAP's way of thinking there is a huge synergy in what can be done. We are hopeful and our work will speak for itself in a short time"", says Mr Arun Nagpal, Co-Founder and CEO, Mrida Group.

INOXAP through Mrida has already undertaken the following for the Villages in Bokaro:

Community mobilization was the pre-requisite for sustainable development initiative at these villages. The buy in from people would only come about after they were directly involved in the decision making process. Today, villagers are a part of a Village Development Committee and take decisions about the developmentinitiatives directly in consultation with the Mrida Team.

Existing Solar LED Street Light network has been strengthened by repairing existing lights and installing new ones as per need, so that the safety and security of those in these areas can be reinforced. 100% coverage has already been achieved in both villages.

Since safety and health of the villagers is one of the main concerns, availability of clean drinking water to the households becomes very important. As a result,Solar Powered pumping and purification system plant has been installed in Jharnamuri village on a community-based model where villagers pay Rs. 20 per month from each household to the Village Development Committee for availing the services. The money thus collected is utilized for the upkeep of the systemover time and makes the intervention self-sustainable. A water purificationsystem has been installed in the Govt. Middle School for the school students. The Pipeline work for water to school toilets has also been completed.

Creating sustainable and scalable livelihood generation opportunities including encouraging micro entrepreneurship and all-round community engagement will be another area of operation. 2 Stitching centres have already been established and training program initiated for 32 students across 2 villages. Incense Sticks value addition and marketing training imparted for 30 women and local linkages being created: Business already flowing in for them.

It is planned that the following will be also focused on in the next phase:

Setting up of Solar Powered E-Hubs to provide education, entertainment and E-Commerce facilities.

These are predominantly agrarian communities and the farmers are still using traditional methods of cultivation. An in-depth agri-input program focused on bettering yields and focused on high value crops will be undertaken to improve productivity and income levels of the farmers.

Working closely with the existing state-aided primary schools to ensure that more and more children can benefit from the education imparted.

Health and Nutrition related initiatives: This will start with the health baseline survey of the villagers through medical/health camps and based on the results of the survey, subsequent interventions to improve on the basic health index would be undertaken.

Installation of Solar Water Pumping & Purification system in Village Bajudih on similar lines.

Strengthening local leadership at the Village level in the form of Village Development Committees (VDCs) to play an active role in the entire initiative. The idea is for the VDC to eventually take over ongoing activities with minimal involvement of the INOX and Mrida."

Gymnastics is considered as one of most famous and prestigious sports categories in the Olympics. Gymnastics develops flexibility, strength, coordination, motor skills and balance. It's no wonder that those who aspire to taste Olympics glory undergo rigorous training, which often starts at an early age. For a gymnast to be successful, two things are of prime importance: the gymnast's core strength and proper equipment. One such equipment essential for strength building and initial training is the gymnastic bench.

A gymnastic bench is a structure with a wooden board and legs with hooks attached to one side, which fixes the attachment to a vault box or a wall. Gymnastic benches can be set to different inclines, allowing varying levels of exercise intensity. A gymnastic bench is designed for exercising in the sitting position, hall laying position or lying position. Gymnastic bench legs are equipped with an anti-slip rubber (usually PVC) coating to improve stability.

The use of lightweight and economic gymnastic benches as an alternative to traditional ones is trending in schools. These are manufactured from a differently chosen, light timber.

There has been a lot of debate about long-term effects of gymnastics in an athlete's body, particularly women. Stress fractures are common amongst gymnasts and such issues hinder gymnast participation and consequently, gymnastic bench sales.

Jashn-e-Rekhta, an organisation dedicated to the preservation and promotion of the Urdu language, its literature and culture, recently concluded its 5th edition in Delhi last week. Jashn-e-Rekhta, which literally means 'the festival of Urdu', has been extremely successful in attracting huge audiences to its events built around Urdu. The popularity of the event has led to the establishment of another organization, Rang-e-Rekhta, curated by the Rekhta Foundation, which takes the success of Urdu to other cities. So far it has held three events in Chandigarh, Jaipur and Gurugram.

This apparent success of Urdu also raises an important question about the de facto status of Urdu in India. Scholarly studies show that Urdu has suffered marginalisation and that its social landscape is shrinking. Against this backdrop, many claim that the success of Jashn marks the revival of the Urdu language and literature. For instance, the Bollywood artist Javed Jaffrey said: ""Urdu khatre mein nahin hai, Urdu to qatre qatre mein hai (Urdu is not in danger; Urdu is actually in every drop)."" This pithy line received a round of applause from the audience. Tanweer Ahmad of the Urdu Qaumi Awaz made it into a headline.

Similar claims were made at the end of the 2017 Jashn festival. Malini Nayar of the Times of India dismissed the idea that Urdu was dying. She too echoed the jubilation and enthusiasm about Urdu's revival with her headline, 'Urdu language is not only alive but rocking.' Urdu newspapers followed suit. The Siasat Daily published a report on the role of Jashn in reviving Urdu with the headline, 'Jashn-e-Rekhta has proved that Urdu is not only alive but is creating waves'. Twitter resonated with the excitement of revival too.

Such views about its 'revival' and 'resurgence' overlook the ground reality that Urdu is actually in sharp decline in North India, especially in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, considered its traditional strongholds. Clearly, if there is a revival, it will mean that the young generation, who will be the carriers of the language, is learning it. The attendance at a Jashn festival or a mushaira or a qawwali is not an indicator of the revival of a language.

Sudha Pai, a scholar of political science, notes that other than the two Urdu medium schools run by Aligarh Muslim University, there is not one single primary or junior high school in the whole of UP where Urdu is fully the medium of instruction . The symbolic second language status accorded to Urdu by the UP government has not arrested its decline either. The recommendations of Gujral Committee (1975), the Ale Ahmad Suroor Committee (1979), and the Ali Sardar Jafri Committee (1990) to revive and popularise Urdu have never been implemented.

The situation of Urdu teaching in Delhi is no less gloomy. As per an RTI filed in 2013, a whopping 73% of posts for Urdu teachers within Delhi government schools are vacant. This despite the fact that Urdu has been granted the second official language status in Delhi. Furthermore, 74 out of 80 textbooks needed in Urdu schools were not available in the market. The result was an abnormally high failure rate in Urdu schools in Delhi.

For the claim of Urdu revival to be true, it follows that the young generation has the opportunity to learn its script as well. This point was stressed by Gulzar, the legendary Bollywood figure in the 2017 Rekhta festival. A declining proficiency in the Urdu script can be seen in the mushrooming of Urdu books transliterated into Devanagari found in Urdu Bazar, Old Delhi. Urdu in Devanagari has emerged as a response to the lack of proficiency in the script among the younger generation of speakers in Delhi and UP.

Another indicator of its decline in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi is the loss of the pronunciation of Urdu sounds, especially /kh̲/,/gh̲/, and /q/, as in kh̲uda (God) gh̲alat (wrong) and qalam (pen) respectively. Considered the shibboleths of Urdu as a language, the young generation is increasingly non-observant of these sounds. The decline interestingly is also visible in the pronunciation of words in Bollywood songs; the new generation of singers pronounce words containing these sounds using the Hindi pronunciation norms.

So what does the success of Jashn festival actually mean? In my view, it says little about the 'health' of the language and more about the marketing of the event. First of all, utilising the linkages between Urdu and popular culture, they have successfully galvanised Bollywood celebrities to promote it. Not all the Bollywood stars who have graced the Jashn are stars of Urdu language and literature. But they are all big crowd pullers.

Secondly, on the socio-political front, Urdu is no longer a force to reckon with as it has lost its battle for survival in North India. Such events are, therefore, aimed at the elite - especially the English educated ones. The first few editions did not have the Jashn-e-Rekhta written in Urdu. The recent ones did include the Urdu script. However, the schedules were available only in English. The big 'I LOVE URDU' cut-out where the youth were seen taking pictures was only in English. Both speak volumes about the targeted audience.

The English-speaking elite, however, has not embraced Urdu as it is. This elite has a romanticised and orientalised view of the language of love, beauty, politeness, tahzeeb and romance. Contrary to this, for its traditional speakers, Urdu is a world of myriad lived experiences which include, but are not limited to, love, romance and politeness. For them, Urdu is as much about love (mohabbat) as it is about revolt and revolution (inqilab). The new admirers of Urdu may not know that Urdu has some of the strongest expletives as well.

The success of Jashn-e-Rekhta, then, seems to be analogous to the popularity of sarson ka saag and makke ki roti in elite hotels and restaurants where the dish is an exotica - an occasional item on the menu rather than a lived experience of a villager. For the non-Urdu elites, it is more a matter of yaadgaar - something memorable, butwhich also means an old building - than a matter of rozgaar, or employment."

While the inauguration and stone laying ceremony will be telecast live through BISAG (Bhaskaracharya Institute for Space Applications and Geoinformatics) across the state, the CM will interact with students, villagers and teachers in various districts.

In a similar programme the following day, projects worth Rs 31 crore under the state revenue department will be inaugurated, including taluka seva sadan buildings with five mamtaldar offices and two talati offices in Ahmedabad.

The facts are startling. Close to 15 million individuals in India are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder/ social communication disorder. Nearly 35 million children in India have dyslexia, a common learning disorder. Down syndrome occurs in one in every 830 live births in the country. At least 11% of India's primary school children have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The harsh truth is there aren't enough trained professionals and facilities available for special needs children. Schools are not sufficiently equipped to address special needs. Parents and caregivers aren't enabled to support the special needs children in their care. However, a first-of-its-kind startup called Mom's Belief is trying to make a difference in the lives of people with special needs children. The startup was launched in 2015 to support parents of special needs children and their care-givers to enable and empower them.

""So far, we have been able to touch 1,000 families across India and five international locations, which is five times more than we had planned to serve,"" says Nitin Bindlish, founder and CEO, Mom's Belief. The Mom's Belief home programme empowers parents to support their special needs child in the absence of accessible and affordable services, operating from its base outside Delhi. A dedicated, masters-level child psychologist is assigned to each family. Psychologists connect with parents using video conferencing, phone, email, and instant messaging. Guided by a team with expertise in child psychology, pediatric neurology, occupational/speech therapy and special education, the psychologist helps parents to identify goals and create monthly individualised education plans. Teaching tools are delivered to the home every month.

As support is provided remotely, Mom's Belief works only with children who have a diagnosis. It uses the child's medical history and a skill and development assessment to create a neurodevelopmental profile, which guides the creation of IEPs and acts as the baseline against which progress is measured. The programme is offered on a subscription basis. ""Technology is at the core of all our activities, and we use it to support parents and professionals. For instance, we are developing tools that will help parents understand their child's likely growth trajectory and map out plans for the future,"" says Bindlish. ""Digital platforms connect us with parents and professionals who care for special needs children. They also help us reach families in more remote areas. Parents can use Skype to virtually bring their dedicated child psychologist into their home.""

Initial funding for the startup came from personal investment, and friends and family. ""We have drawn the attention of investors from all over the world who are impressed with our empowerment model, which is scalable, effective and affordable,"" says Bindlish. ""When you empower a mother with professional guidance and resources, she can help her child overcome the challenges of a developmental disorder and fulfill his or her potential. Therefore, we want to empower parents to act as ""co-therapist"" for their child at home and empower professionals to provide more integrated solutions at therapy centers, schools, and hospitals,"" he informs.

Mom's Belief addresses disorders such as autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, learning disabilities, intellectual disability, Down syndrome, global developmental delay, and mental health issues. ""We complement our home-based programme with support for schools and therapy centres to create an ecosystem of support. This also helps to build awareness and acceptance, particularly in schools,"" he adds. According to him, after three years in the R&D phase the company launched its programmes early this year and have touched the lives of 1,000+ families so far. Mom's Belief wants to touch 10,000-plus families in the coming years in multiple countries."

With admissions for the pre-primary classes getting underway, Secretary, Punjab Education, hit the road and went door to door asking the parents to send their kids to government schools. This unusual drive is part of the department's efforts to ensure that admissions in pre-primary classes cross the figure of one lakh students.

In past four days since the admissions began, over 25,000 children between ages 3 to 6 have been admitted in the pre-primary classes.

On Saturday, Secretary Education, Punjab, Krishan Kumar, along with the staff of Education Department visited homes in Mohali District area to make the parents aware about pre-primary classes being offered at government schools.

""It is quite unusual as hardly any senior officer would go door to door like Secretary, Education, who is one of the senior most officers of Punjab not only in Education Department but otherwise,"" said a teacher who accompanied the secretary along with several other staff members, adding that due to his efforts over several government schools in Punjab have already got a much better infrastructure.

The teacher added that by the end of this year over 4000 schools would be given the same facelift.

Those accompanying the Krishan Kumar carried a placard that read: ""Na koi fees, na koi basta, sarkari school sab ton sasta (no fee nor bag, government schools are the cheaper places to teach you wards), in their hands. He appealed the parents do teach your children. He also said that each one should bring one child to school.

Pre-primary classes were started in the 12,500 primary and elementary schools of Punjab last year when 1.70 lakh children were admitted in nursery and kindergarten classes. This year in district teachers' have been asked to ensure maximum admissions from their areas, said Secretary Education. In villages, announcements are also being made from religious places urging parents to get their children enrolled."

A range of bags adorns one wall of a small store in Dhamani village in Pune district. Mangal Wagh arranges newly acquired beauty products on a shelf along the other. Passersby slow down to wave or call out a greeting to her.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh (39) would step out of her house to work as a daily wager to look after her family of four. She had to take up work after her husband became paralysed. Today, Ms. Wagh owns a shop that offers wallets, handbags, schoolbags and beauty products, which are popular with women in the village.

Ms. Wagh owes her financial independence to the Ernst And Young Foundation and the Srinivasan Services Trust (SST), the social services arm of TVS Motors. The two organisations have been empowering women by setting up self-help groups in over 100 villages in Pune district.

Three years ago, Ms. Wagh took a loan of ₹20,000 and rented a shop in her village. Today, she teaches five children to make bags and is looking to expand her business. She said, ""I want to learn micro design in embroidery to sell more items. Hardly any shops offer these services here, so people come to me.""

Roopa Sanghuri from Wafgaon village shares a similar story. From being the owner of two cows and a few goats, Ms. Sanghuri now runs a beauty parlour after borrowing ₹10,000 from the self-help group in her village. ""I wanted to save for my daughter. Now, the parlour is running well and I earn around ₹300 per day and save ₹700 a month,"" Ms. Sanghuri said.

Financial independence has changed not only the lifestyle of these women, but also their outlook and standing. They are more confident and are respected in their villages. Sridhar Iyer, national director, EY Foundation India, said, ""Economic independence has a major role to play in women's social empowerment. We are trying to solve monetary issues of rural women by educating them on formal borrowing and low cost, sustainable means of livelihood.""

The self-help groups meet every month and discuss solutions to issues faced by women and their villages. The Gulani village, for instance, was facing water scarcity for seven years due to irregular monsoon, and the lake in the village could not meet the needs of 250 families. Most people had to fetch water from other villages, and the chore fell to the women, who had to walk two to three kilometres every day to get water.

With EY-SST's guidance and help, the women desilted the lake in May last year at a cost of ₹4 lakh. The women met 60% of the expenses through crowdfunding, while EY-SST provided the rest. The village now has water, and the fertile soil from the desilting work resulted in a better crop for farmers.

EY-SST has also helped renovate government primary schools in Khed taluka. Trees were planted, toilets built and school walls painted, prompting parents to withdraw their children from private schools and send them to government schools. The EY-SST operates self-help groups in 2,000 villages in 10 States with the help of local non-profit organisations, and 478 groups in 162 villages in Pune district."

With just three months left for the conclusion of the current academic year, Samagra Shiksha, Keralam, is gearing up to utilise the funds allocated for various projects for school students on time.

The Union government merged the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikshak Abhiyan to form Samagra Shiksha early this year.

Improvement of academic standards as well as infrastructure development at schools from pre-primary to Class 12 were brought within its ambit. However, there had been a delay in convening a meeting of functionaries of the new entity, which also resulted in many projects getting stuck. As the non-utilisation of allocated funds this academic year may lead to the Centre reducing the funds next year, a State-level workshop is now being held in Kozhikode.

K.J. Harikumar, State Programme Officer, Samgra Shiksha, Keralam, told The Hindu on Sunday that it had been decided to conduct a 'Mikavulsavam' for students of Classes 1 to 7 in aided and government schools to improve academic standards. English teachers in higher secondary schools will be given special training. They would be given Malayalam translations of history, geography and economics textbooks, he added.

According to sources, coordinators of the programme from 14 districts and Block Resource Centre functionaries are participating in the workshop. It has been decided to complete the construction of science parks in all aided and government schools under the aegis of Samgra Shiksha, by the next academic year. The ongoing projects to improve the efficiency of students in science, mathematics, and English, Malayalam and Hindi will be modified and rearranged, if necessary."

I have been reading articles on Scroll.in for the last couple of days and they seem to be unbiased, informative and vividly written. Some of the videos that show up on Facebook are also pretty interesting. Coming to Saiba Varma's article on Kashmir's pellet victims, I completely agree with the columnist, but she leaves a few questions unanswered.

The civilians of Kashmir should not suffer the way they are suffering, and pellet guns should not be used, but neither should soldiers be targetted by enraged groups who want to register their protest against the government or the system. The people of India are indifferent to the pictures of Kashmiris being hit by pellets or even to the photograph of Omran Daqneesh from the Syrian war, because they feel that it's not their problem to solve. Safety is important for our fellow countrymen in Kashmir but soldiers should not be made the punching bag of an angry mob. How do we ensure soldiers' safety? - Shayon Deb Roy

I fail to understand how stone pelting is related to anyone's status (""Among seven civilians killed in Kashmir, a cricket crazy teen, a commerce student, a young father""). This article's headline indicates to me that you have a soft corner for stone pelters and instead of writing about non-violence, this website is trying to garner sympathy for stone pelters. - C Patwal

As usual, Scroll.in is peddling a biased narrative. What author conveniently omitted is that these individuals were present in in anti-national crowds who were reportedly pelting stones on the troops. - Lokender Singh

I appreciate you for putting up stories of those who died during encounters today. Every civilian casualty is our loss. However, when was the last time a news publication highlighted stories of army men killed in counter-insurgency operations or cease fire violations? I request Scroll.in to bring out the other side of the story and give our men the they deserve. - Mukunda Murthi Rao

***

The army command of Pulwama has repeatedly asked people to urge youngsters to refrain from terrorist acts or not to support militants. A recent video showed an officer doing the same. He also asked the elderly to try to bring their sons or relatives back militancy and surrender and assured that the Army would cordially accept them and not do any harm! So when the Army has taken all these steps and issued warnings, why are civilians so angry when action is taken? Don't the locals want peace in Kashmir? The more the adamancy, the higher number of lives that are sacrificed. - Sailok

Thank you for highlighting this. Without this, it would have been very difficult for readers to understand how the military is working in Jammu and Kashmir. However you have missed the chance of writing one line to mark respect for the soldier who died protecting people like you and me, who died very far from his home and his family. - Anil Patil

General Rawat spoke in a very even, matter-of-fact way during his interview (""'An embarrassment for the country': Twitter reacts to army chief Bipin Rawat's sexist comments""). Times are changing and our people, especially men, are slowly getting accustomed to women working shoulder-to-shoulder with them. It will take time for our jawans, most of whom come from the hinterland where patriarchy is more prevalent, to change their thinking and to accept marching alongside women, or even take commands from them. General Rawat knows what he is talking about. He knows his men well. - Rowena

***

Don't have a sheepish mentality. General Rawat is simply being practical. War is a hazardous occupation. Women are not made for it. They cannot lift heavy machine guns. They cannot endure torture. Many more such examples can be given.The general has a very concerned and caring attitude towards women. It would be clear to you if you ponder over his statement with a cool head.

Women make a seminal contribution to the lives of men. In return, is it not the duty of menfolk to care for them and protect them? Can we afford to imperil the lives of our women at dangerous war fronts? There are many walks of life where women are better than men and many jobs are available to them that provide them a chance to establish their own independent identity and also give them a chance to be prosperous.In my opinion, hyping the issue of women getting into the military is not proper. - Abhinav Kumar

I have heard Thol Thirumavalavan speak in discussions and TV interviews (""The TM Krishna column: Why are India's Dalit thought leaders always reduced to their caste identity?""). It is unfortunate he is imprisoned in his caste or social class. Among Tamil politicians, he has credentials to be come Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu - he is young, experienced, and can be a national leader too. He is not a firebrand but is level-headed. At the same time, he is aware of sufferings of Dalits in Indian society. I have read the books of Bama and Salma too. Even other Indian religions look down on the marginalised sections of their faiths. Perhaps I am also like Krishna, born into an upper caste, and hope I am not misunderstood as being patronising to Thirumavalavan. - R Venkat

***

As pointed out in this article, the image created about public individuals from marginalised sections arises not when they illustrate their intellectual prowess but on their demonstration of resistance in violation of existing norms. It is natural for affected people to hold and propagate opinions about the disruptor which can be reformed by reasoning subsequently. More than theirs, it is the opinion of marginalised sections that place the defying nature above everything else and this as an identity is installed on such public individuals. For them, the ability to take issues head on is of primary importance. - Karthik G

***

Does the irony of this article strike the author when he himself is guilty of constantly reducing Brahmins to their caste identity? And how does one credit Mayawati for her intellect when she spends hundreds of crores on statues and real estate? If the writer is truly sincere, he will make sure that Thirumavalavan participates in thought and ideology debates at the national level and ensure the breakdown of linguistic and cultural barriers. Naive generalisations and presumptions will not do. - Partho Chandra

***

It's without doubt that Thirumavalavan could have been one among the popular leaders of India if he had not been boxed as a Dalit leader. As the author rightly pointed out, if any one excels in their profession, Indians by and large want to know the religion and caste to which they belong. If it turns out that the successful individual is from a marginalised community, people would rather ignore or limit their talents.

It is because of the sheer prejudice ingrained in the minds of the privileged. It is ridiculous and there is no rationale for such attitudes. If we want to become stronger and at the forefront along with developed countries, we need to appreciate and accommodate the talents and intellectuals of our country irrespective of religion and caste. I am proud to hail from an underprivileged group! - Arumugam Kaliaperumal

Instead of celebrating pseudo-science and making its perpetrators look like victims at the hands of the educated, I hope you'll find it in your heart to actually contribute to the progress of society and not regress (""One man's long, lonely mission to convince Kolkata that the Sun revolves around the Earth""s). A mentally imbalanced Class 8 dropout grappling for attention is what you choose to focus on? The whole article pretends like it isn't 2018 and that his claims actually have some substance.

The earth is a dead star? The energy produced from a star is only possible through nuclear fission reactions and chain reactions are bound to make all matter collapse into itself, which is how black holes are born. A dead star can have no matter, let alone a thriving biodiversity. If the sun were to rotate around the earth, the earth's gravitation would have to be strong enough to hold the sun, a celestial object larger than 10^5 times of itself. As impossible as that is, even if it were true, every cell of every bone of our body would have been crushed into the earth's core if it were to have such a high gravitional pull. It is utter garbage.

Sorry, we have better things to do than argue with obstinate morons. I am a National Institute of Technology student and I do not care for nonsense. But I care for what we celebrate.

The scientific spirit of inquiry is precious and that's what reflects in the polite reply from NASA to KC Paul. However, it is important to understand that baseless opinions do not become valuable just because someone holds them for very long. The standards that were used in selecting Paul as a worthy subject for a film are of no consequence to me, but for Scroll.in to cover him has come as a bizarre surprise. Are you going to follow it up with covering people who have held a lifelong commitment to other baseless beliefs and superstitions?

It is hard to digest that the main downside of being a fool is the possibility of becoming less of a fool someday; because if we continue to be incorrigible fools we may get movies made on our lives, and much more problematically, some day a prestigious news organisation like Scroll.in may cover us. - Satyam Dheeraj

I am a third-generation Christian, the granddaughter of an indigenous missionary, and I strongly disagree with the article by Nate Rabe (""I was raised in a missionary family but only have disgust and anger for Chau's actions in Andamans"").

When the white men came we were half-naked tribesmen. Superstition dominated our lives, living to appease the spirits for good harvests and for health. We head-hunted the enemy for sport. Our only concern was to have our barrel of alcohol full and tobacco to smoke.

Prior to the white man came the Vaishnavite missionaries to the nearby valley people and converted them. They named us untouchables and left us to our vices. Two centuries later, the white man came to us. He gave us education and liberated us from superstition. He gave us our script; albeit the English alphabet modified according to our dialect phonetics, thus saving our language from extinction. The white men put an end to our ""corrupt"" tradition.

To a privileged human tired of the evils of colonialism, the mundane tribal life is paradise. But as a tribal I am forever indebted to the white man for imposing his ""superior"" culture. Life was not this easy, we were an oppressed people.

Most importantly, Indian society as a whole owes a lot to the now demonised Christian missionaries. It must never be forgotten that it was the Christian missionaries and their burden to ""civilise"" the lesser cultures that led to the establishment of blind schools, shelters for widows and lepers. It was through mission schools that education, which was a privilege held only by the upper castes, became accessible to the lower castes. It was their education that enlightened and gave voice to Dalits and women in a society that accepted the oppression of certain sections of the society in the name of culture. - Shinobi Suantak"

Arun is accused of violating the rules for appointing primary teachers at panchayat and block level government schools.

The inquiry was ordered on December 21 by director of primary education Arvind Kumar Verma. ""Some irregularities were found in the selection process of teachers between 2006 and 2017. He has been given 15-day time to reply to the education department,"" he said.

Arvind told this newspaper on Saturday if Arun failed to come up with satisfactory reply, stern action will be taken against him.

The inquiry was initiated on a complaint from Gopalganj's district education officer (DEO) and district programme officer (establishment). In their letters to the department in August, the DEO and DPO alleged that Arun had committed large-scale bungling in teachers' selection.

According to education department officials, Arun appointed around 100 teachers at panchayat and block level in government primary schools of Gopalganj district without following the criteria of recruitment prescribed by the department.

""In case of any vacancy in government primary school after a teacher retired or died, Arun made appointments on the basis of a merit list issued in 2006 and 2008, without inviting fresh applications.

Government think-tank NITI Aayog has pitched for enactment of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, observing that regulatory bodies the Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India have ""failed"" to ensure adequate availability and quality of health professionals.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses. The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas. Medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Pointing to the severe shortages in the category of allied health professionals (AHPs) including medical lab technicians, optometrists and radiologists, the Aayog has sought the establishment of a Council to ensure standardization of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods and workforce management.

It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

As far as specialists are concerned, the Aayog observed that a large number of posts are vacant all over the country. According to estimates, India needs close to five lakh additional specialists, the report highlighted. There is also an acute shortage of medical faculty.

Of the 1,830 faculty posts across six All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), approximately 583 (31 per cent) had been filled up until July 2017, the Aayog pointed out. According to the report, as of March 2017, there were 10.23 lakh allopathic doctors registered with the MCI or state medical councils.

Assuming 80 per cent availability, the Aayog estimated that around 8.18 lakh doctors may actually be available for active service. This gives a doctor population ratio of 1:1613 against the WHO norm of 1:1000, it said. The current nurse-population ratio is 1:588.

""Due to the suboptimal quality of training offered by several institutions that have mushroomed over the years, limited career prospects and poor working conditions, especially in the private sector, there is a significant shortage of skilled nurses in the country,"" the Aayog stated.

""Private practice by medial faculty in teaching institutions is rampant in several states, compromising on the commitment to teaching and institutional clinical work,"" it highlighted. Among the constraints the Aayog mentioned were poor infrastructure in many state and private medical/nursing/dental colleges.

It further said that health professionals in the public sector are inadequately compensated and motivation levels are extremely poor.Fair compensation in the private sector, for nurses, is also a challenge. The Aayog has suggested creating a cadre of primary healthcare practitioners by introducing a three-year competency-based dynamic course for primary, community and family medicine and partner with private hospitals or private medical practitioners to skill technicians, nursing and para-nursing as well as para-medical staff to deal with paucity of health professionals."

Medical and nursing colleges are concentrated in a few states like Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra.

Pointing to the severe shortages in the category of allied health professionals (AHPs) including medical lab technicians, optometrists and radiologists, the Aayog has sought establishment of a Council to ensure standardization of education and putting in place quality control mechanisms for educational institutions, teaching methods and workforce management. It suggested putting in place an updated curriculum for medical and allied professions that keeps pace with the changing dynamics of public health, policy and demographics.

As far as specialists are concerned, the Aayog observed that a large number of posts are vacant all over the country. According to estimates, India needs close to five lakh additional specialists, the report highlighted. There is also an acute shortage of medical faculty. Of the 1,830 faculty posts across six All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), approximately 583 (31 per cent) had been filled up until July 2017, the Aayog pointed out.

According to the report, as of March 2017, there were 10.23 lakh allopathic doctors registered with the MCI or state medical councils. Assuming 80 per cent availability, the Aayog estimated that around 8.18 lakh doctors may actually be available for active service. This gives a doctor population ratio of 1:1613 against the WHO norm of 1:1000, it said. The current nurse-population ratio is 1:588.

""Due to the suboptimal quality of training offered by several institutions that have mushroomed over the years, limited career prospects and poor working conditions, especially in the private sector, there is a significant shortage of skilled nurses in the country,"" the Aayog stated.

The need for the bill arose due to failure of Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India to ensure availability and quality of health professionals.

New Delhi: Government think-tank NITI Aayog has pitched for enactment of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill, 2017, observing that regulatory bodies the Medical Council of India and the Nursing Council of India have ""failed"" to ensure adequate availability and quality of health professionals.

In its 'Strategy for New India @75' document released on Wednesday, the Aayog has recommended revamp of the regulatory system of nursing education to ensure quality training in nursing schools and also stressed on developing centres of excellence in nursing and enhancing the stature of government nurses.

The Aayog said the quality of health professional training and adherence to standards is sub-optimal, including in the private sector.

To address the shortage of doctors in the country, the Aayog has suggested creating conditions to facilitate import of doctors, especially those of Indian origin working abroad, and also deploying teachers from universities abroad as visiting professors at AIIMS or NIEs while linking at least 40 per cent of district hospitals with medical colleges.

It also suggested developing framework for deployment of doctors and specialists from the private sector to government hospitals on a visiting or honorary basis and expanding the system of Diplomate of National Board (DNB) and Diplomas from College of Physicians and Surgeons (CPS).

""Workforce shortages and uneven distribution of doctors, nurses, specialists and allied health professionals plague the sector,"" the Aayog said while observing that urban areas have four times as many doctors and three times as many nurses as compared to rural areas.

Despite a government rule against personal interviews with children during pre-primary admissions, many schools across the city continue with the process, activists working for educational reforms said.

Vijay Kanojia, a parent said, ""My children, who are twins, were interviewed in one of the schools for admission to the pre-primary section. On one hand, we instruct them to not speak to strangers or accept gifts or chocolates from unknown people and on the other hand, schools take them into separate rooms to interact. Kids, who follow parental guidance, might not perform well. Some kids may speak but, some may not. Despite a government ban on such a practice, schools keep on violating the norms.""

My daughter was ill and yet, was locked up in a room with four strangers. I asked in the e-mail, if they were teachers. They lured her in with the promise of chocolate. This was surprising because, no where did the notice mention that we were to bring our child along after applying for admission. No where did it say there would be an interview for a baby. We heard her wailing through the door, but the staff at the door chose to ignore our concern. This went on for the longest two minutes of our lives. My daughter is two years and four months old. She was sent out later, unceremoniously, like a play thing; and the door was shut again. So, I did a little research and asked my peers if I overreacted. I asked three mothers of school going children if this is the norm in this city. All three of them answered in the negative. I then decided to tell the principal that what they had done was not okay. There was no empathy for my daughter's distress.""

A look at the organisations working to ensure zero food wastage in India","The Financial Express",FALSE,"In a country where around 196 million people remain undernourished, the issue of food wastage is a grave one. But there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

According to the United Nations Development Programme, up to 40% of the food produced in India is wasted every year. Reportedly, the quantum of food that Indians waste in any given year is equivalent to the amount of food the UK consumes. These figures are all the more shocking for a nation where millions go hungry every day and many more are undernourished. Food wastage occurs at two stages -- primary and secondary. The primary stage includes wastage of grains and uncooked food, while the secondary stage encompasses throwing away cooked food prepared at mass gatherings, restaurants, households, weddings, etc. Last year, the government's Comptroller and Auditor General found that 4.7 lakh tonnes of wheat -- valued at '700 crore and meant to be distributed among the poor via the public distribution system -- was wasted in Punjab in 2015-16 due to lack of storage facilities. ""Our biggest problem is that we don't know how to manage the glut. I was looking at how the US deals with its surplus. In the past, the US government has bought surplus tomatoes and strawberries from farmers and distributed them in schools. Has that ever happened in our country? Why can't we move our surplus onion/potato production to schools? There has to be a mechanism to facilitate that kind of transfer which is missing,"" says Chandigarh-based agricultural expert Devinder Sharma.

This symbolises a deep problem in a country, where at least 195.9 million people remain undernourished, as per the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation's report titled State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2018. For a developing nation that ranked 100 out of 119 countries on the 2017 Global Hunger Index, the problem of food wastage is one that requires urgent attention. According to a report this year by Boston Consulting Group, by 2030, the annual food loss and waste in the world would hit 2.1 billion tonnes, a staggering increase from the current 1.6 billion tonnes. That wastage would be worth $1.5 trillion against the backdrop of rising inflation, the report adds. ""Food loss and waste are projected to increase in most regions around the world, with a significant spike in Asia in particular,"" the report adds. While the above figures paint a rather grim picture of the world, and specifically India, there is hope in the form of a few startups and organisations that are working towards ensuring a 'no-food-waste' future for the country.

Tech to the rescue

Since the past couple of years, scientists have been working on ways to prevent food wastage. A key, and often ignored, facet contributing to the issue of food wastage is lack of optimum packaging material. Researchers from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, US, have, however, taken a step towards solving that problem by developing 'super slippery' packaging -- it basically enables consumers to squeeze out every last drop of a food product from the package, reducing food wastage, according to a study published this year. ""Small amounts of sticky foods like condiments, dairy products, beverages and some meat products that remain trapped in their packaging can add up to big numbers over time even for a single household,"" the study notes. The hydrocarbon-based polymers used in the packaging are not only very slippery, but also self-cleaning, the study adds.

In addition to scientists, entrepreneurs, too, have invaded the space, developing applications and websites to help restaurants manage their surplus food by making it readily available to those in need. One such initiative has been undertaken by Pune-based Sanjeev Neve, who, in 2016, launched Food Dosti app, a comprehensive zero-food-wastage platform that brings together eateries, customers and non-profits. The app provides partner restaurants a platform to 'publish' information on the surplus food they have. NGOs and non-profit organisations that have signed up get notifications and can then collect the surplus food, depending on their need. The Food Dosti network has partnered with most restaurants in Pune, its base city, and has now also expanded operations to Mumbai, Neve says. Besides, Food Dosti also rewards customers who visit partner restaurants by giving cashback whenever they finish everything that they order. I t also gives customers the option to order partial portions of food to reduce wastage and lets them order the remaining portion free of cost on their next visit to any partner restaurant.

""We are told all our life that we shouldn't waste food, but there is no incentive given for it. So we thought that if we incentivise people for not wasting food, that may attract more active action or cooperation from them,"" says Neve. In the next eight-10 years, he plans to partner with 200 restaurants in each city across the country. According to Neve, the issue of food wastage originates from 'lack of respect' and 'problem of plenty.' ""Food is not respected that much as it is available easily to people with means... if we go a little deeper, it's a problem of plenty,"" says Neve, adding that the government should guide farmers on what proportion of which crop to grow, so that we only have required proportions of everything and massive quantities are not lost in transit.

Community effort

Individuals and communities across the country, too, are working towards bringing about change. Minu Pauline, the owner of Kochi-based Pappadavada restaurant, set up a community fridge in 2016, the first in the country, outside the restaurant premises to provide people a medium to donate. Taking cue, Gurugram-based Rahul Khera, too, installed a refrigerator outside his society last year in Sector 54 with the help of other residents. ""After our initiative, nearly five such societies in Delhi-NCR also installed a refrigerator outside their societies,"" says Khera, an IT professional.

Many first-generation entrepreneurs are also setting up volunteer-led organisations to transport excess food to places and people in dearth. Delhi-based non-profit Feeding India is one such organisation that began operations in April 2014 to work towards the ""cause of hunger and food wastage"". The organisation has partnered with around 3,800 shelter homes across the country where it provides food as an incentive to assist people to get out of the poverty cycle. ""We give food to people in shelter homes as an incentive to come to school or a skill development centre... the aim is to not make them dependent on us giving them food... that way, they won't work... the food is given so that these people get out of the poverty cycle eventually,"" says Srishti Jain, co-founder, Feeding India.

Robin Hood Army, a volunteer-based organisation, is another frontrunner in this domain, helping surplus food reach the needy with the help of volunteers whom it calls 'robins'. While Feeding India is present in 65 cities across the country, Robin Hood Army has its presence in over 80 cities globally. Conceived and conceptualised in 2014 by Neel Ghose, Robin Hood Army has tie-ups with restaurants in cities it is operational in. Ghose was inspired by Portugal's Re-Food Program that has volunteers collecting surplus food from restaurants and distributing it among the needy. Similarly, the 'robins' collect food from the food partners and serve it at shelter homes, bastis, to people living under flyovers, outside hospitals, etc. ""Our mission is simple: eradicate food wastage and world hunger,"" says Aarushi Batra, co-founder, Robin Hood Army.

Another interesting initiative has been taken up by the dabbawallas of Mumbai who are famous the world over for delivering tiffins to around two lakh people daily for the past 125 years. In December 2015, the dabbawallas took up the cause of feeding the needy. Under their 'Roti Bank' initiative, the dabbawallas collect surplus and leftover food from weddings, etc, and give it to the hungry and homeless in Mumbai, feeding roughly 150-200 people everyday.

Not just community organisations, hospitality leaders are also working for the cause. From installing water recycling plants to waste converters, they are doing their bit too. In June 2016, ITC Maurya in Delhi set up an on-site waste recycling plant -- Bio-Urja -- which uses leftover food and minimal water to operate. ""Leftover food from the banquet is used in the plant, which is installed on the hotel premises. The gas from it is used in the employee cafeteria as cooking fuel. Soon, it will be a chain-wide initiative,"" says Manisha Bhasin, senior executive chef, ITC Maurya, Delhi.

Changing mindsets

One of the biggest hurdles, however, that organisations like Feeding India and Robin Hood Army admit to facing while setting up base is to convince restaurants and people to come onboard. ""In India, there is this stigma associated with jhootha khaana (leftover food)... no one wants to donate that,"" says Jain of Feeding India. That, and the problem of lack of awareness, were the biggest hurdles, she says. ""Initially, we faced a lot of problems in convincing people to donate food. There were many big corporates that had excess food and yet were reluctant to donate... now, people have become more aware,"" Jain adds. Batra of Robin Hood Army agrees: ""They (restaurants) weren't sure where the food was going and it took a little bit of convincing and showing them pictures and selfies we took during our drives,"" she adds.

Another challenge they continue to face is the perishable nature of food, especially cooked food that has a higher tendency to turn bad, and hence must be distributed and consumed in a certain time frame. Neve of Food Dosti app has, however, devised a way out. ""We have a contractual obligation with NGOs that whenever they collect food, they must upcycle it within two hours. We also have contracts with restaurants that whatever food they give must stay good for at least six hours,"" he says. ""That gives us enough time to ensure that whatever food is donated is always in a good condition. Also, the non-profit organisations collect food if and only if they have someone to feed right then,"" he adds.

Feeding India, on the other hand, works with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to ensure that the food received is fit to be distributed. Even with all the challenges, however, these organisations are going full steam ahead. And they don't just distribute food, they also work towards educating and empowering those at risk. Feeding India, for one, runs a 'Poshan to Paathshala' initiative under which it provides nutritious meals to children during school hours across India, thereby incentivising their attendance at school. They also run awareness workshops, mentoring sessions and computer classes across India for the holistic development of children.

Robin Hood Army, too, started Robin Hood Academy, which provides basic primary education to children it serves food to, in 2016. ""We piloted it in one city and expanded our scope to not just educating, but also facilitating admission for these kids in government schools. The idea went down extremely well with other RHA (Robin Hood Army) cities and now we have academies in over 23 cities with 500-plus kids having been admitted into schools,"" says Batra. They also help the poor get Aadhaar cards and also organise health camps, providing the poor health checkups.

Problem at procurement level

While all these organisations and initiatives are tirelessly trying to curb the food wastage menace in India, one glaring issue that remains largely unchecked is the post-harvest loss of grains. Year-after-year, a large amount of post-harvest produce gets 'ruined' prior to distribution due to lack of proper infrastructure. The Food Corporation of India, the central agency assigned the task of procuring foodgrains from farmers at minimum support price for distribution under the PDS system, has, in fact, faced massive criticism for wastage, misappropriation and fraudulent payments over the years.

From 2012 to 2014, the annual value of harvest and post-harvest losses of India's major agricultural produce was estimated at '92,651 crore (at average annual prices of 2014), according to a 2015 study by the Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology (CIPHET), Ludhiana. Nearly 27% of the cereals -- including paddy, wheat, maize, bajra and sorghum -- were wasted following production (the value of loss stood at '20,698 crore). In the case of pulses, 29% of pigeon pea, chickpea, black gram and green gram (valued at '3,877 crore) were lost at the post-harvest stage. The estimated loss of oilseeds stood at nearly 33% of the total produce. Losses in fruits ranged from 6.7% in post-harvest produce of papaya to nearly 15.88% in guava produce. ""Considerable losses during storage in market channels showed the need for multi-crop storages. Cold chain is essential to reduce the losses of fruits,"" the CIPHET study noted. The study also reported that 7% of poultry meat (valued at '3,942 crore) was lost -- of this, about 60% was lost during storage.

""After the grains reach the mandi is when the real problem begins. Both the private and government sectors are responsible for the losses that occur at that stage,"" says agricultural expert Sharma. ""We have the Agricultural Produce Market Committee and its task is to provide a platform for farmers to sell their produce. If a farmer goes there and finds lack of storage facilities and the grains rotting already, who do we blame? There should be a proper policy in place, delegating duties to the government and private sectors, which has not happened in our country.""

In an August 2016 release, the ministry of food processing industries said it had implemented the schemes of mega food parks, integrated cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure and setting up/modernisation of abattoirs to curb losses in the supply chain. ""The mega food parks scheme aims to provide modern infrastructure for food processing units in the country on a pre-identified cluster basis,"" the release noted. ""Under the scheme, grant-in-aid is provided at the rate of 50% of the eligible project cost in general areas and 75% thereof in difficult areas and hilly areas, subject to a maximum of '50 crore per project,"" it added.

As of the other schemes, the aim of modernisation of abattoirs was to provide hygienic finished meat and its products to consumers. ""So far, 41 abattoir projects have been sanctioned,"" the release said. The objective of the cold chain, value addition and preservation infrastructure scheme is to arrest post-harvest losses of horticulture and non-horticulture produce and provide remunerative prices to farmers for their produce. ""The scheme is primarily private-sector-driven and proposals under this scheme are invited through expression of interest,"" the release said.

Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a recent interview, acknowledged the gravity of the issue of wastage of food grains in the country and called for international collaborations to help tackle it. In India, food gets wasted even before it reaches the plate, she said, as opposed to the West, where wastage occurs at the consumption stage. Earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, too, signed memorandums of understanding with Denmark (known for its sustainable food practices and reduced food wastage) in the fields of animal husbandry, food safety and agricultural research, with the aim of taking cues from that country and working on its flaws. Time will tell whether these efforts will bear fruit, but for now, a lot needs to be done on this front."

Or me. Most urbanites (I grew up in Bengaluru) have had some experience of Bharat-the other 69 per cent of Indians who live in the hinterland. I have vivid memories of visiting my maternal grandfather in Bhagamandala, in the foothills of Talacauvery in Kodagu where the mighty Cauvery bubbles forth as a tiny spring.

From 1965 onwards, I regularly went to Cherangala, his village, to stay with him while he was alive and to pay res­pects at his grave after he died. We had to go by foot to his house from the bus stop in Bhagamandala. It was a five kilometre walk through lush paddy fields bisected by the gurgling Cauvery, which was more of a stream than a river. The house did not have electricity and we lit kerosene lamps at night. Food was cooked using firewood-the akki (rice) rotis baked on them were delicious. We plucked cashew fruit from the garden, roasted the seeds on burning wood and ate the kernel piping hot. We bathed in a pond surrounded by a thatched enclosure. There were no toilets, we took refuge in the nearby bushes, always watching our backs for snakes and other wildlife. It was only in the early 2000s that change became visible in the village. We did not have to walk to the house any more, we could use the motorable road that passed right by it. Electricity poles had come up and, when the lights failed, the hum of gensets echoed across the hills. Houses with thatched roofs were replaced by ones using cement, concrete and tiles. When I last visited two years back, my relatives cooked food using LPG cylinders. The houses had attached toilets and bathrooms with water coming from the taps. Everyone had smartphones and stayed in touch on WhatsApp. They kept abreast of cashew, coffee and cardamom prices in India and the world on the internet. The issues they faced, though, were no different from what my grandfather complained about when he was alive. The price at which they sold the surplus paddy they grew remains unremunerative. Rates for coffee, the main plantation crop, continue to fluctuate widely even as finding labour to tend the plants has got costlier. Loss of tree cover and climate change are making agriculture a risky venture, forcing some members of the family to find work in town and supplement the family income.

Welcome to the New Bharat which, like Kodagu, has experienced transformational change along with extreme contradictions since india today magazine came into existence 43 years ago. Even as it prospered, the countryside experienced equal distress, particularly on the farm front. The paradoxes are evident. In these four decades, the Central and state governments have combined their resources to build a record 30 lakh kilometres of black top roads that now connect the 640,867 villages to the nearest town. By last year, virtually 100 per cent of India's villages had been electrified, and almost 83 per cent of rural households now have electric bulbs lighting up their nights. Under a scheme to provide housing for the needy in villages, 1 crore houses have been built in the past four years, a six-fold annual increase from before. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan has seen over 9 crore toilets being built since 2014 and 5.3 lakh villages have been declared open defecation free. With 5.8 crore new LPG connections given since 2016, cooking gas is fast replacing kerosene stoves and coal- or wood-fired chulhas in kitchens, covering almost 50 per cent of rural households. Mobile phone coverage and usage have reached the poorest of the poor. Joining the white revolution that saw India become the world's largest producer of milk are the silver (poultry) and blue (fisheries) revolutions. And the number of those living below the poverty line (BPL) in rural India has dropped dramatically, from 50 per cent in 1993-94 to 25.7 per cent today.

Yet, even if the transformation has been nothing short of revolutionary in many areas, on key welfare indicators such as health and education and on the economic front, the situation remains grim. While infant mortality levels have dropped significantly since Independence, they are still at a higher level than in neighbouring countries such as Bangladesh. Almost 35 per cent, or one out of three, children in villages still suffer from malnutrition. In education, while enrolment in primary and secondary levels is near universal, dropout rates for high school are extremely high and only 11.6 per cent pursue an undergraduate course. Even for those enrolled in schools, several studies have exposed how poor the standards of learning are. In agriculture, production levels have reached record levels in foodgrains and pulses, making India self-sufficient in food. But this has triggered a problem of plenty that has seen farmers across the country rise up in strong protest against the low returns. Farmer distress is compounded by the huge slowdown in manufacturing and industry in the country. That has resulted in not enough jobs being generated to absorb the underemployed from agriculture. Agricultural workers now constitute 54 per cent of India's total work force, but their productivity is only half that of their urban counterparts.

So, to paraphrase Charles Dickens, it is the best of times for village India and also the worst of times. Why do we still call it Naya Bharat when much of it could still be described as the old India with all its familiar woes? The big difference is that no more are those living in village India willing to resign themselves to their fate. Or depend on doles from the government to lift them out of the abyss. That change is visible, particularly among rural women, who are looking to go beyond being homemakers or work as subsistence farm labourers. In what is possibly the world's largest self-employed movement, over 10 crore women have formed 717,689 self-help groups (SHGs) and now collectively engage in a wide spectrum of economic activity that gives them income and, more importantly, an identity of their own. They organise themselves in clusters to leverage small loans from banks to fund the jobs they are engaged in, whether in livestock management or in tailoring. They have a strong record of repaying loans. And they are bringing about a silent but profound revolution.

All across the country, as India Today correspondents found, there are inspiring examples of how villagers have worked against debilitating odds to bring about change, not only in their lives but for others as well. Ruma Devi, who features on our front cover, got married at the age of 17 with few skills other than stitching and embroidery. To supplement her income, she formed a self-help group to make handicrafts. When its members found that rather than rely on middlemen, they could directly buy their raw material and sell their finished products, they took a bank loan and expanded their business. Ruma Devi then joined an NGO called Gramin Vikas Evam Chetna Sansthan that trained artisans and rose to become its president. It now operates in 75 villages and has trained over 11,000 artisans. Ruma Devi inspired her team members to diversify into making tops, skirts, dupattas and salwar suits using traditional motifs. Their work caught the attention of top designers who have started purchasing the clothes they make. At 30 years of age, Ruma Devi is an outstanding example of the success of empowered women. In the following pages, we feature many more such heart-warming stories.

The recent rising tide of farmers' protests is also an expression of rural self-assertion and awareness. Farmers are now demanding more than band-aid solutions like loan waivers that make them look like villains and benefit only those who can game the system. Their demand is for an INCOME REVOLUTION, not a green, blue or white one. They are not taken in by the promises from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double farm incomes. They insist on speedy delivery and fundamental reform. They also want ""ease of doing agriculture"" rather than just seeing all the government's concessions go to industry. This tragedy could have been averted if agricultural practices had also seen a paradigm shift with the economic reform process that began in 1991. It didn't happen. Policy-makers continued with the single-minded focus on production and self-sufficiency. They were averse to taking major risks for fear of offending India's largest vote bank. In contrast, China ushered in major reform so that only 18 per cent of its population now is dependent on agriculture as compared to India's 43 per cent.

Among India's follies was the failure to amend the various land acts. As a result, the fragmentation of land holdings has reached critical levels, with a majority of farmers working less than one hectare of land. With no enabling legislation being passed towards easing the land crisis, contract farming, innovative technologies and economies of scale have not taken hold. What was also neglected was agricultural logistics, post-production processing and marketing of products. For instance, the shortfall in cold-chain infrastructure for storage and transport of high-value crops such as fruits and vegetables is anything between 85 and 95 per cent. There were other mistakes. There is a clear need to link agriculture to domestic and industrial consumption and diversify crops based on need. But the mindless focus on foodgrains saw close to 50 million tonnes being stored under the Public Distribution System-more than twice the ann­ual food entitlement of all the BPL families in the country. To cite another example, we need only 25 million tonnes of sugarcane for domestic consumption, but we produce 30-36 million tonnes. Yet, till July this year, government policy restricted its diversion to non-food uses like ethanol production. No matter which party comes to power in 2019, one must hope its manifesto will include undertaking major agrarian reforms to end the farmers' agony.

In the other key areas impacting rural progress, both the Central and state governments have thankfully learnt from past errors. Providing rural housing for the needy is one such. Housing programmes have been around since 1985, but their implementation has been tardy, and corruption rampant. When the NDA government under Narendra Modi came to power, it rev­am­ped the programme and ren­amed it the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana. The size of the houses to be built was increased from 20 square metres to 25 square metres and the grant increased from Rs 70,000 to Rs 1.2 lakh. But what was critical was how corruption was curbed using digital and communications technology. At the time of the payment of the first instalment, the recipient has to upload his photograph along with pictures of the plot of land his house is to come up on. Then, the person has to send photographs of each major stage of construction stipulated to get the next instalment. The subsidy money is transferred directly to the recipient's bank account, ensuring it is not diverted. This has cut down corruption by local officials from 50 per cent to around 12 per cent. It has also seen a record number of houses being built in the past four years. One fallout: with no slush money coming to them, many of the panchayat-level officials are not pushing the programme too enthusiastically.

Another welcome development has been the move to integrate the various services under diff­erent schemes. So, under the housing scheme, a person can also avail of the subsidy for toilets under Swachh Bharat, get a cooking gas connection under the PM Ujjwala Yojana and an electricity connection under the rural electrification programme. With all money transfers going to bank accounts, the opportunities for corrupt officials to withhold or divert payments has been dramatically reduced. It remains critical to ensure that, having provided these amenities, the quality of service is not compromised. It is not enough to bring electricity poles to a village, there must also be quality supply of power. In subsidised LPG, cooking refills have to be made easily available and not given as a premium.

In the PM Gram Sadak Yojana, an important innovation is that, apart from building the roads, there is a built-in five-year maintenance contract the constructor has to abide by. He has no choice then but to ensure that good quality material is used for making the road. Some of the other government schemes have provided amazing results in the past too. When M.G. Ramachandran was chief minister of Tamil Nadu in 1982, he introduced the mid-day meal scheme. I had written an article about it for the magazine at the time, dismissing it as a populist scheme. But its impact turned out to be revolutionary. Infant mortality rates in the state began to drop significantly a few years after the scheme was introduced. Then the government cleverly extended it to pregnant mothers who came to drop their children to school. They were not only given a meal package but also medicines to ensure a safe pregnancy. It was followed up with post-natal care and benefits. That saw maternal mortality rates drop perceptibly in the state. And to the astonishment of social planners, Tamil Nadu's total fertility rates began to fall significantly within a decade, reaching levels only achieved by Kerala.

Maternal care has been another success story. When I visited Rajasthan in the 1980s for a health story, only two out of 10 babies born were institutional deliveries. The other eight were delivered at home with the help of the rudimentary equipment used by traditional midwives or dais. Today, eight out of 10 babies in Rajasthan are born under institutional care.

Yet, while these are laudable success stories, it is not enough for governments to be content with providing the basics alone. In the mid-1980s, the then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, launched the rural water mission. The government improved the quality of the hand-pumps being installed and had them mass produced. It then made provisions for speedy boring of wells and installation of pumps. There were still issues as to how many wells had to be sunk in each village, including separate ones for Dalits and Muslims. But it transformed water availability in rural areas where women had to walk long distances to fetch water. I travelled across several states during the great drought of 1987 and found that the hand pumps provided major relief and enabled the Rajiv government to successfully tackle the crisis. While villagers then were willing to gather around hand-pumps to collect water, now they are all clamouring for piped water supply to their homes, having seen their urban counterparts enjoy such facilities. Yet, this is not going to be easy to deliver both in terms of costs and availability. The situation calls for innovative solutions and people's involvement and cooperation to accept and implement them.

There were good reasons why my parents left their respective villages in Kodagu to work for a living in professions other than agriculture. Reasons that continue to send droves of migrants from villages in search of jobs to urban India. For the new Bharat to prosper, there will have to be major reforms in every aspect of the lives of the 83.3 crore who live in it. That remains India's biggest challenge."

Furthermore soon after the incident was reported, several children in Classes 2, 3 and 4 began to vomit.

Immediately they were rushed to the local Primary Health Centre where they were treated for food poisoning. Accordingly Karnataka Food Commission had stated that Akshaya Patra's food was bland and monotonous as they did not use onion and garlic in the meals. Reportedly this had led to children not eating the food and the commission had also noted that Akshaya Patra was not providing an adequate quantity of food as prescribed by the Karnataka government.

Earlier on Wednesday, the state food commission had met with representatives of Akshaya Patra in Bengaluru. Krishnamurthy, the Chairman of the Food Commission said ""Akshaya Patra representatives said that they would find nutritional replacements for onion and garlic.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Each year on the 22 December, schools and educational institutes around the country observe and celebrate National Mathematics Day.

And while not everyone feels the need to celebrate mathematics, the day is observed not to honour the field as a whole, but a very special Indian mathematician whose trust with mathematics has inspired books, art and our tradition to commemorate the genius of Srinivasa Ramanujan on 22 December each year - his birth anniversary - as National Mathematics Day.

Born in 1887 in the charming city of Erode, Tamil Nadu, Ramanujan's earliest stories begin around the age of 12. He had mastered the dizzying logic of trigonometry and developed theorems on his own without any assistance.

His passion for mathematics and the brilliance of the world it translated to at an early age.

The wiz kid

Turning 10 years old in 1897, he aced his primary school exams in English, Tamil, geography and arithmetic with the best scores in his district. Ramanujan entered Town Higher Secondary School that year, where he encountered formal mathematics for the first time.

By age 11, he had exhausted the mathematical knowledge of two college students lodging at his home, and was lent a book on advanced trigonometry around the same time. He mastered this by age 13, by which time he was discovering sophisticated theorems on his own.

Ramanujan at 14 was being lauded with merit certificates and academic awards in a trend that weaves through his entire school career, where he also assisted the school with logistics of placing 1200 students, each with needs of their own, under the tutelage of its 35-odd teachers.

He would complete mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and unwittingly brought on comments from his peers over the years, who ""rarely understood him"" and ""stood in respectful awe"" of him in the years since.

Awakening the genius

Ramanujan at age 16 in 1903 got access to a library copy of a book - A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics, a collection of 5,000 mathematical theorems, which he reportedly studied in great detail. This book is generally acknowledged by accounts of his life as a key element in awakening his genius.

Towards his schooling's end, this earned him a scholarship to study at the Government Arts College of Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu. His headmaster in school would introduce Ramanujan as ""the outstanding student who deserved scores higher than the maximum"". But he squandered the opportunity due to his horrendous performance in other important subjects, including English, philosophy and Sanskrit.

Without a formal degree, Ramanujan is said to have dropped out of college and pursued research in mathematics on his own, living in stark poverty, at the brink of starvation. It was in 1910 at age 23 that support from renowned mathematician Ramaswamy Iyer helped him scored a job clerking at the Madras Port Trust.

Cambridge calling

He would work at the office by day, and do what came naturally to him (theoretical mathematics, that is) in his spare time. British mathematician G Hardy wrote Ramanujan a letter in 1913, expressing interest in learning more about his work. It was ""essential that I should see proofs of some of your assertions"", he is said to have added.

Ramanujan responded to Hardy, who eventually became his mentor, on principles of mutual interest to them, saying:

""I beg to introduce myself to you as a clerk in the Accounts Department of the Port Trust Office at Madras... I have no University education but I have undergone the ordinary school course. After leaving school I have been employing the spare time at my disposal to work at Mathematics. I have not trodden through the conventional regular course which is followed in a University course, but I am striking out a new path for myself.""

G Hardy and Ramanujan ended up working together in Cambridge for five years shortly after their first correspondence. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures, beliefs, and working styles, but his work in Mathematics made a left a deep impression on Hardy for years to come. Hardy was quoted to have said about Ramanujan in a book:

""He could remember the idiosyncrasies of numbers in an almost uncanny way. It was Littlewood (a mutual colleague) who said that every positive integer was one of Ramanujan's personal friends. I remember once going to see him when he was ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an unfavorable omen. ""No,"" he replied, ""it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.""

A self-made luminary

Born to a housewife and a sari clerk, his family home in Kumbakonam was small and modest. The modest thatched-roof house on Saranhapani Sannidhi Street has been turned into a museum in his honour.

Ramanujan was a self-taught mathematician. He contributed inordinately to the world of mathematics, and was globally popular - one of the most influential mathematicians of his time. From compiling over 3900 mathematical theorems and equations to having discoveries and streets named after him, his assertions in mathematics were unshakeable and profound to others researching mathematics."

Even as admissions for pre-primary sections began in October, many schools in the city are not assuring promotion to selected children from senior kg to the 1st grade. As a result, aggrieved parents are running from one school to another to seek admission for their children.

A parent from South Mumbai said, ""Earlier, the school would give admission forms which the parents would take home to fill them up and submit the next day. But, now the schools are asking parents to fill the forms the same day in the school itself, and return them immediately. This is all because they don't want parents to click pictures of the admission forms and send it to the media to expose them. The schools are mentioning in the forms that there's no guarantee of a child getting promoted to class 1. When we went to one of the South Mumbai schools to fill the form, we saw read this and were very disappointed.""

This programme subsumes the three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). It is an overarching programme for the school education sector extending from pre-school to class XII and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels of school education. It envisages the 'school' as a continuum from pre-school, primary, upper primary, secondary to senior secondary levels. The States/UTs are assisted by the central government to implement the Samagra Shiksha as a programme for providing universal access and retention, bridging of gender and social category gaps in education and enhancement of learning level of children at all levels of school education.

The major interventions under the scheme are: (i) Universal Access including Infrastructure Development and Retention; (ii) Gender and Equity; (iii) Inclusive Education; (iv) Quality; (v) Financial support for Teacher Salary; (vi) Digital initiatives; (vii) Entitlements under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009 including uniforms, textbooks etc.;(viii) Pre-school Education; (ix) Vocational Education; (x) Sports and Physical Education; and (xi) Strengthening of Teacher Education and Training. The main emphasis of the Scheme is on improving quality of school education and the strategy of all interventions would be to enhance the Learning Outcomes at all levels of schooling.

The major features of Samagra Shiksha are as under:-

Preference for opening of new school is given to tribal areas, and areas with high concentration of Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and minority population. The districts with high concentration of population of SCs, STs and Muslims have been identified as Special Focus Districts (SFDs) for ensuring equity and inclusion at all levels of school education. Provisions have also been made for 1020 residential schools/hostels for children living in sparsely populated areas, children living in areas where schools cannot be opened due to unavailability of land and children in need of care and protection.

The RTE Act also provides for Special Training for age-appropriate admission of out-of-school children including children of disadvantaged groups in urban and rural areas. Approval has been given for special training of 8.08 lakh children with the financial outlay of Rs. 56353.95 lakh in 2018-19.

During 2018-19 an amount of Rs. 19668.26 crore has been released (as on 30.11.2018) to States/UTs as central share against the total Budget of Rs. 30891.81 crore for implementation of various interventions under Samagra Shiksha."

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students. These schools had an average of 1 or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four to five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools,"" he said.

The council said four-step process including field inspection, cross-district verification, block and district consultation and final notification to merge the schools.

Singh said 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools have been shifted and 96% students have expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty to shift 150 students due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue is resolved and 120 students were shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students with better teachers' availability and reduced the requirements of teachers by 4,500. Besides, the process saved government's Rs 400 crore through reduced teachers and infrastructure requirements, JEPC officials said.

Education Dept ropes in IIM Ranchi for merged school evaluation

State education secretary AP Singh said the department has roped in Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, for evaluation of the merged schools. The IIM, Ranchi would see if the reorganization process brought any difference in improving the education of students, who were shifted in merging process.

He said IIM Bangalore has also expressed willingness for a study of the reorganization process and its benefit."

Thereafter I'll write a TOI blog post on this topic.

Who are these economists?

Thirteen senior economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan, IMF Chief Economist Gita Gopinath and Sajjid Chinoy of JP Morgan. Others are: Abhijit Banerjee, Pranjul Bhandari, Maitreesh Ghatak, Amartya Lahiri, Neelkanth Mishra, Prachi Mishra, Karthik Muralidharan, Rohini Pande, Eswar Prasad and E. Somanathan.

Unfortunately, I've not heard of any of these economists apart from Raghuram Rajan and read none of them before. I read only the world's best economists (with Hayek and Friedman being my benchmark), and no Indian economist comes in that category. And given what these economists have produced in this report, I will not be reading their work anyway.

In this report, they're OK on labour reforms, ordinary on most issues and pretty hopeless on agriculture, education and healthcare. Most importantly, they have totally missed governance reforms although they repeatedly point out the massive failure of government in every field. A major blind spot these economists need to fix.

The Imperative for Strong, Equitable, and Sustainable Growth

India is one of the fastest growing large countries in the world, having grown at an average of almost 7 percent for the last 25 years. There have been many notable reforms over this period - most recently, the co-operative fiscal federalism that has brought the Goods and Services Tax into being, the enactment of the Indian Bankruptcy Code, and the dramatic dis-inflation of recent years, partly as a result of a move to an inflation targeting regime.

While commendable, we should not be satisfied with this. India is still one of the poorest countries in the G-20, and poor countries ought to grow faster because catch-up growth is easier. As important, the benefits of growth in India have been distributed extremely unequally, with top incomes rising much faster than the rest. [Sanjeev: The real issue remains extreme poverty] We have seen new environmental challenges, in the form of sharp increases in both local pollution levels and in CO2 emissions [Sanjeev: CO2 emissions are GOOD, not bad] that, if unchecked, threaten to stall or reverse progress. India is also not creating enough jobs: even though data on employment in India are both low quality and controversial, the recent news that 28 million applied for 90,000 low level railway jobs suggests we are not satisfying the demand for jobs.1 Unfortunately, we are not well-positioned to follow the export-led growth path that allowed many Asian countries to climb out of poverty. Despite abundant cheap labor, we are not part of many global supply chains. Even as global firms seek to diversify away from China so as to reduce political risk, India is rarely seen as an obvious alternative. [That's because socialism has messed up everything in India]

Given India's continental size, it need not follow the export-led path. It will, however, have to ensure that growth generates jobs and incomes across the skill spectrum, in the process

There are tremendous possibilities for reforms that will take us towards faster and more equitable growth, as this report will lay out. However, we have to allocate scarce resources carefully to make sure that there is enough investment in sectors such as infrastructure to create jobs. India's aggregate fiscal deficit (state plus center) is still close to 6.5 percent of GDP, higher than almost any in the G-20, and not significantly lower than levels that existed five years ago. However, our investment rate has fallen sharply in recent years. Despite that, our external financing requirement (as measured by the current account deficit) increased appreciably earlier this year, increasing vulnerability. Moreover, to the extent that India grows while being more reliant on domestic demand than were other Asian emerging markets, it needs a much greater focus on macroeconomic stability than they did. For all these reasons, it needs to prioritize government spending better, focusing on filling clear investment gaps and protecting the vulnerable. It also needs to increase revenues by making the tax system more progressive both in taxes levied as well as through more effective collection from rich non-payers, by bringing more people into the tax net, and by charging users for government services where appropriate.

A key factor in spurring growth will be reforms that alleviate ""supply side"" constraints on growth and job creation. We have to enable both the industrial sector as well as the service sector to operate at larger scale. This involves embracing highly overdue labor reforms including allowing for a rich menu of contracts with workers that allow for more possibilities than just permanent workers and short term contractual labor in firms [Agree]. Such additional contracting possibilities could give workers more job security, give firms the incentive to train and invest in their skilling, even while giving firms more reason to scale up. Similarly, cleaner title to land, as well as a land acquisition process that protects the seller while simplifying acquisition, will reduce the cost of developing land, a critical need if we are to create jobs [Agree, but these economists should ask why Indian governance system can't perform this most basic function]. A more predictable and better regulatory environment - which prunes redundant or unnecessary regulation, carefully sets regulations in new areas necessitated by our development, and enforces regulations effectively and impartially - will create a much better environment for business. We must also improve the capabilities as well as strengthen the independence of our regulatory institutions. [Agree, but why is India's governance in such a mess even today?]

Scale is also key for productivity growth which, in turn, is essential for India to expand its share of world exports. The ongoing reorientation of the United States away from dependence on China provides India with a great opportunity to position itself as a viable alternative for cheap sourcing of goods and parts. But this would require macro and industrial policy reforms of the kind just outlined that remove existing impediments to India becoming a valued partner in global supply chains. Rolling back the recent increases in import tariffs along with a renewed commitment to resisting protective policies would be a good way of signaling this goal. [Agree]

In outlining an economic agenda, we have to recognize government capacity is limited - the number of government employees is often low relative to the tasks they are assigned [Sanjeev: TOTALLY DISAGREE here. The issue is SHEER AND TOTAL INCOMPETENCE AND CORRUPTION]. This is often compounded by low staff motivation and relatedly high absenteeism, as well as inadequate training. Government takes on too much, while delivering too little. Yet for growth to be equitable, a must in our democracy, effective and well-targeted government engagement is essential. [Why are these economists not talking about governance reforms?]

One partial solution is more decentralization, with more powers and funding delegated to the states, and perhaps more importantly, within the states to municipalities and panchayats. It will allow for a much more dynamic decision-making process, resulting in government policies that are more sensitive to local conditions, as well as more local democratic control of officialdom. [This is fine in principle but totally fails to account for the fact that the SAME bureaucracy and political incentives will lead to the SAME outcome.]

The strategic use of technology has the potential to help here as long as we are careful not to make a fetish of technology, are mindful of the human dimension of transactions, and deploy technology with enough safeguards. Technology can make it easier to monitor flows of funds and uses of funding locally, allowing for more devolution of funding, something that has been proposed by previous Finance Commissions. More generally, effective use of technology can also help substitute for government manpower, increase the points of access to government services, help monitor service provision, and reduce leakage in the system.

The debate on whether the public sector should occupy areas that can be done by the private sector will no doubt continue, and there is an obvious case for exiting areas where the public sector contributes little while draining the exchequer and distorting competition. [Sanjeev: Why is government involved in ANY business at all? And this is not a specific recommendation: a motherhood statement] The government should also reconsider its interventions in areas where it adds noise and uncertainty - for instance, the constant fiddling with agricultural import tariffs, the unpredictable closures or opening of export and import windows, and the inability to procure agricultural commodities or release them effectively, does significantly more damage than good to agriculture. While actions are taken in the name of the farmer or the consumer, it is the middleman who often benefits. [Sanjeev: there's nothing wrong with the middleman benefiting in a competitive and open market. But the market is not open. This recommendation fails to recognise the huge blockages on agriculture sector trade.]

Moreover, even when the consumer benefits from high farm production and low agricultural prices, which also help contain inflation, the cost to the farmers can be significant. The case of pulses is revealing. In 2016-17 for example, India witnessed its highest ever domestic production - close to 23 million metric tonnes -- likely reflecting a combination of a normal monsoon after successive droughts and the farmer response to higher market prices and MSPs. This was sufficient to fully satisfy domestic demand. Despite that, India imported a hefty 6.6 million tonnes of pulses (almost a third of total domestic production) at zero import duty - leading to a massive domestic supply glut, and a sharp and sustained fall in pulse prices over the next two years which continues to this day, with prices currently 30% lower than their 2016 peaks.

In addition to getting the government out of areas it should not be in, there is an equally urgent task of strengthening the government in areas it does poorly or is virtually absent in - for instance, regulating and certifying educational or medical service providers, apprehending and successfully prosecuting economic offenders [What about non-economic??!!], or regulating haphazard development and environmental despoliation without blocking growth. [When even murderers like Modi can remain on the loose, then what hope of justice? This was the opportunity to talk about governance reforms.]

For growth to be equitable and sustained, we have to reform our education, skilling, healthcare, and welfare systems significantly. Our record on primary education is dismal, with only about half of the children in class five able to do math or reading at the second-grade level. Parents have responded by increasingly migrating to private schooling, but private schools are only slightly better than government schools, and in their current form will not solve the problem of low education quality. [This is a TERRIBLE comment to make - to downplay private enterprise, the only thing that is working in India for the POOR] It does not get better at higher grades -- our PISA scores were so low that we refused to participate again in that international benchmarking exercise. The poor quality of human capital may already be constraining growth (industry is increasingly concerned about the large and growing skill deficit), limits its inclusiveness and prompt a premature move to replace workers with machines.

Healthcare is another area of major concern. In particular, the public system has largely been abandoned by the patients seeking regular primary care. They prefer paying for private treatment even though many practitioners are unqualified and prescribe the wrong treatment in more than 70% of the cases. This is partly a consequence of the failure of the public sector -- public sector practitioners are often absent, and when present they put very little effort into treatment. It is unclear how the recent Ayushman Bharat insurance scheme, which is the main current effort to deal with healthcare issues, will address this issue. [Sanjeev: with the BLATANT failure of government staring in the face, where is the talk about governance reforms?]

This is especially a problem because dealing with the large growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the many, only partly-solved, child and maternal health issues, relies heavily on getting frontline providers to lead the charge. Similar concerns apply in the education sector. A failure to ensure high-quality education and health care provision means that a substantial proportion of our future labor force will grow up underequipped with skills needed in the labor market and suffering from the long term consequences of stunting and wasting. Much of the middle-aged population will be dealing with debilitating diseases that could have been prevented or controlled. This obviously limits the sustainability and the inclusiveness of growth.

The environment is, of course, a critical challenge to the continuation of our growth and to the extent to which growth translates into improved quality of life. Many of our cities are increasingly experiencing levels of pollution that border on the toxic. If we cannot manage the environment at our present level of development, greater growth will make matters far worse. [Sanjeev: once again, this points to severe government failure - but no mention of the need for governance reforms] The consequences of environmentally myopic policies are reflected, for example, in the rapidly falling water table in many parts of the country, which threatens the sustainability of our agriculture. Relatedly, climate change is already having very significant effects on productivity and the quality of lives in India and we need to be at the forefront of global efforts to combat it. [Sanjeev: this claim is, of course, CRAP]

That our current policies do not add up to an inclusive and sustainable growth agenda is reflected in growing agitation across our society. Agrarian unrest, and the constant demand for loan waivers, is now compounded by demands for some form of government support from sections of society that are nowhere near the poorest. This reflects Indians' growing anxiety about their future and that of their children in an increasingly winner-take-all society, where they often end up on the losing side. Our welfare schemes like the MGNREGA and Pradhan Mantri Gramin Awas Yojana are mostly directed towards the very poor (the one exception being the public distribution system), so they do not serve the purpose of protecting those outside that group. Without stronger, sustainable, and inclusive growth we simply do not have the resources to expand our welfare schemes significantly, [Sanjeev: BUT WHY SHOULD WELFARE BE EXPANDED?] but if we do generate that growth, not only will there be less demand for welfare but there will be more resources to service any demand.

The bottom line is that while we have performed creditably in the last 25 years across different administrations, we cannot be complacent about our economic challenges. They are mounting. We are a group of economists, each with different specializations and interests, who have come together to offer proposals for the way ahead. Some of us are based in India, some outside, but we are all closely engaged in, and concerned about, India's development. We do not belong to any party, nor are we from the government. We hope this non-partisan analysis of our situation, while not intended to be comprehensive, will help spur debate as India moves to elections. The rest of this note summarizes our proposals, and offers our consensus view on some of the key issues we face. We then append individual notes by members of the group, which offers more details of individual views and proposals. Each note reflects the view of the author(s) in their personal capacity, and does not necessarily represent the institution they are affiliated with.

Macroeconomic stability: a prerequisite to sustainable growth and job creation

India's economic history is replete with the same lesson: preserving and protecting macroeconomic stability is an essential prerequisite to strong and sustained growth. Every time macro stability has been traded off to boost growth, the economy has been pushed towards a crisis, the consequences of which have undermined the very growth that was the initial policy focus.

Ensuring macroeconomic stability has at least three elements to it: maintaining low and stable inflation, ensuring the consolidated fiscal deficit leaves enough space for private investment, and ensuring that the current account deficit is sustainable and can be financed largely through stable capital inflows, to help insulate the economy from sudden swings in global sentiment. High and variable inflation constitutes a regressive tax, with the poor bearing the biggest brunt, since their incomes are typically least indexed to inflation. It also dissuades foreign investors from investing in rupee assets. Similarly, large and unsustainable fiscal/external imbalances impart significant macroeconomic and financial market uncertainty, push up borrowing costs and risk premia in the economy and threaten financial stability. All this impedes private and public investment.

Fiscal consolidation to creating space for more investment

The economy has made significant progress in combating inflation in recent years. Over the last 4 years inflation has averaged just over 4% versus almost 10% in the previous five years, and household inflation expectations are getting progressively anchored. The same, however, cannot be said of the fiscal side.

While the center's fiscal deficit has been steadily brought down, the combined deficit of the states - even after adjusting for UDAY - has continued to widen in recent years and, thereby, largely undone the center's consolidation. Consequently, the consolidated fiscal deficit in 2017-18, stood above 6.5%, not very different from its levels five years ago. Our primary suggestions to make progress on this difficult issue:

De-risking the external sector

India's heavy dependence on oil imports often results in ""boom-bust"" cycles on the balance of payments when crude prices change. For example, the CAD narrowed to 0.7% of GDP in 2016-17 as crude prices fell and was then tracking close to 3% of GDP in 2018 when crude prices bounced back up. This resulted in a large balance of payments surplus in the first instance and a large deficit in the second. These sharp swings complicate monetary policy, as well as exchange rate and liquidity management, and create undue external and fiscal volatility (since oil prices also alter the fiscal math). We should:

Fixing the Stressed Sectors

Careful but quick policy reforms are needed for the sectors/areas that are stressed. These include agriculture, infrastructure (including power), exports and banking. There are common themes in any revival. Typically, we need to redeploy government effort in each of these sectors, focusing it on areas where it is truly needed to play an enabling role, while freeing the sector of excessive bureaucracy and intervention, which results in inadequate access to markets, distorted prices, and poor incentives. While the recent focus on improving India's ranking on the World Bank's Doing Business measures is commendable, we should guard against the temptation to focus on the specifics of the World Bank measures, while neglecting the broader impediments to producing in India. [Agreed] We now consider each of these sectors in more detail.

Agriculture & the rural economy

We need deep rooted transformation of agriculture, treating it not as a sector that has to be propped up through repeated sops, but as an engine of India's job creation and growth. For that, it is imperative that we thoroughly reform agricultural and land policies. In particular, a key source of agrarian distress in recent years has been that the terms-of-trade confronting farmers has turned progressively more adverse, partly as a result of policies to combat food inflation. While low inflation is desirable in itself, the impact on farmers also needs to be taken into account. A policy priority should be to reduce distortions in farm product prices as well as input prices. Another important enabler is technology, both in educating and informing farmers, as well as in opening access to markets. Some specific proposals include

Infrastructure

Accelerating the pace of the infrastructure build-out will help in a number of ways; it will create jobs in construction and new economic activity around the resulting roads, ports, airports, railways, and housing; it will promote inclusion as it connects interior rural areas to markets; it will make our exports (and import-competing manufacturing) more competitive as it reduces input costs such as land (as cheaper areas are connected) and power, as well as improves logistics and reduces transportation costs; it will open up India to both domestic and foreign tourism, which can be a tremendous source of semi- skilled jobs. This will require

Power

Despite having some of the largest reserves of coal, as well as having substantial unutilized power generation capacity, India is both short of coal as well as short of power. These are policy self-goals, arising from both the dominant presence of government in coal mining and power distribution as well as populist impulses in pricing. Nevertheless, our low base allows us to choose a path that is both more energy efficient as well as less polluting as we reform the system for the twenty first century. For this we need:

Exports

India's non-oil, non-gold current account has deteriorated by almost 3% of GDP in the last three years, suggesting an urgent need to improve the underlying competitiveness of the tradable sector. Boosting exports should be the lynchpin of that strategy. [Sanjeev: Any economist who says this is simply not a good economist. Refer to Kautilya, and the best economists who agree that IMPORTS are the key. Let consumption be the focus of economists, and exports are a minor subset of this production process.] The existing constraints in the export sector appear to be reflective of more general problems in manufacturing: low scale of production, low productivity, bureaucratic impediments, high cost of inputs like land and power. We have suggested ways to address these earlier. In addition,

Financial Sector

Given the non-performing asset (NPA) build up in the banking system, it is imperative we make the banking system more robust and well capitalized [Sanjeev: HOW? By taxpayer subsidy??], expand its capacity to extend credit, and improve incentives to lend to the most productive sectors. While the recent travails of the NBFCs are a matter of concern, some of their problems stem from an overly rapid expansion of their balance sheets as they grew to substitute for banks. Stability in the banking system will help spread stability to other parts of the financial system as, of course, will the reverse.

The main challenges for the banking sector are to improve governance, transparency, and incentives in the banking system. Key measures should include

The non-bank financial sector needs a strong banking system as well as deep equity and bond markets, supported by liquid secondary markets and a robust regulatory and legal infrastructure. Key priorities include:

Making growth inclusive and sustainable

A good job is often the most important form of inclusion. In addition, we need to help individuals obtain the human capabilities that will enable them to secure and hold that job, as well as protect those who cannot get jobs. Let us now turn to proposals on inclusion.

Education

The single greatest limitation of the Indian education system is its inability to deliver universal functional literacy and numeracy in primary school. Several studies show that students who fail to achieve basic skills by the end of class 3 learn very little in subsequent years even if they are enrolled in school. Our top education policy priority is therefore:

The Right to Education (RTE) Bill's input-based approach to education quality was unlikely to succeed given the extensive evidence that most school inputs are neither necessary nor sufficient for improving learning outcomes. RTE has led to an unnecessary and disruptive closure of several low-cost private schools that parents were choosing of their own accord. In many cases, even government schools are in violation of these input-based norms. We therefore recommend:

While improvement in schooling is a key building block to education, we cannot neglect either vocational training/skilling or college education. Both will be critical to providing our youth with the wherewithal for the jobs of the future. High quality research universities will be essential, both to train the teachers for our colleges as well as to fuel the innovation needed for the next stage of our growth. [Sanjeev: GET THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THESE]

Dealing with the skills shortage

There is wide recognition that the current models of publicly subsidized skilling are not performing very well even though skills are extremely scarce. What seems to work better is the skilling provided by private firms that are training their own labor force. However, under current laws, firms can employ workers for up to one year after which they either have to fire them or make them permanent. Since there are significant costs and inflexibilities in making workers permanent, many firms keep workers on short contracts and terminate them before they can become permanent. This state of affairs serves neither the firm, which has to hire new workers frequently and has no incentive to train them, nor the worker, who has no security of employment, and who is not trained. At the same time, since the government is often the only employer that offers secure jobs, young people spend their twenties applying for these jobs rather than working. However, these jobs are extremely expensive thanks partly to the munificence of the Pay Commissions and therefore there are too few of them. As a result, a cynic could argue that the government and the private sector lack manpower, while young people sit at home filling applications and preparing for tests. We propose that:

Women's labor force participation

There are clearly both supply-side issues-families not allowing women to work, women feeling disempowered -- and demand-side issues -- lack of women-friendly jobs in the private sector as well as discrimination. Some useful first steps here:

Healthcare

There is much to be done to reform the healthcare system in India. Increasingly, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer play a much bigger role, so healthcare needs to be reoriented to address these.

Environment

Even while business complains about the difficulty of getting environmental approvals, the quality of our environment leaves much to be desired and with climate change looming we should be thinking in terms of reaching peak emissions within the next decade or so and then sharply reducing them. For all of this we need to get more professional about the environment and climate change, as well as more transparent about the regulatory process.

Social Protection

India has more than 400 separate social protection schemes. A vast majority of them are funded at very low levels and do very little. However, they absorb some amount of bureaucratic capacity. And despite the wide variety of schemes available on paper, as the many protests make clear, people do not feel protected. In particular while MGNREGA provides some support for the rural landless, most other relatively poor people have only the PDS to fall back on. This is one reason that it is so difficult to remove any government scheme, however inefficient. There is a clear need to create a reliable pipeline for providing compensation for losers, as we move towards a more rational system of social protection. The Direct Benefits Transfer is a good starting point and building on it by being credible in compensating losers will be key. Specifically we suggest"

Even as auto-rickshaws crowd near the main entrance to pick up and drop students and parents, the security guards are never seen making any efforts to clear the spot.

Another major issue that the area faces during the peak hours is random parking of two- wheelers along both sides of the road. What adds to this is the absence of traffic cops near the school.

To inculcate the concept of banking and savings in children, a teacher in a primary school of Bareilly has set up a 'school bank' that is run by students and is meant to meet their stationery requirements during their stay on the campus.

To run this bank, students voluntarily contribute Rs 2 each while teachers also willingly make donations. There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

""This money is used in buying pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, few books and kept in a cupboard in the principal's room, which they call green counter.

But all these are things of past. Now, on a day when students don't bring their pencil box, they don't go home. Instead, they walk into the 'school bank' and are allowed to borrow the same at zero interest for a day, he said.

Due to availability of stock in the 'school bank', the students are able to continue with their studies without any hindrances. The class also does not get disturbed. However, while going home after the school gets over, they are required to deposit the same back in the 'school bank', which is managed by students, said the teacher.

One Nikhil, a Class 5 student, has been appointed as manager of the 'School Bank'. But a teacher will assist him. ""The school teacher explained the concept. Everybody was convinced that it will be of great help for everyone. After whatever little money we could raise, teachers opened their wallet and heart to bridge the deficit. The school bank is now doing wonders,"" said Nikhil.

The 'School Bank' follows simple rules. Students of any class may avail the facilities of this bank. If a student fails to bring any stationery, he is not required to go back home and bring it. He just has to go to the bank, make an entry of the borrowed item in the register and attend class.

In case a student misplaces the borrowed item, he is supposed to give it back to the bank within 30 days. ""But below poverty line students are exempt from this rule. Students will be allowed to borrow things twice a week and seven times a month so that they do not make borrowing a habit,"" said Rinki, a student of the school.

The 'school bank' manager will be appointed from a senior class at regular intervals. Candidates with good academic record will be considered for the job, said the teacher.

The basic education department has appreciated the initiative of the school, and if found feasible, the same can be replicated in other schools too, said an official.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

VAN DHAN YOJANA

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs has launched a game-changing initiative for tribal people - The Van Dhan Yojana, with the launch of the first Van Dhan Vikas Kendra at Bijapur by the Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi on 14th April, 2018. It aims to provide skill upgradation and capacity building training and setting up of primary processing and value addition facility.

As per the plan, TRIFED will facilitate establishment of MFP-led multi-purpose Van Dhan Vikas Kendras, a cluster of 10 SHGs comprising of 30 tribal MFP gatherers each, in the tribal areas. This initiative is aimed at mainstreaming the tribal community by promoting primary level value addition to MFP at grassroots level. Through this initiative, the share of tribals in the value chain of Non-Timber Forest Produce is expected to rise from the present 20% to around 60%. About 3000 such Van Dhan Kendras are proposed to be set up in two years in the forested Tribal Districts of the country. To begin with, this initiative is proposed to be taken up on priority in the 39 Districts with more than 50% tribal population and to then gradually be expanded to other Tribal Districts in India.The initiative aims to promote MFPs-centric livelihood development of tribal gatherers and artisans. MFP or what may be more aptly referred to as Non Timber Forest Produces (NTFPs) are the primary source of income and livelihood for about 5 crore tribal people in the country.

AADI MAHOTSAV

Ministry of Tribal Affairs organized a National Tribal Festival named as 'Aadi Mahotsava' from 16November, 2018 to 30 November, 2018 with the help of TRIFED to celebrate, cherish and promote the spirit of tribal craft, culture, cuisine and commerce at Delhi Haat, INA. This festival was inaugurated by Sh Jual Oram, Hon'ble Minister of Tribal Affairs.

NGO GRANTS

Implementation of Online application system ""NGO Grants Online Application & Tracking System"" (www.ngograntsmota.gov.in) activated for processing NGO proposals under the scheme of ""Grant-in-aid to Voluntary Organizations working for welfare of Scheduled Tribes"" has resulted in quicker information flow and smoother implementation of the scheme besides increasing the number of applications.

MINIMUM SUPPORT PRICE FOR MINOR FOREST PRODUCE

The scheme for 'Mechanism for Marketing of Minor Forest Produce (MFP) through Minimum Support Price (MSP) and development of Value Chain for MFP"" (known as MSP for MFPin short) was launched in the year 2013-14 and it then covered only ten MFP items and was applicable to the Schedule V States only. Subsequently, in October 2016 the extent and coverage of the scheme was increased by adding more MFP items and also rendering the scheme applicable country wide. The MSP of ten items that were originally incorporated into the scheme were further revised in November 2017. The issues of further expanding the list of MFP items as also further revising the MSP of the existing MFP items are being considered by the Ministry."

""I want to meet Karate Anna,"" the boy, who had heard about R S Sreenivasan, the school's dedicated karate teacher, says.

""We took only three students to Sri Lanka and came back with six medals -- five gold and one bronze,"" Sreenivasan tells me later.

The three students from the school -- M Aaris (class 2), A M Siddesh Hariharan and I Hari Govind, both from Class 4 -- participated in the 5th Open International Semi Contact Shotokan Karate Championship in Sri Lanka on October 6 and 7.

Some 1,500 students from Australia, Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan competed in the championship.

At another tournament in Aranthangi, Tamil Nadu, where all the five southern states participated, this school won the overall shield and was also the only government school to have won prizes.

It started in 2016 when the government of Tamil Nadu issued a notification that schools should have karate classes for girls so that they learnt self-defence.

""If we only trained the girls, there would never be enough students. Therefore I decided to train the boys, too,"" Karthikeyan recalls how the idea came about.

A Geetha, a teacher at the school, recommended Sreenivasan's name.

A day after the government circular was issued, Sreenivasan began training the school's students.

""We told the master that we would pay Rs 100 per student. He expected at least Rs 5,000 a month for two classes a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays between 4.30 pm to 5.30 pm,"" says Karthikeyan.

""These are poor students. Some pay and some don't. I pay the difference so that the Master is not disappointed,"" he adds.

IMAGE: Young students practise karate on the school grounds.

Arranging funds for the Sri Lankan tournament wasn't easy either.

But help poured in from all quarters.

""Whenever there is a small shortage of funds I pay from my pocket and if we need more I have a few friends that help out,"" says Sreenivasan.

Tamil Nadu Education Minister K A Sengottaiyan was so pleased to know that a government school was participating in an international tournament that he called the headmaster and asked what he could do to help.

The minister sponsored the air tickets to Sri Lanka and also requested government officials on the island to look after the kids.

""We were received at the airport and well looked after. We had a vehicle at our disposal. They had arranged for our stay with separate accommodation for the kids,"" says Karthikeyan.

WATCH R S Sreenivasan train the girl students at the Municipal Primary School in Zameen Pallavaram.

It's not always the funds that bother Karthikeyan.

Just when we are speaking, a lady comes in with her son, a student at the school.

""I asked you to come because he was supposed to be here at 6 am for a tournament but he didn't come,"" says Karthikeyan.

""He overslept,"" the mother answers.

""He will oversleep, he is a child, you should have woken him up. There were 30 students, you don't expect me to call everyone of them in the morning.""

""The tournament and travel fee was Rs 300. I can't ask the tournament organisers for a refund nor can I ask the transporter. I don't mind paying as long as he participates. He did not participate, but someone else could have and maybe even won the prize there. I didn't want him to win, but I definitely wanted him to participate. Next time, don't let him sleep,"" the teacher admonishes the parent.

Karate is not the only game the students excel at. They have won medals in chess too. The Thirumal Chess Academy, Mudichur, coaches the students for free.

""We offered to pay a nominal amount, but they refused,"" said the encouraging headmaster, who proudly displays the prizes his students have won in chess and karate.

""We also have carrom here, which I teach. It's free. After school they can play as long as they want,"" the headmaster adds.

WATCH: R S Sreenivasan trains the boys at the school.

Students at the school recently participated in the national karate tournament in Kanyakumari.

""What we really require is to participate in an international tournament in Malaysia and Singapore in May 2019. The cost per child will be Rs 75,000,"" says Karthikeyan. ""We are planning to send a dozen kids and a coach. We need about Rs 1,000,000 which we hope to get from our well-wishers.""

Students between 12-18 years are being selected for this program as it is in this age that their mind can be tapped and moulded towards wildlife conservation. The Pench Foundation is organizing this event while Satpuda Foundation is the primary educational partner.

The Pench Foundation is an entity that uses funds from various sources like the park tourism income for the development of buffer zone villages and its people.

School education department officials have begun the work on opening kindergarten classes in the middle schools in the district and they are expected to chalk out a blueprint at the earliest.

The state government had on Monday passed an order to introduce LKG and UKG classes in 2,381 anganwadi centres functioning in the government middle schools across the state and equip them with teaching aids.

School education department officials said the order would be implemented after taking the strength of each anganwadi centre into account.

""This is an initiative to provide primary education to prepare the children for Class 1. The district will have 122 middle schools with kindergarten sections and further details will be disclosed after a meeting with the members of Integrated Child Development Services.

ThePrint asks: Should Karnataka govt push for onion, garlic in midday meal or let ISKCON follow own plan?

H.D. Kumaraswamy

Chief Minister of Karnataka

Onions and garlic help maintain good health. So, the question I would like to raise is, why should it be a problem in adding it in the midday meals that are served to children in the state?

Let food experts and doctors also explain the benefits. Food experts should advise the government whether to use these ingredients. Karnataka government is seeking the opinions of dietitians, food scientists and others on the advantages and disadvantages of onion and garlic. Then the government will take a call on what has to be done and whether other ingredients can substitute onions and garlic.

Let there be a debate on this on a public platform with all the stakeholders involved and then arrive at a decision.

Naveena Neerada Dasa

Head of communications, ISKCON

ISKCON is committed to feeding hot nutritious meals as prescribed by the MHRD and the state government.

In the last 18 years, we have put all effort to ensure that every child gets a nutritious meal. A lot of investment has gone into the infrastructure for cooking and providing hot meals.

We ensure that meals are cooked in the most hygienic conditions and we spare no effort. Akshaya Patra always feels that feeding the hungry is not a business but our social responsibility. Governments across the state have appreciated our efforts to give the best to children.

Basavaraju R

Executive director, Grassroots Research and Advocacy Movement (GRAAM)

I would say that the government should not insist, but persuade ISKCON to include these ingredients.

We know that garlic and onions are good and many dieticians say that. ISKCON maintains a very high-quality standard, and so, the government has no other option in those five districts that they serve in.

On the other hand is they insisted, I think ISKCON may agree. They should also respect dietary habits.

Children do consume it, but it would also be extreme to say that ISKCON should be forced to serve egg or meat. It will be against their philosophy. It is better to leave this decision on whether these ingredients are a must to the food experts.

We could also look at if onions and garlic can be made in powder form and added later when the food reaches the venue.

Onion and garlic is not as much a source of nutrition, as it is a taste enhancer. If the government wants to take the decision of stopping ISKCON's good service, then it will also have to take up additional responsibilities of hygiene and nutrition. Teachers will be additionally burdened. That's not fair. We should see if dialogue works, if not, we should explore innovative options.

Rohini Swamy

Associate editor, ThePrint

The controversy over using onion and garlic in midday meals has seen enough debate, but the bigger question is whether those who are availing the service are satisfied or not.

The Karnataka government should seek opinion of those who are involved in the scheme to understand whether the meals really offer a balanced diet to children or not. While many diet specialists say that onion and garlic are just taste enhancers and can be compensated with other food ingredients, a scientific approach to this issue is needed.

Another important point to note is that Akshaya Patra has been maintaining high standards of food quality control. This has been one of the primary reasons why the government is hesitant in taking any action against the NGO. Nearly one lakh children are served food under the midday meal scheme daily by Akshaya Patra, and in the last 18 years, there have been no major complaints against the quality or quantity of the food served. Akshaya Patra maintains that they follow the standards set by the MHRD.

With political parties using this issue as a weapon on target each other, children should be caught in this crossfire.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

Also read: Karnataka civil society groups want govt to dump ISKCON NGO over onion-garlic row

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."

The study was released by Tamil Nadu State Palmyra Workers and Rural Artisans Union on Monday.

It was conducted among a sample of 396 migrant workers' families in 11 settlements in Kadaladi Block in Ramanathapuram. There are around 10,000 families that depend on palmyra tapping for a living in the block alone, the study said.

Out of 577 children studied, 397 could not go to school as they had dropped out to become child labourers, it said. That is, 69 per cent of children drop out of school to work. Palmyra workers, who have to cut the tip of the palmyra's inflorescence at least thrice a day to prevent drying of sap, live within the palm groves for easy access. ""We start slicing it by 1.30 am. Then we have to do it thrice. On an average, we work at least 15 hours a day,"" said Anthony Rayappan, an elderly palm worker.

He cannot live far from the grove in order start work that early.

Large palm groves are situated at about 10-20 km away from the nearest urban areas, often isolating them with little access to education and health care, said Arivahagan Rayan from the union.The study showed that a majority of the children, had to travel 10 to 20 kilometres to go to school.

According to the study, 80 per cent of children who go to Anganwadi, 53 per cent of children who go to primary schools, 67 per cent who go to middle schools, 73 per cent to high school and 77 per cent who go to higher secondary schools have to travel at least 10 km to reach their institutions.

""Public transport facilities are denied for these school going children as the main road is more than three km distance for 62 per cent of the children,"" the study said. The migratory population also faces a similar lack of access to health and other social facilities.

In order to alleviate their life and livelihood, the government must provide roads through vast palm groves and transport, urged members of the union, adding that schools must be constructed closer to their settlements in accordance with the Right to Education Act.

They also added that government must work pro actively to prevent child labour in the population."

""We have written to block education officers to ensure that the private agencies are selected in each village to demolish unsafe government school buildings and construct new ones.

As per the education department, there are 174 illegal schools in the Gautam Budh Nagar district. Over two lakh students study in these schools, that are housed in illegal buildings with no safety measures in place, officials said.

""After a 2017-18 survey, we identified 174 illegal schools in district. Most of them were shut down. Now, to identify more illegal schools, we have formed two teams that will submit monthly reports.

It's mid-August in Goa. The sand is damp beneath my feet as I walk along Candolim beach. The skies are grey and empty. And so is the land.

I finally spot one gentleman at a distance. He's armed with a stick and seems to be persuading strays to move along. He glares at me as I draw closer.

""Private beach area, sir,"" he says.

He proves to be the guard at the Taj Holiday Village and Spa resort, a touristy extravagance that brings thousands to Goa every year.

Once he loosens up, I ask about the empty beach and he says simply, ""Off-season."" I'm not convinced.

Where are the tourists, the backpackers and hippies, who legendarily swarm around Goa's beaches all year long?

A day later I meet someone who may be among the last of that generation. French-born Leo Cecil Michaud came to Goa as an 18 year old in 1992. ""There weren't any famous bars back then,"" says Michaud. ""The city was tripping on something entirely different."" He decided to stay.

In 2006, he opened a restaurant called Baba au Rhum, named after the French dessert, which retains a certain hippie charm. But Michaud says that almost 80 per cent of his guests are Indians, many of them recent immigrants to Goa from Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru.

Before I leave the restaurant, I try a new beer, the Susegado. A Goan cliche, the word is still a fitting name for a seasonal brew. The word has come to mean many things Goa.

Like the waters of the Arabian Sea, Indians have been hitting the shores of Goa regularly for years -- most holidayed and left; some returned to build holiday homes; and a handful stayed on to live and work and build a new life.

To the first wave of Indians who had come looking for a new home, susegado meant restfulness; a reprieve from India's rapidly expanding cities. These cities have now grown to bursting point.

After living in New Delhi for more than 10 years, artist Nityan Unnikrishnan decided he'd had enough. He moved to gentler Goa in April 2017, and waited for his wife, Rukminee Guha Thakurta, to overcome her apprehensiveness and make the move too.

""As a freelance design consultant, my work is entirely dependent on the Internet and staying connected,"" says Guha Thakurta. ""I told Nityan my living in Goa would depend on the Internet connectivity!"" She finally joined him in October 2017.

Nearly a year later, not only is Guha Thakurta still in Goa, she's as busy as ever. ""The Internet here is better than in Delhi,"" she laughs.

In her spare time -- and there's considerably more since she spends fewer hours on the road -- she's become a fond tender of fruit and vegetable plants on the multiple balconies of their sprawling first-floor apartment in Porvorim, sometimes gleefully sending pictures of dewy melons and dusky chillies to her city friends.

Guha Thakurta and Unnikrishnan are now looking for land where they hope to build a modest home of their dreams.

Noted photojournalist Prashant Panjiar and co-founder of the Nazar Foundation recently managed that particular feat, having built a 300 sq m modernistic house in Moira. He loves the fact that he can wear shorts almost everywhere. He says he's nowhere close to retiring.

""I am doing the same amount of work as I was in Delhi,"" says Panjiar, echoing Guha Thakurta. ""But I don't feel anxious.""

Caught in the frantic pace of city life, he says, people often feel like they are running out of time. ""Maybe I am relaxed because now I can see all the trees I want to see from my balcony.""

Not all fed-up city-dwellers have the luxury of taking the radical decision of moving cities, of course. Crucial is choice of profession -- no one with ""mainstream"" jobs can make the shift seamlessly, given that tourism and mining remain the mainstays of Goa's economy.

Being an artist, writer or freelancer of some description helps. Over the past few decades, the move was also more easily made by single people or couples without children, since Goa did not have many schools that offered ""quality"" education.

Even 15-odd years ago, though, some disagreed. ""More options in a city like Mumbai is an illusion,"" says Karan Manral. Distance and cost, he says, make many inaccessible. Manral himself grew up as a navy kid in South Bombay. But by the late '90s, the population explosion and traffic snarls had made him restless.

By 2002, he had quit his job as editor of Digit and Chip magazines and moved to Goa. ""The city I loved when I was growing up was moving too fast,"" says Manral. He met his future wife Yogita Mehra in Goa.

Their daughter Tara, 6, attends the Shiksha Niketan primary school in Saligao. Manral, who went to school in Mumbai, claims there aren't more than five schools in that metro that can match the quality of education his daughter receives. ""This is what we need for her foundation,"" he says.

Things have changed since Manral moved. Not only are there mainstream schools such as the Delhi-affiliated Ardee School, unconventional schools are gaining popularity.

Paradise School in Aldona is just two years old, and it's filling up with children of erstwhile Delhiites and Mumbaikars. Its Internet-based, alternative teaching method, SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment), and International Cambridge Board is attracting expats, too.

Lisa Chowgule moved to Goa in 1989 from Mumbai. Since 1992, she's been running the Keshar Academy of Learning in Tiswadi, another alternative school, which follows the Waldorf teaching approach, and is also affiliated to the IGCSE or Cambridge board.

""There are no periods, no bells, no restriction of movement and no exams,"" says Chowgule.

For many who have made the move, Goa has also been about starting afresh. ""Goa is an opportunity to choose an alternative career,"" says Puja Mitra, who started Terra Conscious last year, an enterprise that promotes marine conservation and eco-sensitive tourism.

While Mitra arranges for boat-rides to discover the biodiversity of the Indian Ocean (especially the Indian humpback dolphins), her husband and co-founder Roshan Gonsalves gives scuba diving lessons. They have been living in Goa happily since 2012.

Manral and Mehra too built a new ""career"". In 2008, the couple started Green Essentials. They help people set up their own organic kitchen gardens, conduct workshops on sustainability and sell organic supplies at their store in Porvorim.

The drive to find a new vocation for all of these immigrants has in turn fed a cosmopolitan, alternative-thinking and culturally vibrant ecosystem.

Bhagyashree Patwardhan's Paper Boat Collective is a significant metaphor for the change wrought by newcomers. She too moved from Mumbai in 2012. ""Moving to Goa means a life spent less on the road and more at work.""

Now, her immaculately curated lifestyle store in Sangolda features clothes by revivalist designers such as Santanu Das, ceramics from Bengaluru emigre-turned-Goa resident Thomas Louis and a range of crafts. Paper Boat draws everyone with a taste for the chic and the ethically produced.

Designers Orijit Sen and Gurpreet Sidhu belong to the earlier wave of naturalised Goans. Circumstances took them back to Delhi for some years, but now their People Tree boutique, inside a beautiful old Portuguese villa, combines with the Gunpowder restaurant to bring a taste of big-city sophistication to a quiet, leafy village. The unit is named for the address -- simply, 6 Assagao.

The intermingling of old and new immigrants with locals happens at places like House No 248 in Sangolda, often over curated meals and jazz performances, or at annual multidisciplinary events like the Serendipity Arts Festival. Both Sen and Panjiar exhibited different aspects of Goa at last year's event.

For every person or family that hesitated before taking the plunge, Goa's lower cost of living has often been a decisive factor. Thanks to the wealthy Indians who built or bought second and third homes, about one in every five houses in Goa is vacant, according to the directorate of census operations.

Real estate prices are still climbing, especially at gated communities -- Sun Estates Developers's Solidago villas by the Nerul river start at Rs 40 million -- but rentals are low.

Manral and Mehra run Green Essentials out of an old, Portuguese villa, which is surrounded by enough land for their organic farming. The rent is Rs 20,000. They pay Rs 16,000 for their two-bedroom apartment nearby.

Anushya Sharma, a painter who moved to Goa from Assam in 2002, also lives in an old, Portuguese villa in Arpora, which she and her husband Jochem Vanderzwan, who works in restoration, rent for Rs 25,000.

Children from the neighbourhood often wander into their house to learn a thing or two about painting. ""Goa is about community living,"" says Sharma. ""But blending in takes time,"" she warns.

""I seem to meet someone I know who has moved here virtually every week,"" says Shrayragi Israni, who works with environmental action groups. But the sense of community bonding is so strong it can border on the oppressive for those who fled the big city in search of peace. ""This like-minded-people thing, well..."" sighs the reclusive artist Unnikrishnan.

Goans have been largely accepting of city folks, but there is some resentment. Goan lifestyle is not flamboyant, and gated colonies with luxury villas and swimming pools are viewed with suspicion.

Israni says the problem with the new settlers is that they continue to be urban customers who demand prompt services. ""Not all are aware of the kind of pressure they are putting on Goa's people and resources,"" she says.

Veteran Goan architect Dean D'Cruz feels that government neglect of essentials such as the Mapusa or Panjim bus stands and new focus on the proposed Mopa airport is breeding anger. But, says D'Cruz, ""A majority of settlers who are taking up old homes in villages are sensitive to the issues of the local people and the environment.""

Conservationist Joanna Pyres, who has a Goan pedigree but was born and raised in the UK, uses her engagement platform, Circlewallas, to bring together locals, Indian migrants and expats to find solutions.

""The know-how of a local, or the exposure of a settler, could be the missing piece to the jigsaw puzzle for a lasting solution,"" says Pyre, who has been in Goa for over ten years.

Journalist Vivek Menezes says that there are adjustment issues between locals and migrants the world over, but Goans are more tolerant.

""Despite the challenges, Goa is among the few places in the country where an outsider can become a local,"" he says.

It's an inviting idea. And many are accepting the invitation."

While rooting out such illegal schools is something governments have to do on a war footing, the condition of some state-run schools in the city is no better. Buildings with roofs partially caved in, cracks running across walls, leaking ceilings, broken urinals in washrooms and crumbling walls are what several government schools serve to the hundreds of students who turn up for classes every day. District elementary education officer Prem Lata Yadav, when asked about the state of infrastructure of government-run schools in the city, said, ""The reason behind the poor condition of school buildings is lack of funds. We've written to the education department to look into the issue.""

Government Senior Secondary School , Islampur

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon. MCG officials have taken measurements for the new construction a few months ago,"" said Kanwal Nain, principal. ""This building is small, old, and built on low land, because of which, at times, water accumulates at the entrance,"" he added.

Government Primary School, Satlaka

The 46 students of GPS Satlaka have to brace a school building falling apart at its seams. There are five classrooms, but all classes take place in only one, as the condition of the rest is terrible. ""One can spot cow dung on the floors, broken benches, blackboards and doors. Across the building, the seepage is so heavy that during monsoons this year, the roof of one classroom collapsed,"" said Virender Singh, guest teacher.

TOI also spotted dogs roaming in the classrooms. ""This entire building is unsafe and unfit for tiny tots. Since there is no guard, cows wander in and take shelter inside at night. I'm not paid to clean up the dung,"" said Rahisa, the school's sole sanitation staff. Since the building was constructed in 1972, no teacher has spent more than a year in this school.

Shivji Park Primary School

Shivji Park Primary School doesn't even have its own building. It operates out of Government Senior Secondary School Kadipur, whose classrooms are in a shambles. ""Students are forced to sit in the school hallway or even in the open, as none of the eight classrooms we've been allotted are usable,"" said head teacher Satpal. Even teachers of the Kadipur school are unaware when the crumbling walls were last repaired.

Govt Primary School, Kadipur

One look at the building of GPS Kadipur is enough to tll you that a disaster is waiting to happen. ""There are 180 students in this school. Every now and then, chunks of plaster fall off, making it dangerous for them. The old building has been declared a threat, and a new building is being constructed. Unfortunately, construction work stopped six months ago,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity.

Govt Primary Feroze Gandhi School Shivaji Park

The 70 tiny tots who study in GPFGS Shivaji Park, have to cross mounds of garbage and pools of stagnant water to enter the premises every day. ""Every day, locals throw trash in front of the school. We've spoken with the authorities, but this doesn't stop,"" said a teacher, requesting anonymity."

The aim is to detect unregistered schools as well as those not adhering to safety norms, officials said.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

""We have 685 government schools in Gautam Budh Nagar. However, these are not enough to meet the needs of a huge migrant population. At the same time, we cannot allow safety to be compromised,"" he added."

Classes, which are held in tin sheds, do not offer ideal insulation in the harsh weather. That is not all, cold drafts blowing in through gaps make comfort impossible in these schools, which are maintained by the UT and have been running for decades.

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Cracked walls in GMS, Palsora Colony make it impossible to warm the room. ""In such uncomfortable surroundings, students cannot focus on studies,"" said the parent of a school student.

Schools with concrete buildings do not have it easy either. Water seepage is a common problem. Leaky roofs, damp walls and rotting blackboards are common. School officials said they have informed authorities but the process of repair is slow.

Authorities from other government schools said these buildings have never been renovated.

The district education office itself is grappling with the problem of water seepage on the top floor, where water accumulates on the roof.

""We have to save documents after the rain as the roof leaks. So many letters have been written but nothing has been done,"" said an official, requesting anonymity.

""There is hardly any school that does not have the problem of water seepage and leaking roofs. One room or the other is always facing a problem,"" said Savinder Singh, chairman, Joint action committee of teachers.

""The education department must pressurize the engineering and public health department to conduct a thorough survey of all schools and act immediately,"" said Swarn Singh Kamboj, President, UT cadre, Educational Employees Union.

As per the preliminary discussions going on in the department, seasonal fruits could be served every day or every alternate day to the children. Officials say this idea emerged after questions were raised over the Akshaya Patra Foundation excluding garlic and onion in the food preparations, for which the department issued the non-profit organisation a notice.

The department has now written to the Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), seeking information on the nutritional value added by garlic and onion in the meal, and which food, vegetable or fruit can replace that.

""Once we receive the reply, the final decision will be taken about introducing fruit in the menu,"" a senior official said.

Akshaya Patra Foundation is also positive about providing fruit to the students. Naveena Neerada Dasa, head, Strategic Communication and Projects, said, ""In Hyderabad and Telangana, we already follow the practice of giving fruit with the meal.""

NO INSTRUCTIONS on EGGs and FRUITS

The school is also planning to start a junior college.

For both plans, the school is asking their alumni for funds. Some of the renowned alumni of the school are actresses Vidya Balan, Shilpa Shetty and Shraddha Das. The school has planned events such as Alumni meet, minithons, a school fete called Anthonian Ensemble, which provides a platform for the school's budding artists, sportspersons, entrepreneurs and others.

Philomena Joseph, senior teacher and core committee member of the school, said, ""We are not able to accommodate all the children in the present building. The classrooms are also getting crowded, making the children uncomfortable. The school premises is almost 86-years-old. Some parts of the structure are pretty weak despite several renovations. We would like to provide more services like full-fledged hobby classes. Every child will get special training in music and art.""

Echoing Joseph's sentiments, another senior teacher and core committee member, Pamela Zaccheus, said, ""The plan of the school is to come up with a new structure where all students will be shifted and the old buildings will be pulled down in phases. Some classrooms are used by the kindergarten and the Class V students too so the benches have also become little uncomfortable for students. We want to build separate structures for pre-primary, primary and secondary sections. Right now, classes are divided into different time slots. The plan is to run all sections in a single time slot.""

The school's headmistress, Sister Monica Raibole, said, ""Our school is the oldest educational institution in Chembur. We endeavour to provide quality education to empower the girl child. However, we are unable to substantially achieve our target due to growing demand and the need for spacious classes. Hence, we are undertaking the extension project."""

In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs,"" said Manish Sisodia.

Envisioned to be an extension of the Happiness Curriculum, Education Minister Manish Sisodia Tuesday announced that 'Entrepreneurship Curriculum' will be launched in the upcoming academic year for secondary and senior secondary students in the city's government schools. The aim is to create an ""entrepreneurial mindset"" in young people so they become ""job creators"" and not ""job seekers.""

The Happiness Curriculum was launched in July for students from nursery to Class VIII, to encourage mental well-being and ""human-centric education"".

During the first convocation of Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women on Tuesday, Sisodia announced that entrepreneurship classes will be held for one period of every school day for classes IX-XII. He said: ""We train all our focus on preparing for jobs -- this is a discourse we need to change. In convocations, we should celebrate people who did not accept big jobs and decided to do something that will generate jobs.""

The need for institutions to produce graduates who will generate jobs had earlier been raised by Sisodia at the convocation of Delhi Technological University last week, where he had called the act of generating jobs ""nationalist."" Speaking to The Indian Express, he said: ""Our schools only teach students to transfer pre-learnt knowledge, and not to think out of the box. Young people are afraid of being wrong, they have a fear of failure because of which they seek the security of a job. This needs to be done away with. That is one of the primary focus areas of the curriculum.""

The curriculum will not be a skill-based programme and will include components like ""personality and communication development"" and ""professionally inspiring stories"". Its framework is being charted, said officials.

Sisodia added that he has informally identified a team from the education department -- which he will formally select within a week. Inputs from domain experts will also be incorporated, Sisodia said.

""Models of entrepreneurship training already exist but they are not for children and are concentrated into shorter periods like two months. I want to extend these over a period of four years by weaving them into our school pedagogy to reshape their orientation and encourage innovation,"" said Sisodia. These classes are to be conducted by government school teachers themselves, for which they will receive training, said officials."

Moreover, the city has remained at the lowest level of pollution in December so far, thanks to light winter rains, a drop in high humidity levels and high wind velocity. The factors involved washed away the dust particles suspended in the air. But the city was 40 units more polluted than Delhi.

Tea, coffee to ward off sleep

Lucknow is set to extend its hospitality to drivers on the Lucknow-Agra Expressway by offering them free tea and coffee during the night hours soon so that they can ward off spells of sleep while driving. The step is aimed at helping reduce the number of accidents on the Expressway, particularly during the foggy season. Data shows that the majority of the accidents on the expressway take place between 10 pm and 6 am, after the drivers fell asleep. Tea and coffee stalls would be set up at intervals of 30 km. The driver and one more occupant of the four-wheeler would be served tea or coffee free of cost. If the number of passengers increases, then one would have to pay for every cup.

'Khelo Lucknow'

Over 32,000 budding sportspersons from the rural pockets of Lucknow will throng KD Singh 'Babu' Stadium to warm it up with their sporting talent at 'Khelo Lucknow' on December 30. The district administration's first-of-its-kind initiative aims to provide a platform to budding sportspersons from rural areas and give them the needed push to excel at the state and national levels. Participants in the age group of 10-16 years will play as juniors and those in the 17-30 age bracket will be treated as seniors. Of the 32,000 registered candidates, 10,000 will participate in the 100-metre sprint. Besides, there will be over 1,056 teams for kabaddi, 144 teams for volleyball, and 734 kho kho teams.

Parents' corner

The government is now targeting primary schools to popularise its welfare schemes. Soon, there will be a parents' corner in all government primary schools to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards. The added advantage of the corner would make parents keep a tack of their child's progress. The inspiration came from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district. It helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities.

City shivers

The city is in the grip of a cold wave, with the mercury plummeting significantly. Sunday was the coldest day of the season so far, with the minimum temperature plunging to 6.5 degrees Celsius, three degrees below normal. Strong winds from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir brought down the temperature. Muzaffarnagar was the coldest in the state at 3.4 degrees Celsius. Authorities are arranging bonfires, especially for the poor and homeless, during the night as the minimum temperature in the state capital is diving with each passing day. Despite the chill, the days remain pleasant."

Over the last 30 years, India has done a remarkable job ensuring its citizens have access to education. Beginning with State-level policies such as the Andhra Pradesh Primary Education Programme and Shiksha Karmi in Rajasthan in 1984 and 1987, respectively, and culminating in the Centre's Right to Education Act in 2009, the legislative and programmatic attention to education has been tremendous. And with that, there has been a genuine expansion in access and provision at the primary level.

In the chart, historical data from the District Information System on Education (DISE) on the year a school was built have been used to show how the number of government schools across the country has increased relative to three major Central Government education policies, the National Policy on Education in 1986, the District Primary Education Programme in 1994, and the aforementioned Right to Education Act.

Given that it has now been approximately 16 years since the passage of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the first central level effort, what has this flurry of activity brought? Encouragingly, there have been real wins over time. India has nearly universalised access to education and is now educating more people, including girls, for longer than it ever has before. The programmes have built schools, gotten children into schools, and had them stay in school for longer.

Additionally, it seems like this is also increasing employment and wages. A paper by Gaurav Khanna at the University of California, San Diego, finds that an additional year of schooling has high returns in the labour market, and that large-scale policies to expand education, such as the District Primary Education Programme, redistribute income from high-skilled to low-skilled workers. These are real achievements to celebrate. But this is about where the cheer ends.

On the learning front, the picture is far less rosy. Year after year of results from the Annual State of Education Report (ASER), released by the NGO ASER, has shown that student learning at the primary level is low and not getting better. In 2017, ASER shifted its focus from children at the primary level to ask what is happening with older children in the ages 14-18. Here, the news was no better. Math and reading ability for students in this age group were poor and well below what the government's own standards suggested they should be.

While the government's own National Achievement Survey is more encouraging, it is not by much. India's performance in the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (more commonly known as PISA) tests was so controversial that India did not re-enter PISA again (although India has decided to re-enter for 2021). This story of low learning levels is well known to many.

What should we make of these two contradictory findings? On the one hand, access to education has increased, and this is showing real returns on the labour market, and redistribution skills towards low-skilled workers. On the other hand, learning is low for young and older children; it is not improving, and is poor even in comparison to other countries. A new concern is beginning to emerge with the growing demographic bulge of large numbers of young adults exiting the school system and entering the workforce. The promises of the education system are failing on more than just quality, and this could have dire consequences for those promised the world.

A new genre of non-fiction has emerged over the last couple of years tracing the gap between the aspirations and realities for India's youth. Journalists Somini Sengupta and Snigdha Poonam have both written books profiling this new young aspirational class, and many of their dashed aspirations. In both, we find a number of young Indians struggling to find their place in the world. Promised much by their educational attainment, they find their hopes dashed when they emerge into the adult world, with jobs that either fall short of expectations, or a lack of formal employment altogether.

My own work suggests a similar concern -- those that have gone to school for longer are less likely to be trusting of a wide number of public institutions in India.

Using the Indian Human Development Survey, I find that those children that gained access to education as a result of the DPEP then live in households that are less trusting of public institutions. More concerning, those ""DPEP children"" are adults today with their political preferences and economic aspirations.

Why is this happening? The data suggest that while these individuals are earning more money, they are also doing this in different parts of the labour market: the unorganised and short-term contractual labour. Again, the gap between aspirations and reality has led to resentment.

Latin America has seen the rise of a cohort of youth called ""Los NiNis,meaning ""They neither study or work.""

So what can India and other countries, do? There are two solutions: fix schools or fix the school-to-work transition. While fixing schools is clearly important and there is much to be done here, placing undue faith in schools as the sole panacea for this cohort will likely not solve the larger problem of a large number of youth who enter a labour market not as rewarding as promised and cause further distrust in the education system. Schools cannot be blamed for both their own failings and the failings of the outside world.

That leaves us with fixing the school-to-work transition. And here, most solutions lie with the state. Public sector employment -- the much desired sarkari naukri -- has not grown apace with the growth in India's population. According to Devesh Kapur, public sector employment has actually decreased over the last decade.

So an expansion of the public sector is clearly in order. While this will not absorb all of those looking for employment, it will help absorb some as well as address some of India's public management issues.

Next, some combination of general training, labour market matching, and support for employers in hiring young adults is required. Here, the results for middle- and low-income countries are encouraging.

It is clear that the question of how to integrate youth into a larger society is a universal one that spans more regions than just India. The solution, however, likely does not lie with education.

While there are many shortcomings of the education system in India and elsewhere, the question for society is about how to best integrate the young when they have left compulsory schooling but have yet to find work.

It is here that further progression through the education system will run headlong into frustrated expectations as a result of poor integration into labour markets and larger society. To paraphrase WEB DuBois, the problem of the 21st century is the problem of youth employment."

The desire for globalization, urbanization, better education and employment opportunities is driving the ELT program. With the advent of the Internet, information and communication technology (ICT) tools are being used to provide learning content in digital form. Digital English learning consists of digital content and products that facilitate language learning through ICT tools.

The number of students entering graduate schools in English speaking countries has increased, making the biggest contribution to the growth of this market. In the tertiary education sector, universities in the United States, Australia, the UK and Canada are required to take the English Test (TOEFL), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and the International English Test System (IELTS). Students are required to enroll in a private English Language Institute (ELT) in order to earn excellent grades on this exam. These developments have increased demand for ELT in countries like India and China. The number of graduates who move to countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States for advanced research each year is increasing markedly. This increase in English learners will drive the growth of the global digital English learning market during the forecast period.

His lawyers had asked for a plea bargain after his arraignment on November 19 but the request was rejected by the judge.

""This kind of issue is too rampant in our tertiary institutions. We send children to school, they come home telling us that lecturers want to sleep with them,"" judge Onyetenu said.

Akindele was found guilty on all four charges and sentenced to two years in jail.

""We cannot continue like this. Somebody has to be used as example. Even primary schools pupils are complaining,"" Onyetenu said.

""It is time for the court to start upholding the right of the children, especially female students. The case is endemic,"" she added.

A student had come forward in April with a recording of the management and accounting lecturer demanding that she sleep with him or fail the course. Akindele was arrested and sacked from his job in June.

The 'sex for marks' case has struck a nerve in Nigeria, where sexual harassment is an issue but is rarely talked about in public.

Both Houses were adjourned within minutes of convening -- the Lok Sabha for an hour till noon and the Rajya Sabha till 2 pm -- only to be adjourned for the day within minutes of reconvening, with no discussions over any of the pending bills.

The primary demand of Congress MPs was an investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) into the Rafale deal.

Amid the din in the Lok Sabha, party leader Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a JPC investigation into the fight jet agreement and also questioned whether the government was indeed ready for a discussion or debate on the Rafale controversy. To support his argument, he pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi rarely comes to Parliament and ""doesn't say two words in the House"". Khadge also raised questions about the CAG and PAC reports that the Centre made claims about to the Supreme Court.

File image of Parliament. PTI

Besides the Rafale deal, MPs of the AIDMK and DMK, too, disrupted proceedings as they have been demanding that the Centre revoke the permission granted to Karnataka to construct a reservoir-cum-drinking water project at Mekedatu across the Cauvery river. MPs of the Telugu Desam Party also shouted slogans in the House, demanding special category status for Andhra Pradesh.

Congress versus BJP

The Lok Sabha turned into a battlegound for sloganeering by members of the rival party, with both coming up with their own versions of ""gali, gali mein shor hai...""

The session began with BJP leaders holding up placards that read ""Rahul Gandhi maafi maango"" (Rahul Gandhi apologise), referring to his comments on the Rafale deal. Leaders of both parties then tried to out-shout each other -- with the BJP crying ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, Rahul Gandhi chor hai"" and ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, Rahul Gandhi chor hai"", and the Congress adopting its favourite ""Gali, gali mein shor hai, chowkidaar chor hai"" slogan.

More than 30 members from the AIADMK, the TDP and the Congress trooped into the Well during the Question Hour, despite appeals by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan to return to their seats and allow discussions in the Lok Sabha.

Along with the Speaker, a few ministers made a valiant effort to discuss agrarian issues, and a minister even succeeded in introducing the National Institute of Design (Amendment) Bill. But attempts at a discussion were futile, and Mahajan adjourned the House soon after.

Speaker schools MPs

Parliament is for discussion and debate, the Lok Sabha Speaker said after MPs continued to disrupt proceedings and didn't allow any issues to be discussed.

""The government is ready to discuss anything you want, but this is not the way. It is not sending a good message. We have to face the public,"" she said. ""I'm requesting you again and again. Whatever discussions you want will be done as per the rules.""

""People abroad also ask what is happening in the Indian Parliament?... We must show some responsibility. I'll request the government myself to hold a discussion. We must maintain a standard in Parliament.""

After her appeals fell on deaf ears, Mahajan adjourned the House for the day.

Exasperated Naidu adjourns Rajya Sabha with no debate

Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha Venkaiah Naidu began the day's session with an appeal to MPs to allow the House to hold discussions, promising to list subjects for discussion as per priority, but to no avail.

Like the Lok Sabha, the Upper House, too, was adjourned till 2 pm within minutes of convening after several MPs stood near the chair's podium and began to shout slogans. Among them were leaders of the AIADMK and DMK, who held placards and protested with slogans against Karnataka's proposed dam on the Cauvery river.

Before the House was adjourned, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said the most important issue was that of the breach of privilege of the House by the government in the Rafale deal. ""The government has misled Parliament and the Supreme Court through a wrong affidavit, and thus it misled the country on the Rafale deal,"" Azad said.

Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Vijay Goel said the government was ready to discuss all issues, including Rafale, in the Rajya Sabha, accusing the Opposition of ""running away from discussion"". As the ruckus continued, Naidu adjourned the House till 2 pm.

After the House reconvened, Congress leader Anand Sharma objected to BJP leaders demanding an apology from Rahul Gandhi for his statements on the Rafale deal. But BJP leaders shouted down his statements, forcing Naidu to adjourn the House for the day within four minutes of reconvening.

When Adith AK packed his bags and left for Majuli, an island in the Brahmaputra river in Assam, in 2017, he did not imagine that he would end up staying there a whole year. ""My backpack had clothes to last me a week; I planned on staying only that long, just having a look around,"" he said.

But something there compelled him to stay put. Back in Chennai for a story recital for Tulika Books, he narrated the reason why.

Before moving to Majuli, Adith wore many hats: storyteller, performer, theatre artiste and dancer. After working with him on a dance video, his friend's friend introduced him to Bipin Dhane, founder of the Ayang trust that runs the Hummingbird School, in rural Majuli -- a primary school providing education to around 250 students.

""Bipin asked me to come and teach whatever I could there, but I did not want to take part in the academics. I wanted to teach kids through theatre or dance. Thankfully, Bipin agreed,"" he said. The Hummingbird, he added, gives tribal communities the relevant education. Books by education boards have lessons that they can't relate to, he said.

For his part, Adith works on teaching children movement. ""I work with teachers on their students' balance, proper hand-eye coordination, especially for younger children who are still working on their fine motor skills,"" he said.

He also trains them in teaching basic subjects through role play. ""For example, we were teaching a group of students about the digestive system. So we divided them into sections and had each of them play a different organ, in rotation. Or say, if you want to do simple addition or subtraction, you role-play as shopkeepers and customers. This helps with memory retention.""

Though he wanted to concentrate on theatre and dance, he also ended up taking charge of administrative work such as fund raising, building libraries and more. ""We collected bamboo and with the help of the locals, built a stage to hold plays,"" he said. He now works with 16 Government schools in the district. He helps teachers integrate theatre into teaching practices.

Life in Majuli, which became the first island to be made a district in India, in 2016, can be slow. The tribal communities form most of the population, and agriculture is the main source of economy. The area has pockets of forests.

Said Adith, ""I was scared I would get bored of the slow lifestyle there. But after a year there, I have realised how kind the people are, and how sustainable the lifestyle there is. I have so much more to learn, I am not coming back anytime soon."""

The application process for admissions to entry-level classes in over 1,600 private schools began on Saturday.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has also advised parents to not approach these schools till the department issues further orders in case any penal action is initiated against schools found to be defaulting the new rules.

""In order to maintain transparency and uniformity in admission, the admission process of these 105 schools at entry level for session 2019-20 shall be on hold till further orders,"" a senior DoE official who was familiar with the matter said. ""If it is found that the said schools are taking admissions despite being prevented to do so, necessary action as per norms will be taken without any further notice,"" the official added.

The distance of student's residence from school, sibling quota, parents being alumni of the school, single child, first child are some of the criteria listed by schools for admissions to the entry-level classes. According to the schedule released by the DoE, the application window will be open from Saturday and the last date of submitting application forms for nursery class admission for 2019-20 session is January 7.

The first list of selected children, along with marks secured by them, will be out on February 4.

The second list will be out on February 21 and the nursery admission process will conclude on March 31.

Twenty-five per cent seats in pre-school, pre-primary and class 1 will be reserved for economically weaker sections EWS)/disadvantaged groups under the Right To Education Act. The directorate had instructed all private schools to upload their criteria -- with points for each criterion -- for admission in open seats, on its official website by December 14. There is, however, no clarity yet on the schedule of the EWS admissions.

The government has also set an upper age limit of less than four years to be eligible for nursery, less than five years for kindergarten, and less than six years for admission to class 1. The proposal for an upper age limit was challenged in the court last year. Though a Delhi High Court order last year had allowed the imposition of the upper age limit, the DoE had decided that the order will be applicable only from 2019 academic session. Apart from the abolished criteria, the schools have been given autonomy to come up with their own points system.

More than 5,000 students in 14 schools are forced to sit on floors, as there no desks and benches, and 44 schools do not have Jal Board water connections.

These details emerged during the SDMC House meeting on Monday, in response to questions asked by the Leader of Opposition, AAP's Praveen Kumar.

Kumar, the councillor from Sitapur, said: ""The (BJP) made tall promises of deploying women marshalls and CCTVs, but in several schools, teachers open gates as there are no security guards at all."" South Corporation Education committee chairperson Nandini Sharma said, ""The files have been moved. Tenders are being invited and work orders will be issued. We are expecting to get things moving by February.""

Sharma added: ""We recieved Rs 46 crore instead of Rs 89 crore in funds. We are giving Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,100 to students as subsidy for uniforms."" To which, Kumar said: ""Desks and benches will wear out every year. Preparations should have been done in advance."""

Claiming that their livelihoods were affected, more than 50 people from those families staged a protest at the collectorate on Monday. The protest kept police personnel on their toes as the protesters kept moving on the premises. They also laid siege to SUV of the collector.

More than 100 people belonging to Malai Kuruvar community were staying on the banks of Noyyal river on Noyyal road near Valarmathi in the dollar city for many years. Involving in phenol selling and bamboo weaving for their livelihoods, they were staying in tent-like structures on the roadside. The district administration had provided housing patta to all the 35 families at Mudhalipalayam but all those lands were already being allotted to some other beneficiaries.

On the eve of inauguration of a lodging facility owned by an AIADMK functionary on the same road, the corporation authorities forcibly removed the families on December 13 without allocating any houses or plots. The corporation officials said they have recommended the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (Tnscb) to allocate houses to them in under-construction housing apartment at Palavanjipalayam near Veerapandi.

""We were made to stay in an open place at Palavanjipalayam near Veerapandi. But a man who claimed to be the owner of the land threatened us to leave. He told us that the land was given to Tnscb for keeping construction material,"" said M Murugan, 31, one of the protesters.

""When we informed about it to the corporation officials, we were shown a land in Kovilvazhi, where garbage was being dumped. So, we refused to move there,"" said Murugan.

""The eviction has affected our livelihoods as we do not get water either for making phenol or for our own consumption. The civic body supplied water in a tanker lorry for first two days and it was stopped. In Valarmathi, we could get fresh water round-the-clock,"" said B Mari.

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

With greater acknowledgement of hand hygiene in infection control, the global market for hand hygiene is likely to display substantial advancement. Practicing hand hygiene is one of the simplest, most inexpensive yet most effective ways of preventing infections and diseases. Research in healthcare proves that cleaning one's hands thoroughly can significantly reduce the spread of germs. As a result, hand hygiene is correctly termed as a 'do-it-yourself' vaccine.

Eating food with contaminated hands can result in contracting diseases such as staph, salmonella, e-coli, respiratory illnesses, and gastrointestinal disorders such as diarrhea. Cleaning hands properly can significantly reduce the risk of these contagious diseases.

Global Hand Hygiene Market: Drivers and Restraints

The increasing use of soaps, hand wash, sanitizers, rubs, and disinfectants is guiding the growth of the market. The shift from conventional soap bars to liquid hand wash, growing bacterial and pathogen infections, rising number of healthcare practitioners, and healthcare associated infections are contributing towards market growth.

Preview Report @ www.transparencymarketresearch.com/hand-hygiene-market.html

The U.S.-based healthcare organization, Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), has introduced a campaign called 'Clean Hands Count', which empowers patients to participate in their care by reminding or asking healthcare professionals to wash their hands. The campaign addresses the various misconceptions and myths surrounding hand hygiene.

On the other hand, absence of hygiene-related training and education in several regions might slacken the growth of the market. Moreover, studies reveal that a low percentage of world population practice hand hygiene. Experts believe that the low grasp of facts about the importance of hand hygiene among people is the reason for this low percentage.

However, the persistent efforts to spread awareness about the significance of hand hygiene by several international and government bodies through campaigns and programs is expected to aid the expansion of the market.

The initiatives of the World Health Organization (WHO), such as 'SAVE LIVES: Clean Your Hands' campaign (2009), Clean Care is Safer Care program (2005-2015), and Infection Prevention and Control (2015-2017), that focus on the prevention of on-site infection among healthcare workers and patients will be successful in creating awareness about the importance of hand hygiene, thereby boosting the expansion of the market. In alignment with the aims of these programs, the WHO declared May 5 as the World Hand Hygiene Day

Global Hand Hygiene Market: Regional Outlook

Based on geography, the global hand hygiene market can be segmented into Asia Pacific, North America, Europe, and the Rest of the World (RoW). North America is likely to dominate the regional scenario as high awareness related to hand hygiene, training to healthcare professionals, and adherence of standard guidelines are guiding the growth of the hand hygiene market in this region.

A number of health systems and hospitals in the U.S., such as Cedars-Sinai, Froedtert Hospital, Baptist Health, and Exempla Lutheran Medical Center, have been participating in the promotion of hand hygiene by ensuring the compliance on the part of healthcare providers through education programs, hand hygiene protocols, and stringent monitoring.

Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Africa furnish considerable opportunities for growth. Implementation of hand hygiene campaigns in these developing regions is a major factor promising growth, resulting from rising awareness. WASH-in-School, a program initiated by UNICEF in China, for instance, promotes the construction of drinking water fountains and toilets in schools, in addition to promotion of hand hygiene.

In India, Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), in collaboration with Swach Bharat Abhiyaan campaign, has been encouraging every citizen to wash hands regularly, before eating and cooking and after using the toilet.

Companies Mentioned in the Report

Some of the major companies operating in the global market for hand hygiene are Whiteley Corporation, EcoHydra, Deb Group, Kimberly-Clark, Kutol, Medline Industries, Inc., and GOJO Industries. These companies provide a wide range of hand hygiene products such as sanitizers, soaps, and hand wash.

""What is the name of the Chief Minister"", I asked a group of tribal women in Mahasamund. It was my first field trip to Chhattisgarh and I was a rookie with one year of experience in the development sector. With all the scepticism that new idealists could gather, I felt that women not knowing the name of the Chief Minister of the state would reflect on their agency, and hence would give me a starting point to discuss decentralised governance with them!

""I do not know his name, but 'chawal waale baba' is what we call him"". Mahasamund has always been a Congress dominated belt and the response came as a shock to me. For the next couple of hours, I went on to talk of a lot of things, but what dominated the discussion was how the women in the village zealously monitor the fair price shops and how this 'chawal waale baba' is doing some good work for them.

Few days back, Dr Raman Singh was about to face a defeat in his constituency of Rajnandgaon from which he has been contesting elections since the early 90s. He somehow managed to scrape through but the government and his party could not be saved. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been reduced to 15 seats in the state and has lost out across all demographies and geographies in the state. But, 15 years is not a small time and Dr Raman Singh has presided over the most significant period of change in the state. So what is his legacy and what is the way ahead for him, politically?

Before the arrival of the Gujarat success story by the fag end of 2014, Chhattisgarh was the state where the issue of development was front and centre in electoral terms. It was a state carved out of Madhya Pradesh to help the tribal and the Scheduled Caste communities and hence, the articulation of development here was also very different. Development in Chhattisgarh in the way Raman Singh articulated meant a turnaround in fortunes and not just a facelift.

As one of the states with the largest tribal population, abject poverty and violent Left wing extremism, Chhattisgarh needed that narrative of transition and Raman Singh was the one who provided it. And this was not the development of mega industries and four-lane highways and metros criss-crossing cities. This was the development of getting people adequate food to eat and putting the first generation of learners in schools and bringing the first pucca roads to a village. It was development from scratch.

If we look at the Chhattisgarh story since the past 15 years, there are two aspects of governance which would stand out as the legacy of Dr Raman Singh.

Social Development Legacy

The biggest success story in Chhattisgarh under Dr Singh was the efficiency of the public distribution system (PDS). Chhattisgarh took an unabashed Left route in approaching food security and increased the PDS coverage to 74 per cent. Moreover, when other states were experiencing major issues of pilferage and looting, the Chhattisgarh government undertook a slew of reforms to address the situation.

The first concern that Raman Singh identified after taking office was that more than 50 per cent of the below poverty line (BPL) population, were unable to access the food grains meant for them. The first reform he brought in was taking away the ownership of PDS shops from private businessmen and handing over control to the local community.

Then came other measures like issuing new ration cards with holograms which weeded out over 3 lakh fake beneficiaries, increased commission and even a seed fund to shop operators for making the business viable, increased monitoring and vigilance including community audits, doorstep delivery of food grains and raids and massive crackdown of corrupt rice millers. Raman Singh without any doubt made PDS the key to his re-election in 2008 and there was no other issue which worked, except 'chawal'.

The victory of 2008 was on the back of the almost transformational change in the supply chain of the PDS and sealed the tag of 'chawal waale baba'. The Chhattisgarh success story was so convincing that even some stalwarts in Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council (NAC) had to use it as a template.

The success of PDS in Chhattisgarh had an expected ripple effect on the nutritional levels in the state. Food scarcity in tribal belts leads to malnutrition and stunting, and Chhattisgarh managed to address this issue thoroughly. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 data shows that the percentage of adult women with body mass index (BMI) less than normal has decreased from 43.4 per cent in 2005-06 to 26.7 in 2015-16. It is less than the figures for MP and Jharkhand and almost the same as Odisha, even though it recorded a higher incidence level than all three states in 2005-06.

Another important change has been the decrease in instances of anaemia in infants which has reduced from 71.2 per cent in 2005-06 to 41.6 per cent in 2015-16. It has now reached below the national average, while the states of MP, Jharkhand and Odisha still register more instances of infant anaemia. The final indicator which directly speaks about malnutrition is the incidences of stunting.

The following figure provides an idea of how Chhattisgarh has progressed on addressing stunting and underweight issues in children. The only state which has fared better than Chhattisgarh is Odisha but it also needs to be seen that Chhattisgarh had a much higher base in 2005-06.

This is no minor feat. With the PDS covering basic food-grains in villages, schools and anganwadi centres, the savings of the poor could be used to widen the basket of nutritious food, thus effectively tackling malnutrition. The single minded focus of Raman Singh on one issue paid off both socially and politically for him.

If Vasundhara Raje has been the most economic right wing chief minister from the BJP, Raman Singh has undoubtedly been the most towards the Left. He is known for a slew of populist welfare schemes in the state. His focus on health and nutrition extended to his CM Health Scheme whereby Rs 30,000 worth of free treatment was provided to citizens. Other welfare schemes ranged from the Saraswati Cycle Yojana for school girls to the Mukhyamantri Teerth Yatra Yojana for elderly citizens.

Combating Left Wing Extremism In The State

Since the day the new state of Chhattisgarh was born, the single biggest problem impeding the development initiatives was the 'red terrorism' plaguing multiple districts of the state.

Raman Singh has been at the centre of a lot of controversy when it comes to combating Left wing extremism and his government has been accused of custodial violence against tribals, harassment of activists like Binayak Sen and most importantly tacit support given to the Salwa Judum. Raman Singh in the past has openly defended the Salwa Judum as being the primary resistance force against the Maoists.

In 2009, just two years before the Salwa Judum was disbanded by the Supreme Court, Dr Singh had credited the members of the vigilante group as being the custodians of the republic. The formation of the Salwa Judum led to one of the bloodiest phases in the state and the tribal communities were divided and displaced like never before. It is a cross that both the Congress and the BJP have to bear. But, as the CM for 15 long years, it can never be dissociated from the legacy of Raman Singh.

While Chhattisgarh continues to be the state, most affected by Maoist violence, through the course of the past 15 years, the Raman Singh government had many big and small successes in addressing the alienation of the tribal communities and ushering in peace. From the construction of state highways to schemes like allowances for pregnant and lactating mothers, a mix of infrastructural and welfare measures had been implemented in tribal areas along with numerous awareness and sensitisation campaigns.

While the districts of Sarguja and Jashpur have now been removed from the list of Maoist affected districts, the most significant transformation has been seen in the district of Bastar. The Dandakaranya belt is the hotbed of Maoist activity in the country and has been the scene of the most dastardly acts of violence against the state. Carrying out development activities in this area and then seeing tangible returns of inclusion is no mean feat.

It is a three-pronged strategy where the security forces and the civic administration work in tandem to ensure that relative peace facilitates rapid infrastructural development and the cycle continues without further incidents. The third prong is ensuring that key entitlements to the local communities and their rights under PESA are respected. This has been a strategy that the Chhattisgarh government under Dr Singh has made moderate success in.

One of the most significant changes in the Maoist areas of the state has been the rapid construction of roads. These roads have not only ended the alienation of remote villages but have pushed the Maoists further into the jungles. Conversely, it has also been the cause behind much of the attacks in the state since 2014.

The two stretches which have seen the most attacks are the Dornapal-Jagargunda stretch and the Injeram-Bhejji stretch which are incidentally the two critical road construction stretches. Bastar, today, is being dotted with educational institutions and health care centres. There are three districts in the region which still can be counted as war zones and the Maoist threat is far from over. But, change has happened right under the barrel of the gun and for that Dr Raman Singh deserves a lot of credit.

My first trip to Mahasamund for a study was in 2013. The last one was in 2017 when I travelled to Ambikapur, Sarguja, another Congress belt. This time I was not working with women but with adolescent girls. Their concerns were different. They needed English classes and computer skills, and well-paying jobs. Some of them told me that the 'sattu' provided by the government under the SABLA scheme is used for feeding cattle, a far cry from conversations of adequate nutrition. Survival and chawal was not the topic of discussion. Aspiration and jobs were.

I again asked them about the CM. All of them knew his name, Dr Raman Singh. For the new generation with new hopes, he was not 'chawal waale baba' anymore. He was just another politician who needed to deliver on new demands. That, perhaps, sums up why the development agenda of Raman Singh did not work. There is a new generation holding the keys to power now and the old guard could not keep up with their aspirations.

While the legacy of Dr Raman Singh has been development, it has mostly been around subsistence. Food security, access to health, even footwear for tired feet! It is perhaps what the need was that point but subsistence will never be enough. With his share of successes and controversies and lost time, Dr Singh needs to be given the due credit he deserves.

It is to his credit to have governed one of the most difficult, conflict ridden states in India and gradually relieve parts of it from the backward status it had been stamped with. While a large number of districts in Chhattisgarh continue to be aspirational while the rest of the country surges forward, it is to his credit that the dreams of Naya Raipur and Naya Bastar have not been pushed to the background.

And importantly, his PDS success story has been the one which exhibits what true political will can achieve even in the face of immense odds. This could very well have been the end of his stint as the CM of the state, but the road from Raipur via Bastar may just lead to New Delhi."

The fiscal deficit which was put at Rs 19529 crore in the Revised Estimates is expected to come down to Rs 13996 crore in 2019-20. Whether the gap of nearly Rs6000 crores was proposed to be filled with reduced expenditures or imposing of some taxes later, has not been specified clearly in the Budget. On the other hand , however, additional resources required were projected at Rs 9876 crores in the Revised Estimates for the current fiscal and Rs4340 crore for 2019-20.

Since avenues of earning revenues by the Government are limited on account of not widening the tax base and revising the existing ones to keep pace with its ever increasing expenditure , proposing no new taxes has been a popular measure as the source of income is the massive grants from the Centre which constitute nearly 44% and an additional 18% as the State's share from the Central Taxes. On the other hand, as much as 27% of the revenues are spent on salaries and pensions, paid to Government employees and pensioneRs Agriculture gets an enhanced allocation of Rs 20 crore which appears to be too low but perhaps constraints of balancing the Budget without expanding revenue base demanded it. However 50% subsidy is proposed for vans which are refrigerated to transport perishable items like vegetables and fruits. In Education Rs 350 crore are proposed to be allocated for new colleges and Rs 100 crore there-from, to be spent on providing benches and desks in primary and middle schools.

A long demand of the people of Ladakh for setting up of a University in that part of the State has been conceded and Ladakh was going to have its first ever University with an initial grant of Rs 65 crore , of course by the next fiscal. The Budget is designed to give a major push to building infrastructure for which Rs 30469 crore stand earmarked for investment. An important aspect of infrastructural development is in the form of keeping budgetary provisions of Rs3631 crore for various projects languishing in the state. Besides, the Budget aims at laying the requisite thrust on Panchayats, Municipalities and sports. Governor appears to give sports a major boost in the State by allocating Rs 350 crore to it and allied activities. He has many times felt the dire need to promote sports to channelize the activities of the youth in the positive direction as there was enough potential available which needed to be chiselled and moulded properly with providing more facilities. Health and medical care gets Rs 350 crore mainly for completion of construction of buildings for Medical Colleges and District Hospitals while Rs 100 crore is proposed for purchasing new equipment in hospitals.

However, the Budget appears to be envisioned to bring about overall development especially ensuring languishing projects like drinking water, construction of bridges, roads and welfare measures to get completed as soon as possible . The State needs a lot of private investment to infuse new vigour on the economic front for which peace and tranquillity is required which is directly related to assured dividends to investors."

Difficult roads, they say, often lead to beautiful destinations. There may be multiple challenges, but one thing binds India's change-makers together - they view problems as means for innovation. From tackling unemployment to becoming financially independent and providing livelihoods to others at a time of personal tragedy, YourStory brings you stories of social impact through the Monday Motivation series.

As we draw closer towards the end of 2018, here are some of our top picks from the year.

Recognising the vulnerabilities of migrants who move from rural areas to urban India, Vinod Pandey started a ""tea stall"" with a difference - Rozgar Dhaba, at Shehore district's Nashrullaganj block in Madhya Pradesh. The dhaba not only sells tea and refreshments, but acts as a centre for the exchange of information on livelihood and employment opportunities.

""I am from Bihar and have seen how people from Bihar migrate to different cities in search of jobs, especially for daily wage labour. An elder cousin migrated to Punjab and died because he did not get proper work in the city; he lived in slums, without proper healthcare. The city failed him,"" Vinod says.

Started in January 2018, Rozgar Dhaba caters to over a 1,000 people a month and has hosted over 20 job fairs, and five farm produce sale displays till date. It has over 70 registered entities such as government agencies, skill centres, NGOs, district agriculture centres, grameen centres, and small local businesses that provide regular job information. The dhaba itself provides employment to almost 10 people and has revenue of Rs 8,000 to Rs 12,000.

At a time when rote learning and academic-based examination continue to dominate the Indian school system, a 21-year-old student from IIT-Madras is on a mission to change the way knowledge is imparted. Using the peer teaching model, which has Harvard University's stamp of approval, Divanshu Kumar hopes to improve the learning ability of students through his startup, Involve.

""Most of the world believes that we can improve the quality of learning and have better results by putting more qualified teachers in the classrooms. And while this is true, it fails to address one very important need: capability building of students,"" he says.

Involve's peer teaching method involves a nine-month fellowship where students from higher grades, like from Class 8, can teach and mentor juniors. By getting students who can teach and learners together in a classroom, Involve aims to create a school ecosystem that defines a student's potential not merely in terms of examinations, but through overall academic and personal excellence.

Till date, the team has worked with over 400 students across four schools in Chennai and Bengaluru. These include more than 100 student leaders.

To introduce food processing techniques and create links in the agri-business model, Balaji Balaraman, 35, started Agribolo. The startup aims to create a market linkage opportunity that can become a farm-to-fork, farm-to-mill, and farm-to-warehouse model for farmers and the ecosystem at large.

""The primary necessities include creating multiple pre-processing or primary centres at the farm or village level. That will provide a basic value addition to farmers and an opportunity to develop a cluster-based model,"" Balaji says.

The farmer engagement platform allows an individual to get an umbrella of services under one roof at his location and according to the season, relevance, demand, supply, and in a timely and efficient manner. Agribolo engages and connects farmers with experts, NGOs, and development institutes for training, capacity building, and outreach programmes.

The startup offers a platform to aggregate services in the form of farm mechanisation, plant nursery, protected cultivation, seed production, input demonstration, collateral management, financial inclusion, and local processing that could be co-owned and operated by the community at large.

The farmer is also provided an opportunity to partner with a business solution - available on the platform - that empowers him towards rural employment and social empowerment.

Josephine Arokiya Mary, a National Award winner for apiculture, started her journey with 10 bee boxes. She now has 7,000 bee boxes, and has helped create more than 1,800 entrepreneurs in her district.

In 2010, a year after her daughter's death, Mary took a loan of Rs 10 lakh from Canara Bank to start Vibis Natural Bee Farming with 1,000 bee boxes. Targeting diabetic patients, she accumulated and harvested jamun honey, which gave her good revenues; soon, Mary started harvesting honey from more than 10 varieties of bees. Apart from selling honey, she diversified her business by selling bee wax candles and the pollen bees carry on their legs.

Mary is now known as Queen Bee in her village and sells honey to 23 districts in Tamil Nadu. She offers 25 varieties of honey with flavours like jamun, neem, and amla among others, through her enterprise. She now earns more than Rs 1 lakh per month, and her venture has an annual turnover of Rs 3 crore.

Besides providing employment to over 50 people and helping over 400 women set up honey bee farms, she is training more than 50,000 people in bee harvesting under the National Honey Mission and creating awareness to save bees from going extinct.

Prem Singh's lush green farmland paints a vivid picture of sustainable farming: organic produce and homegrown compost, fruit-bearing trees, livestock shelter with water bodies, well-nourished soil, natural fertilisers, and, most importantly, a continuous source of income.

""I too was captured in the cycle of debt and crop failure; we couldn't control climatic conditions and bank loans kept increasing. And then I started thinking about our ancestors, our traditional farming methods, and knew that this was the key to success. Today, I am debt-free. I am a pragatisheel kisaan,"" he says proudly.

Advocating Avartansheel Kheti, or periodic proportionate farming, Prem Singh believes that farming has to be a self-sustaining occupation for the farmer. The practice encourages a farmer to divide his land into three parts: one-third to be used as a garden to grow fruits and crops, the second part for rearing livestock, and the third to grow timber. His approach advocates crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, improving soil fertility, and seed development.

This farming method is currently followed by 28 percent farmers in his district and also has followers from the agrarian community of Belgium and France."

Data was collected using a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) across 18 schools in Bengaluru. Results revealed children and adolescents face issues in five categories: Emotion, conduct, hyperactivity, peer relations and pro-social behaviour. The survey was conducted by AddressHealth, a school health services provider, from June to August.

""As many as 16.7 per cent of primary, middle and high school students surveyed suffered difficulties that could lead to anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, conduct disorders, depression, etc. In this survey, 12 to 15 per cent high school students were found suffering from emotional and social skill issues, while eight to 10 per cent primary school kids suffered conduct and hyperactivity issues,"" said Dr Anand Lakshman, founder of AddressHealth.

Government and private schools following CBSE, ICSE and Karnataka state syllabus were part of this exercise. Teachers and parents filled out questionnaires about students' behaviour.

""Conduct issues such as bullying, not listening to the teacher, aloofness, were factors noticed more by teachers than parents. This is a screening tool and not a diagnostic one. It helped us identify who is more prone to risk. For instance, contemplation of suicide among adolescents warrants seeking treatment, which we provided later through group therapy,"" Lakshman added.

The causes included imbalance of neurochemicals in the brain, social and environmental stressors such as pressure to perform, hyper-competitive nature, overexposure to information on the internet (for example, blue whale challenge being seen as a solution to solve one's problems), nutritional aspects such as high sugar content in food eaten by hyperactive kids, need for instant gratification in terms of likes and approval on social media, etc.

""Most issues stem from childhood. It is a known fact that only 12 to 15 per cent adults seek help. Most do not take treatment due to stigma, so adults pass on their anxieties and stressors to their kids. Depression is used as a bad word. The brain is more susceptible to change when the child is young,"" a public health expert said, further adding, ""Late treatment cannot modify the way the brain works, but can only offer coping strategies to adults. We need to accept our children are at risk and intervene early."""

Bhupesh Baghel overcame the challenge from his contemporary T S Singh Deo to become Congress chief minister of Chhattisgarh, capping a week-long party exercise to finalise the leadership of the state as well as of Rajasthan and MP where BJP was swept out of power on 11 December.

TOI had reported in its late editions on Sunday that Baghel was the front runner for the job. He is credited with leading the organisation during the last five years against BJP led by an entrenched three-term CM Raman Singh.

Amid claims of multiple leaders, Rahul Gandhi kept his focus on the primary consideration of Baghel's organisational stewardship, which, coupled with his experience as a minister in MP and Chhattisgarh, added to his profile as administrator.

2. Modi Slams Cong: No Quattrocchi Mama or Michel Uncle in Rafale Deal

In his first public remarks since the Supreme Court rejected judicial intervention in the Rafale deal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday targeted the Congress and said that the party is ""lying"" and is ""frustrated"" as there was no ""Quattrocchi mama"" or ""Christian Michel uncle"" in the NDA government's defence deals.

Addressing a rally in former Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's Lok Sabha constituency of Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh, just days after the BJP lost power to the Congress in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Modi questioned the Congress on why it did not strengthen the Air Force despite demands by the military after the Kargil war.

He said: ""Humare liye dal se bada desh hai...Inhe desh ki parwah nahi hai...Modi ko woh kisi bhi tarah ek daag laga dena chahte hain...Lekin uske liye desh ko taak pe kyon rakh diya gaya hai. (For us, the country is bigger than the party. They (Congress) do not care about the country, they just want to put a blot on Modi...they have put the country at stake for that).""

3. DMK Chief MK Stalin Proposes Rahul Gandhi as PM Face for 2019

DMK president MK Stalin on Sunday, 16 December, made a strong pitch for Rahul Gandhi as the Opposition's prime ministerial candidate for 2019, saying the Congress chief had the ability to oust the ""fascist"" Narendra Modi government.

""I propose Rahul Gandhi as PM. I urge other leaders present here to stand with me on this. We should support Rahul,"" he said. Taking a dig at the PM, Stalin said under the leadership of Modi, the country had gone back 15 years.

""Under Modi's leadership, the country has gone 15 years back. If we give him another chance, the country will surely go back to what it was 50 years ago,"" the DMK chief said at an event to inaugurate a statue of the party's late patriarch and ex-chief minister M Karunanidhi at Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (DMK) headquarters in Chennai.

4. Cyclone Phethai to Make Landfall in Andhra Pradesh Today, Alert Sounded

Phethai, the cyclone, over southwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal is very likely to intensify into a ""severe cyclonic storm"" during the next six hours and move north-northwest, and cross Andhra Pradesh coast around Kakinada on Monday afternoon, said the Cyclone Warning Centre at Visakhapatnam in its latest 4.35 pm bulletin on Sunday.

The cyclonic storm lay centred at 2.30 pm on Sunday at about 480 km southeast of Machilipatnam and 510 km south-southeast of Kakinada.

5. Army Versus Valley March

The army has vowed to foil a march called by the Hurriyat Conference to the force's Valley headquarters against the latest civilian killings in Kashmir as it braced for a showdown with separatist-backed protesters on Monday.

An army spokesperson said the force would thwart all such ""evil attempts of the terrorist-separatist-Pakistan nexus to pit the civilian population against security forces"".

Sunday's tough talk came a day after seven civilians died and dozens were injured in Sirnoo village in Pulwama, south Kashmir, when security forces fired on an unruly mob that had swarmed the streets to protest the death of three militants in a gunfight that broke out early in the morning. A soldier also died in the encounter.

6. Pak Infiltration Ops Shifting to Jammu Border: NIA

A National Investigation Agency (NIA) probe has revealed that in the last three years over 40 terrorists were pushed by Pakistan into India through the international border in Jammu, and then transported deep into the Kashmir Valley to carry out targeted strikes, said multiple government, intelligence and security officials familiar with the matter.

NIA has drawn its conclusion about the number of infiltrators after interrogating half-a-dozen overground workers (OWGs) - a nomenclature used by the J&K police for civilians who help militants - linked to Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), who were arrested over the past year, the officials added.

7. India Recorded 95 Tiger Deaths in 2018, 41 Outside Reserves

According to the National Tiger Conservation Authority's (NTCA) records till 15 December 2018, there were 95 cases of tiger deaths in the country. Of this, 41 cases of tiger deaths outside tiger reserves have been reported.

Of them, 14 occurred in Maharashtra, which accounted for over 34 percent of all deaths outside tiger reserves in the country. A total of 19 tiger deaths were recorded in Maharashtra in 2018, so deaths outside tiger reserves comprise more than 70 percent of all tiger deaths in the state.

The NTCA maintains the official database of tiger mortality in the country, and compiles figures from reports sent by different States on the basis of recovery of bodies or seizure of body parts.

8. Centre Revives Plan to Check E-tailers' Discounts, Freebies

The government has revived plans to put e-commerce players on a tight leash, including imposing checks on discounting and unbridled cashbacks and freebies, in a bid to clamp down on ""predatory behaviour"".

Sources told TOI that the commerce and industry ministry is looking at ways to strengthen the e-commerce sector while safeguarding the interests of domestic retailers.

Many of them are complaining about serious loss of business to ""adverse competition"" from e-tailers as well as the impact of demonetisation and goods and services tax. Lobby groups such as CAIT and Swadeshi Jagran Manch, an RSS affiliate, have taken up cudgels on behalf of local kirana and small shop owners.

9. Maharashtra to Give Leave to Male Staff for Childcare

Male employees of the state government are now entitled to childcare leaves in case their spouses are bed-ridden or incapacitated due to mental health problems and are unable to take care of the children.

The State government on 23 July issued directions on sanctioning childcare leave to male employees. As per the government resolution issued on 15 December, a male employee is eligible for leave for the exact period his wife is bedridden or is unable to take care of the children due to mental health problems.

Teaching and non-teaching staff of zilla parishads, government-approved and aided primary, secondary and higher secondary schools, agriculture and non-agriculture universities and full-time teaching and non-teaching staff from the colleges affiliated to those universities also come within its purview.

The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) responsible for holding Class V exams has hinted that since the model code of conduct was in place since October, the examination process for about 20 lakh students has slowed down.

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

""It has certainly affected the process but I am sure that teachers will complete the curriculum on time. Examination forms are being submitted in schools for both classes,"" said Arunesh Sinha, director of DIET, Jaipur.

Some officials shared the inside story. ""Since the model code of conduct is in place since October, the decision-making has become extremely slow. The system will not normalise until the new government is formed. Other than human resources, huge financial resources are also required to conduct these exams which are bigger in volume than the class X and XII exams,"" said an official.

Exams for classes V, VIII will take place after class X and XII boards in April.

Any delay will push the exams to May which has unbearable climatic conditions.

Meanwhile, Kishan Mittal, spokesperson of Swayamsewi Shiksha Sansthan, a body of RBSE schools, has argued that English books for upper primary classes for this year are yet to be distributed in government schools.

""Students are forced to purchase books from the market. It needs to be probed that when order for the books was placed at the beginning of the year, why have they not reached schools,"" said Mittal."
"290","1020067391","2018-12-17","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/food-for-thought-veg-non-veg-divide-enters-kolkata-classrooms/articleshow/67120633.cms","Food for thought: Veg-non-veg divide enters Kolkata classrooms - Times of India","The Times of India",FALSE,"KOLKATA: A recent scrap between Class VI boys of a prominent central Kolkata school, which went viral for a few days on parents' WhatsApp groups and forced the school to intervene, has brought to the fore the vegetarian versus non-vegetarian divide brewing in tiffin boxes and classrooms.

The row was sparked by a student sharing a chicken sandwich with some of his classmates, who happened to be vegetarians, during the tiffin break. Others in the class then roughed up this student, who claimed he did not know that his classmates were vegetarian, and parents got involved. The school authorities had to issue a notice asking students not to share non-vegetarian food in class.

This school may have somehow managed to resolve this incident peacefully but school authorities across the city acknowledge that they have a problem on their hand. The debate on the contents of the tiffin box may have followed the wider vegetariannon-vegetarian social and political debate, say leading schools, forcing many to frame guidelines on food.

Some schools have explicitly asked students to avoid bringing non-vegetarian food to class, but others have preferred to avoid a stricture, choosing instead to prohibit consumption of meat, fish and eggs only within classrooms; yet others have asked students to declare the contents of their tiffin box before sharing it with classmates.

A leading English-medium girls' school near Park Circus, for example, has given out a list of suggested food items that students of junior classes can bring to campus. This list does not have any non-vegetarian item though the school has insisted to parents that it ""is not forcing anything on students but merely suggesting something"". Students and parents, however, say carrying non-vegetarian food to school often evokes snide remarks and even bullying. That this problem has not had a resolution is clear from the school's request to stay ""off record while it tries to bring out a solution"".

Don Bosco (Park Circus), too, does not allow non-vegetarian food till Class II. ""Students of other classes are told to not share their food if it is not vegetarian. Students from Class VI onward can buy food from the canteen,"" principal Father Bikash Mondal said.

Food packets distributed by the school, during school events or celebrations, are strictly vegetarian, which is the practice followed by an overwhelming majority of other city schools. Rammohan Mission School, too, ""does not bar non-veg stuff but sticks to vegetarian food for school programmes"", says principal Sujoy Biswas.

Tiffin Row

Parents tense despite advisory

One of the city's oldest Catholic girls' schools in central Kolkata encourages students to have non-veg food at the canteen rather than bring it from home. Girls are not barred from having non-vegetarian food on campus, but the school makes it clear that it would rather students avoid them in classrooms. ""This preempts confusion and conflict,"" a senior member of the management said.

Another new-age school off EM Bypass-Rashbehari Connector has asked students to disclose the nature of the food they share with classmates. A parent says it has worked out well. Another school of the same group has asked parents to put stickers on tiffin boxes if they contain non-vegetarian food; it has also asked students bringing non-vegetarian food ""to move away from vegetarians"" before opening their lunch boxes.

But some parents of the school where the sandwichsharing controversy happened continue to remain tense despite the school issuing a similar advisory. ""Senior students, too, have fought over non-veg food recently. I now make sure that my son doesn't carry non-vegetarian stuff to school,"" the parent of a Class IX student said.

Modern High School for Girls director Devi Kar believes supervision is necessary to preempt such controversies. ""We closely monitor primary section students' food. There is no bar on nonvegetarian food but our canteen is vegetarian,"" she added.

There are some others, like The Heritage School, which forbid non-veg food on campus, ""but not because of any recent controversy"". ""We are a vegetarian school. We have a dietician and it is mandatory for students to have food from canteen. Around 700 children have breakfast and lunch along with teachers and no one is allowed to carry food from home,"" principal Seema Sapru said."
"291","1020007144","2018-12-16","https://www.deccanherald.com/international/jj-knew-decades-asbestos-708326.html","J&J knew for decades about asbestos in talcs","Deccan Herald",FALSE,"Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.

She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.

Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? ""She wanted answers,"" her daughter Cady Evans said.

Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson's Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognize the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""

Eight years after the launch of Pragna, an ""activity-based learning"", in the government primary schools of Gujarat, the project has been considerably scaled down. After spending Rs 150 crore and conducting a series of training sessions for over 80,000 teachers till 2017, the project will be limited to only Class I and II from this year, instead of Class I to V as it was being executed till now.

The Gujarat Council of Educational Research and Training (GCERT) has termed the decision to scale down the project with an aim to universalise it.

""The move to remove Pragna from Class III to V, and scale it down to all Class I and II, is aimed at universalising it. This was necessary for its better implementation,"" GCERT Director T S Joshi told The Indian Express, pointing to the project now being introduced in across 33,000-odd government primary schools. Till date, Pragna covered nearly 23,000 government primary schools.

However, primary teachers' resentment against the ""complicated teaching methodology"" under Pragna cannot be ruled out for the decision to scale it down.

Advertising

Teachers have resisted the project on several grounds, ranging from difficulty in ""maintaining order"" in classrooms, grouping of different classes in one room causing attention deficit, to ""additional workload"" on them.

This is clearly stated in the survey report prepared and submitted by the Gujarat Evaluation Department under General Administrative Department (GAD) in 2017. The teachers had said in their response, ""It becomes difficult to assign different activities to children within the same group as students are at different milestones"".

EXPLAINED Why Gujarat grapples with improving learning levels

The Gujarat government has been struggling to improve the learning levels of the children in its schools. It has rolled out several measures for it -- from evaluation exercise like Gunotsav to enrolment drive Praveshotsav and Mission Vidya. Despite many quality improvement projects, the learning levels of students remains low as highlighted by the findings of the National Achievement Survey that was released by the Centre's HRD Ministry earlier this year. One reason could be lack of consistency in implementing such schemes. For example, the evaluation part of Praveshotsav continued for only two years, while Mission Vidya ended abruptly despite initial plans to replicate it to lower classes.

A typical Pragna classroom has floor seating, instead of the row-column wise desk-chair seating arrangement. The children are divided into four groups and seated on dhurries encircling bright red coloured angular tables joined to make a small circle, doing their own activity.

""The previous traditional blackboard and desk-chair system was far better than this floor seating as now I alone have to handle nearly 40 students of both Class I and II where half the class has been taught as per the traditional teaching for a year and are now following this new one. Also, since the post of teacher for Class II is vacant I have to teach the entire class,"" said one of the teachers of a municipal corporation school in Ahmedabad, on condition of anonymity.

Based on teachers' complaints of ""extra load"", the project has incorporated several major changes in its curriculum, methodology, thereby simplifying the process. The system had its own specially-designed curriculum and was followed for the last seven years. Now, it has been replaced by curriculum of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).

Moreover, the number of groups in which the students were categorised based on their learning levels have been reduced from six to four, and only two subjects -- Gujarati and Mathematics -- instead of existing four -- language, EVS, mathematics and rainbow activities -- will be taught now.

The six groups in which Class I and II students were initially categorised were teacher supported group, partially teacher supported group, peer support group, partial peer support group, self learning group and evaluation group. Now, partially teacher supported group and partial peer support group have been done away with.

The number of cards used to teach students has also been reduced as teachers complained that ""students of Class I and II are young and it becomes difficult to select a card and divide in groups"".

Nearly 10,000 schools, where Pragna has been introduced for the first time, are struggling to catch up with the drastic change. Since both Class I and II are clubbed together under the project, Class II students have been made to shift to the new method of learning without studying in the same format in Class I."
