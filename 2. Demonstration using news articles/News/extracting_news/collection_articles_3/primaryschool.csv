Excelsior Sports Correspondent

JAMMU, Dec 31: Former Minister and Congress leader Sh Sham Lal Sharma said that schools should focus on moral values rather than mere education to the students.

Z.P.E.O Akhnoor) and from the Management of School, Raman Gupta and Aradhana Mahajan.

Sharma in his speech strongly advocated for change in the present educational set up and suggested to introduce moral education subject in every school from primary level. He said parents and teachers have also greater role to play in this direction and they must instil the moral ethics and rich ethos of Indian culture in the students so that they become good citizens and contribute for the welfare of the society and nation. He said on the eve of New Year ""we all should take a pledge to save the Girl Child and raise our voice against the crimes against the females and to contribute for a healthy and prosperous society"".

He asked teachers that while nurturing the students to achieve new highs in science, technology and modern studies, equal attention is paid to outdoor activities like sports, travel, etc which enables physical and mental development of the child."

They got together, cleaned and repainted the school, and also installed new green boards in the classrooms.

Speaking about the initiative, V Kamalesh, 24, who studied in the school from 1999 to 2003, said they had formed a volunteer forum called 'Young Heartz' through which they do philanthropic activities every New Year. ""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

Headmistress C Rajam said the school now has 121 students in five classes. ""The numbers have fallen by 50 to 60 after 2001, as this is a Tamil medium school and people are after English medium schools. But our school has a trackrecord of inculcating values along with education,"" she said. ""In 2017, I was honoured with the Dr Radhakrishnan Award for the best teacher in recognition of the school's service to students.""

Alumni too vouch for the school's legacy. ""Most of the people from the area would have done their primary schooling here and now they are in several respectable positions,"" said Kamalesh.

The youngsters plan to buy new furniture for the school and will soon start collecting funds for it."

It will be rolled out on an experimental basis for the primary students of classes 5 and 6 in the first phase, Ganjam District Collector, Vijay Amruta Kulange, said.

The online teaching through smartphones in Odia medium schools is Kulange's brainchild.

The district administration has started preparation to record some of the best classes taken by teachers in various subjects in primary sections, which will be available on YouTube and WhatsApp, the official said.

""If things move smoothly, the system will be available by the end of February 2019,"" Kulange said.

Since most of the students are cell phone savvy and mobile phones are available in almost all households, this method of online learning will help students in their home studies, Kulange said.

This would also help them to learn about the subjects taught in classrooms when they remain absent, he said.

""Not only the students of Ganjam, it will also be shared with students of other districts,"" he said.

The online education will be an additional input to the students besides classroom education, said district education officer (DEO), Ganjam Sanatan Panda.

In the first phase, the administration wants to rollout subjects such as science and mathematics. I

Some of the classroom teachings of several teachers have already been recorded. More such classes would also be recorded in the coming days in different subjects by the teachers, sources said.

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

In 2015, the basic education department had converted a few primary schools of Uttar Pradesh into English medium institutions. The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

Hariyali Srivastava, assistant teacher at primary school Gejha, said the problem was that most students coming to government-run primary schools hailed from humble backgrounds. ""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

Making an appeal to senior officials in the basic education department, Srivastava said, ""The students have learnt all terminology in English. Now, they will have to study in Hindi medium upper primary schools, which will be very difficult for them. Our students are asking for help. They want schools to be made English medium till Class 10.""

Chhavi Agarwal, assistant teacher of another primary school, said she teaches 280 students. ""Similar requests are pouring in from my students too.""

Lucknow BSA Amar Kant Singh agreed with the teachers and said that the demand for English medium schools after Class 5 was ""quite natural"". ""After studying in English medium institutions, students will not like to go back to Hindi medium schools,"" he said.

A senior basic education department official added that they were aware of the growing demand for government-run English medium schools and were looking into the matter."

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

A primary school in Kaushambi district of Prayagraj is using the popular 'Snakes and Ladders' board game to create awareness among students regarding the importance of looking beyond usual vocations while choosing their career path.

Teachers at the Primary School Perai are using the game to motivate students to be successful in life by climbing the simple ladder of hard work, without worrying too much about the hurdles -- represented by snakes. They are especially encouraging students to dream big and think beyond the professions of their parents.

In this rural area, most students hail from a humble background. Someone's father is a plumber, someone else's a carpenter, mason or daily wager. The school authorities are trying to help these children look beyond these professions that would fetch them only a meagre income.

""We help our Class 5 students aspire for more in life instead of settling for small goals. With the 'Snakes and Ladders' board game, we create awareness among them about professions of teaching, medicine and engineering, which could make their lives prosperous and help them turn around their family's fortunes,"" said principal Hari Om Singh.

""The game is simple. Rules are similar to the traditional 'Snakes and Ladders', with some additional interesting information shared to benefit the students and retain their interest. Children are told not to get disheartened if they slip down due to a 'snake bite', for they need to remember that there is always the 'ladder' of hard work available to help them make it to the top,"" the teacher explained further.

He said the idea was to make students aware of the professions they would normally not think about on account of their rural background and tender age.

""The game is very interesting,"" said Tej Singh, a Class 5 student whose father runs a shop. ""We learn so much more about professions such as being a bureaucrat, cartoonist, animator, teacher, doctor and engineer,"" he said.

Another student Manu Singh said, ""It is great fun to play the game with friends and get information about new things at the same time. We learnt a lot from this drill, especially about the various career options open for us."""

Both students and teachers sit on the ground. A total of 33 students including 18 girls study in the school.

Locals said though '50,000 was sanctioned by the State Government for construction of a permanent building, the school authorities could not utilise it as the piece of land originally belonged to Majhi, a Scheduled Tribe. As per land laws, SC/ST land can't be acquired by the Government or any other community. Parents and villagers had met the higher officials to find a way out but nothing has materialised yet.

Ramay Marandi, a villager, said despite several requests to the Block Education Officer, District Project Coordinator of SSA, the Collector and MLA Maharaja Prabin Chandra Bhanjdeo for construction of a building, no step has been taken. During rainy season, villagers hesitate to send their kids to the school which remains closed for most of the days, he added.

Headmistress Salma Hembram said, ""The State Government had provided financial assistance of '50,000 for a building. But, it remained unspent for several years and later we returned the fund. Though the kin of late Shymsundar Majhi had given no-objection certificate (NOC) through an affidavit on the land, the block education officials are yet to take steps in this regard.""

When contacted, District Education Officer (DEO) Dhruba Charan Behera said due to land dispute, the district administration has failed to construct the school building. Steps are being taken to resolve the issue for larger interest of school students, he added.

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

English medium in govt schools will not harm Tamil

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here. In fact, admissions in the nearby corporation, and even private, schools have come down because of this."

The SC/ST/OBC teachers' forum in the national Capital has demanded the removal of the chairperson of the board that conducts recruitment exams for the Delhi government over a question involving a derogatory term referring to a particular community.

The Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) had allegedly included the controversial question in an exam conducted on Saturday for hiring primary teachers.

According to candidates who wrote the exam, the Hindi section of all the four sets of the question paper had a 'casteist question'. ""I was aghast to see the question. Use of such language in an exam for recruiting teachers shows the deeply entrenched casteism among people sitting in the authority,"" a candidate, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

Though Aasim is worried that he already missed two months of school, he confidently says he will continue the legal battle till justice is done. ""I am sure I will get justice. If the school gets upgraded to a high school, it will benefit not only me, but also several students from our region,"" he said.

Aasim, who has 90 per cent disability, completed his Class 7 from the Government Upper Primary School, Velimanna.

Born without hands, Aasim has trained himself to write with his feet. He has disabilities with his legs too.

After many ups and downs, Aasim's chances of continuing his schooling brightened after the High Court directed the Education Department on June 11 to ensure facilities for his higher studies within two weeks.

Aasim's father Muhammed Saeed had filed a petition in the court seeking a direction to the state government to upgrade the upper primary school to a high school and start Class 8 this year itself.

The High Court had dismissed 134 similar petitions for upgradations of schools across the state the same day. But, the government moved the High Court against the order passed by a single-judge bench.

Aasim needs his parents' help to meet his basic needs. Aasim is the eldest among the couple's children and there are four other kids too.

""The little kids study in cramped conditions due to lack of a proper school building. There is a middle school, but for high school, students have to study at Semmanchery where there are a good number of students studying already,"" said a source at Perumbakkam.

Settlements in Gudapakkam and Navallur (near Padappai) face similar issues due to lack of initiatives taken by the TNSCB in concurrence with the district administration and education department to improve schooling for resettled students. The report also highlighted lack of access to proper means of livelihood, besides sub-standard quality of houses. Almost all tenements were devoid of water supply. Access to monthly ration and healthcare too was irregular for the residents. Concerns about safety of women and girls fell on deaf ears, the report said.

An official from the Integrated Cooum River Eco-Restoration Project said several departments are collectively involved in the functioning of these tenements and a detailed report would be presented to the HC. ""School buildings in Perumbakkam are under construction. We have asked the education department to upgrade the middle school to high school,"" said the official."

Initially, reports about one school -- Navalpur primary school - had come but after a probe it was found that four more schools were following the same practice in the district.

Notably, all the five schools had word 'Islamia' prefixed to their name on the sign board and the entire documentation of the schools records was done in Urdu.

On getting the information, Deoria Basic Shiksha Adhikari (BSA) Santosh Dev Pandey visited all the primary schools in Swami Patti, Karmaha and Pokharbhinda Prasad villages of Rampur Karkhana block, and one in Haraiya village of Desahi block and got their names repainted.

""On Monday, I inspected all five schools. The correct names have been painted on all five buildings. They have been told to follow all rules and regulations,"" said Pandey.

The BSA added that the principals of all the five primary schools were taken to task and were directed to run the schools as per the laid down guidelines, rule and regulations.

""They have been told that if found flouting the rules, strict action will be taken against them,"" the BSA said. As per the BSA, while visiting the schools, only seven students were found to be enrolled in Pokharbhinda Prasad school, which has Samiuddin as principal and one assistant teacher.

""We have entered into an agreement with an NGO under which they will cut hair of primary school students for free. The programme will begin later this month or in the first week of August,"" L D Desai, Administrative Officer of AMC School Board, told PTI.

He said the consent of the students and their parents would be sought, adding that men will give haircuts to boys and women to girls.

""We have started taking written permission from them as only those who agree to it will be eligible for the free haircut. Fifty per cent of students and their parents have agreed,"" Desai informed.

He said that the primary objectives behind the move, as part of the 'Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur' (a step towards cleanliness) initiative, was to inculcate clean habits among students and also to ensure parents of students, many of whom hail from slums, save money on regular haircuts.

""Most of our school students come from the slum areas and they do not receive regular haircuts for various reasons. The minimum cost of a haircut in Ahmedabad is Rs 70 and we believe this programme will allow the parents of these students to save money,"" he said.

A barber was recently assaulted in Mehsana district's Satlasana village after he refused to pay heed to diktats from the upper caste people to not cut the hair of those belonging to the backward castes.

Desai, however, maintained that in the city and in municipal schools, no was discriminated on the basis of their castes.

""For us every child is equal,"" he said.

Officials said that chances of boys opting for the scheme would be higher since most parents wanted their girls to have long hair."

Here are some hilarious books that will get them hooked to the reading habit!

By Arundhati Venkatesh

""Laughter is the reward that lures the most reluctant reader,"" said researcher Michele Landsberg.

Humour and children seem to go hand in hand. Here are five seriously funny chapter books for young readers:

Abhay and Nitya go hunting for monsters in their friends' rooms, but they end up finding all sorts of things instead, even a rat! The characters are full of spunk; Abhay's father with his theories on the moon landing is my favourite, and the wacky illustrations add to the fun. The book is part of the hole series published by Duckbill, a set of early chapter books with large font sizes and delightful illustrations. At around 70 pages, the books are not intimidating. Perfect for those taking their first steps in the world of chapter books.

Another of the Duckbill hOle books, this one has food, secret societies and a gang of friends. Pushkin aka Petu Pumpkin is always eating. When he starts emptying his friends' tiffin boxes, they form a secret society to save their lunches. But the magic potion is a flop and the superglue is a disaster ... Read the book to find out the rest. (Full disclosure: This is one of my books!)

There are more books in the Petu series:

Petu Pumpkin: Tooth Troubles is about shaky teeth, a football match, letters to the tooth fairy and escapades involving dogs.

Petu Pumpkin: Cheater Peter will be in bookstores in August 2018.

Charlie is five, and eats things that shouldn't be eaten, like paper and the sleeves of his shirts. And he is about to start school! An easy-breezy read featuring Charlie, his big brother Max and best friend Henry.

Moin finds a monster under his bed; one that sings silly songs, eats basket loads of bananas, and keeps making up (convenient) monster rules. In a hilarious turn of events, the monster accompanies Moin to school. Kooki's (the Principal, K.K. Kuttykrishnan) encounter with the monster and the ensuing chapter, aptly titled Kooki goes Cuckoo, had me chuckling. Be prepared for some offkey singing by your own little monsters, and don't be surprised if there are requests for banana burgers. There's a funny sequel too -- Moin the Monster Songster.

""No beard and no slippers. All primary teachers will now have to come to school after proper shaving and in formal dress with shoes on.

""We have to compete with private schools. We are having the largest pool of teachers and students but we lag behind because no work culture was developed and followed in government primary schools. Now onwards, we have to bring in qualitative changes in primary schools by adopting newer teaching and administrative methods to run them professionally,"" said he.

Dr Kumar also directed to screen primary teachers above 50 and submit a list to him within a month for taking a decision on their VRS. He also scrapped the contractual system of hiring teachers introduced by the erstwhile Akhilesh Yadav government. ""Corruption in the department will not be tolerated.

Currently, there are 6,600 teachers in regular employment of the corporation, the official said. Total number of students enrolled in its schools as on Monday stood at 2,56,000.

According to the Right to Education Act, schools are supposed to have one teacher for every 40 students. This means, for the current number of students, 6,400 teachers are required. That is, 200 less than the total number of regular teachers employed.

'Numbers are faulty'

""The corporation's numbers are faulty,"" said Jitendra Verma, member of Samvida Shikshak Parivar Kalyan Samiti -- a contract teachers union member, who met North Corporation Mayor Adesh Gupta on Wednesday.

""About 450 teachers are getting promoted through the Trained Graduate Teacher [TGT] mode and they have sent a notification for the recruitment of 1,490 teachers through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board [DSSSB], then how can they say there is no vacancy,"" asked Kamaljit Singh, a member of the teachers union. ""Many of us have been working at these posts for the past 13-14 years. Where are we supposed to go now,"" he asked.

Expect a rise in students

By the end of August, when enrolment is typically at its highest, the corporation expects the total number of students to rise by 2,78,000.

This would take the number of required teachers to 6,950. Which means, contracts of at least about half of the teachers, finding themselves unemployed will likely be renewed.

The demand for teachers has also seen a drop because fewer students are being enrolled in corporation schools.

For instance, as of August last year, the total number of students enrolled were 2,98,000. That is, 20,000 more than the total number of students expected to enrol this year.

The North Corporation Mayor said, ""The facts being brought forward by the officials and the union are at odds and need to be examined. A decision will be taken based on the interests of everyone involved."""

During a visit on Saturday, there were only nine students, including one student each for first class and fifth class. The lone teacher, who is also headmistress of the school, conducts classes for all the students in a single room.

Incidentally, the district authorities have posted an office subordinate male (attender) to this primary school to open and close the single classroom. The authorities were planning to fill up two vacant SGT posts in the school during this present ongoing transfer and counselling programme.

The locals suggested that the government close down the primary school and shift the students into nearby Government High School in Savaran Street in the same locality. They pointed out that the government had already closed more than 127 primary schools in the erstwhile Karimnagar district which had enrolment of below 20 students as per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) survey.

Running of a school without students by paying salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff was a waste of taxpayer's money, Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district president N. Srinivas said.

Due to busy road, the students were confined to the classroom and there is no play and other recreational activities, she said and added that the admissions would increase into the school if there was a compound wall around the school.

Telangana Rashtra Teachers Federation (TRTF) district president M. Prathap Reddy was of the opinion that the government teachers were not meeting the expectations of the parents of the students on par with their private counterparts.

At a time when most government school authorities complain of lack of resources, the principal of the primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki has formed students' music bands in his institute.

Both the boys' and the girls' bands, introduced a few months ago, have 12 members each. They play on special occasions, such as, the Republic Day, the Independence Day and others. Members sport vibrant uniforms, as they play snare drum, bass drum, trumpet and flute, setting a benchmark for other primary schools.

""I carefully picked their outfit, which includes a green T-shirt, a white half pant/skirt, white shoes, a tri-coloured cap and a scarf, to exude an aura of patriotism,"" said principal Sushil Kumar.

From introducing smart classes to the music bands, Kumar is leaving no stone unturned in transforming the school's image into that of a model school. ""I saw how in private schools, enthusiastic children took out Republic Day processions on the symphony of ensembles. I wanted that for our kids here as well,"" he said.

Eleven-year-old Man Singh, who is on the bass drum, said, ""It is a wonderful experience. We get to dress differently and perform in public."" Another student, Sachin Kumar, 10, who is on the snare drum, added, ""I feel happy when we perform and the spectators appreciate us."" Their training was facilitated by district scout master Rajendra Tripathi.

Eager to bring about a change, Kumar said he bought the musical instruments using the money received as part of the 'Excellent School Award' won by the institute during the Akhilesh Yadav regime.

School teacher Jyoti Rawat, 33, said, ""On hearing about an upcoming event, children get ecstatic. Performing in front of their parents and relatives make them feel they are doing something extraordinary.""

Showering praise on the Kumar's initiative, Skand Shukla, deputy secretary, director basic shiksha parishad, Allahabad, said, ""This initiative of forming music band in a government run primary school is a shining example for other school principals to replicate. It will make education more fun.""

The school is technologically equipped with a projector, laptops and computers. Little wonder then that the student attendance is as high as 80% and the number of enrolments have gone up from 119 to 160. In April, this year, the school also got recognised as an English medium school, which is helping attract students even from private schools, said school authorities.

""The government and various NGOs helped this school in many ways, such as, providing furniture, laptops, computers and drinking water facilities among others,"" said Kumar, who was felicitated with the national Information and Communication Technology award in 2017.

He also used crowd funding on Facebook to get money to upgrade the infrastructure. Acknowledging the community's support, Kumar said, ""Computers were given to us by the Baba Amarnath Sewa Mandal, sports equipment came from community members, furniture came from Govind Industry, and mid day meals are provided by the government.""

""Out of five classes, two are furnished with tables and chairs. For the others, we will arrange furniture soon. Our premises are also very clean, as much emphasis is placed on personal and environmental hygiene. I am working on providing maximum learning to students through minimum investment.

The education department has initiated inquiries against two teachers of the government primary school at Jaspur in Udham Singh Nagar district ""for indiscipline"".

A letter has also been written to the higher authorities for stopping their salaries, said Anil Kumar, the block education officer (BEO).

The action against the teachers comes after Jaspur MLA Adesh Chauhan conducted a sudden inspection at the school on Thursday.

Chauhan said that there were complaints against the teachers. ""Villagers had complained to me that a teacher of the government primary school at Jaspur comes school daily, but after signing the attendance register, he starts boozing instead of teaching. He comes late and leaves before the school is over,"" he said.

When Chauhan visited the school on Thursday, the students told him that the teacher brings liquor with him and drinks regularly. They showed a heap of empty liquor bottles behind the school.

Another teacher of the school is absent since March, but drawing salary regularly. ""When I visited, I found the school closed. Villagers called the student who keeps the school key.

The survey reveals that the number of children attending Class 1 to 8 had fallen from 16.17 million in the academic year 2014-15 to 15.91 million in 2017-18 - a drop of 1.6%. The enrolment at secondary and higher secondary level (Class 9 to 12) went up by 7.6%, from 6.18 million to 6.64 million over the same period.

Experts have not been able to identify the exact reasons behind the drop in the number of children in primary school; they have implied that the fall in the number of children in primary schools could be because of rising dropout rates and a dip in fertility rates. Though India is ensuring that a larger proportion of children remain in school, dropout rates are still a concern. A study titled 'School Dropouts: Examining the space of reasons' authored by Arun NR Kishore and KS Shaji, published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, says that in 1993, 27 million children were enrolled in Class I in schools across the country. In 2003, only 10 m of these children (one in three) reached Class 10.

Two separate sets of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) can explain the fall in the number of children in primary schools. The NFHS 4 for 2015-16, released last year, says that the number of children below 15 years, as a percentage of the total population of Maharashtra, fell to 24.5% in 2015-16 compared to 30.6% in 2005-2006 when NFHS 3 was compiled. Similarly, the fertility rate - the number of children born to a woman - has declined from 2.1 to 1.9 between the periods of the two surveys.

During this period, the state's population has grown, though moderately, and NHFS data does not indicate whether this fall in proportion of under-15 in the state's population has also resulted in a decline in absolute numbers. But data from the national population census reveal that the absolute number of children are also declining. The state's child population (in this case, children up to six years) was 13.32 million in 2011 - a decline of around 345,000 from the earlier population count in 2001. As a percentage of the total population, the proportion of children up to six years has dropped from 17.1% in 1991 to 14.1% in 2001, falling further to 11.9% in 2011. The proportion could be below 10% now if the trend has continued.

All these data suggest that women in Maharashtra are having fewer children, resulting in the drop in the number of students in primary schools. Data on school enrolment also suggest that the decline in number of students in primary schools could be because of a drop in the absolute numbers for that age group. A study of over 100,000 households, conducted last year by the Maharashtra government, found that 99.3 per cent children in age group 6-14 years were attending school.

The changes in Maharashtra's child demographics follow trends in other parts of the country. The NFHS shows that in Kerala, the proportion of children below 15 years fell from 24.4% of the population in 2005-06 to 20.2% in 2015-16. Even in Bihar, where fertility rates are still high - though it fell from 4 in 2005-2006 to 3.4 in 2015-16, the proportion of under-15 fell from 43.8% to 39.3 during the same period.

Education experts have said that when there is a drop in the number of students in schools because of demographic changes, there is an opportunity to improve facilities in schools as the per-capita spend (money spent on each child) on education goes up, with opportunities to pursue a lower student-teacher ratio and better infrastructure.

Of course, teaching and learning standards, especially in schools run by the state government and municipal corporations, continue to be abysmal. The Annual Status of Education (ASER) survey showed that only 27% of students in Class 8 can read Class 2-level texts and 31% of Class 8 students can do the simple mathematical exercise of dividing numbers."

""This year, we decided to help our school. About 25 old students from various batches got together and started collecting funds for the cause,"" he said.

The alumni members shared their initiative on social media platforms, which helped them connect with more old classmates. Eventually, they were able to collect about Rs 70,000, said Kamalesh.

The youngsters started the work on December 23 and completed it on Monday, said M Gopinath, 24, another alumni member.

Their main motive, the youngsters said, was to improve the student enrolment. ""While we were students, the school, which had Classes I to V, had two sections in each class. Now there is only one section and the strength has come down. We want to improve the situation,"" said Kamalesh.

Headmistress C Rajam said the school now has 121 students in five classes.

Students enrolled in government-run English medium primary schools say they do not want to switch over to Hindi as a medium when they begin lessons in upper primary school after finishing Class 5. Their demand to convert some of the upper primary schools from Hindi to English medium is growing louder with every passing day.

Kajal Kumari, a student of English medium primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar said, ""Switching back to Hindi will not be easy. I request the authorities to please do something so that we may continue to study in English after passing Class 5. It is through a lot of hard work that we developed a comfort level in studying in English. Now, if we go back to learning lessons in Hindi, it will undo whatever we learnt over the past few years.""

The primary school Gejha in Gautam Buddh Nagar was also made English medium at this time. It has 434 students enrolled in it and most of them do not wish to switch over to a Hindi medium school.

Officials said that after seeing the craze for English-medium schools growing in the state, the BJP government decided to convert 5,000 primary schools to English-medium ones from the April 2018 session. At present, 4,97,108 students are studying in these government-run primary schools.

""In Lucknow alone, there are 44 such schools where more than 6,200 students are enrolled,"" said Amar Kant Singh, Basic Shiksha Adhikari, Lucknow.

""Their parents can't afford to send them to private English medium schools in Class 6, as the fee is very high,"" she said.

Corroborating what the teacher said, Kajal added, ""I want to study only in a government-run English medium school because my father (an e-rickshaw driver) can't afford to pay the fees charged by private English medium schools.""

Zainab Khatoon, another Class 5 girl of the same school, said that she wanted the state government to intervene in the matter.

The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

A primary school in Kaushambi district of Prayagraj is using the popular 'Snakes and Ladders' board game to create awareness among students regarding the importance of looking beyond usual vocations while choosing their career path.

Teachers at the Primary School Perai are using the game to motivate students to be successful in life by climbing the simple ladder of hard work, without worrying too much about the hurdles -- represented by snakes.

In this rural area, most students hail from a humble background. Someone's father is a plumber, someone else's a carpenter, mason or daily wager. The school authorities are trying to help these children look beyond these professions that would fetch them only a meagre income.

""We help our Class 5 students aspire for more in life instead of settling for small goals. With the 'Snakes and Ladders' board game, we create awareness among them about professions of teaching, medicine and engineering, which could make their lives prosperous and help them turn around their family's fortunes,"" said principal Hari Om Singh.

""The game is simple. Rules are similar to the traditional 'Snakes and Ladders', with some additional interesting information shared to benefit the students and retain their interest. Children are told not to get disheartened if they slip down due to a 'snake bite', for they need to remember that there is always the 'ladder' of hard work available to help them make it to the top,"" the teacher explained further.

He said the idea was to make students aware of the professions they would normally not think about on account of their rural background and tender age.

""The game is very interesting,"" said Tej Singh, a Class 5 student whose father runs a shop. ""We learn so much more about professions such as being a bureaucrat, cartoonist, animator, teacher, doctor and engineer,"" he said.

Lacking a building of its own, the primary school has been running from the shade since 2002 after a tribal villager Shymasundar Majhi donated six decimal land. Both students and teachers sit on the ground. A total of 33 students including 18 girls study in the school.

Locals said though '50,000 was sanctioned by the State Government for construction of a permanent building, the school authorities could not utilise it as the piece of land originally belonged to Majhi, a Scheduled Tribe. As per land laws, SC/ST land can't be acquired by the Government or any other community. Parents and villagers had met the higher officials to find a way out but nothing has materialised yet.

Ramay Marandi, a villager, said despite several requests to the Block Education Officer, District Project Coordinator of SSA, the Collector and MLA Maharaja Prabin Chandra Bhanjdeo for construction of a building, no step has been taken. During rainy season, villagers hesitate to send their kids to the school which remains closed for most of the days, he added.

Headmistress Salma Hembram said, ""The State Government had provided financial assistance of '50,000 for a building. But, it remained unspent for several years and later we returned the fund. Though the kin of late Shymsundar Majhi had given no-objection certificate (NOC) through an affidavit on the land, the block education officials are yet to take steps in this regard.""

When contacted, District Education Officer (DEO) Dhruba Charan Behera said due to land dispute, the district administration has failed to construct the school building. Steps are being taken to resolve the issue for larger interest of school students, he added.

According to sources, Shrishapal school is not the solitary example in the district which has several pockets where primary education is in a shambles despite money in crores being spent for infrastructure and a host of schemes being launched for this sector."

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

English medium in govt schools will not harm Tamil

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here. In fact, admissions in the nearby corporation, and even private, schools have come down because of this."

The Trust, which runs a group of hotels, ploughs all its profits into charitable activities and as part of this, recently donated books to the Library of the school. The Trust is working in co-ordination with RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme), a voluntary Non-Government Organisation (NGO) that identifies the beneficiaries for such programmes.

The Head Mistress of the School Syeda Sadaq Unissa welcomed the team and showed them around the school. She said that the school is run in a rented building with 93 children from standard one to seven studying.

The SC/ST/OBC teachers' forum in the national Capital has demanded the removal of the chairperson of the board that conducts recruitment exams for the Delhi government over a question involving a derogatory term referring to a particular community.

The Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board (DSSSB) had allegedly included the controversial question in an exam conducted on Saturday for hiring primary teachers.

According to candidates who wrote the exam, the Hindi section of all the four sets of the question paper had a 'casteist question'. ""I was aghast to see the question. Use of such language in an exam for recruiting teachers shows the deeply entrenched casteism among people sitting in the authority,"" a candidate, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

Another candidate said that by asking such questions, the board has ""hurt the sentiments of their community"". ""We are upset over the insensitivity of the board and we demand an apology from them. It's highly irresponsible of them to use such casteist language in a teachers' recruitment exam,"" he said.

The DSSSB, however, cited 'inadvertent error' behind the incident. ""It has been brought to the notice of the DSSSB that in the recent recruitment exam for the post of MCD primary teachers, a question having casteist undertone appeared due to an inadvertent error. It is clarified that the procedure of paper setting is highly confidential and secretive in nature and the contents of the paper are not shared with the board officials. The contents of the paper are revealed for the very first time before the candidates only,"" the board said in a statement.

The members of SC/ST/OBC teachers' forum on Sunday wrote to the President, the Prime Minister, Union home minister, Delhi education minister and lieutenant governor demanding removal of DSSSB chairperson. ""We demand immediate action against the chairperson and also an assurance that such insensitivity will not be repeated in the future. Otherwise, we will launch a massive protest,"" said Hansraj Suman, a member of the forum. The forum has also called an emergency meeting on Tuesday.

He accused the board of 'deliberately' using the remark. ""The board could have used any question from the wide literature available in Hindi language. But they instead put a caste-based question in the paper. It only exposed their mentality,"" said Suman.

The board holds teachers' recruitment exam for government schools in Delhi.

Delhi SC/ST welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam also condemned the incident and demanded an explanation from the board. ""I will meet the Delhi Chief Secretary on Monday to discuss this issue. The services department is still under the L-G of Delhi, which is the governing body of DSSSB. The department has to now come clean on what made them agree to induct such a shoddy question,"" he said.

The board also said they are taking measures to sensitise the paper setters."

A government resolution issued today by the School Education and Sports department stated that each student of Classes I to VIII would be given three packets, of 200 grams each, of skimmed milk powder over three months.

As per the Economic Survey of Maharashtra for 2017-18, the state has 1.18 crore students studying in 1,06,527 primary schools (Std I to Std VIII).

It said that schools will give out these packets in the presence of the management committee on a designated day called ""skimmed milk powder distribution day"".

On this day, schools are also expected to teach parents how to make milk out of the skimmed powder so that they can feed it to their children.

The GR noted that the pilot project was decided upon after observing the surplus production of milk in Maharashtra.

The state government had announced the inclusion of milk or milk powder in the school nutrition scheme in the Legislative Assembly on July 10.

It had also studied the ""ksheera bhagya yojana"" in neighbouring Karnataka.

The ksheera bhagya is a programme of distributing milk to school and anganawadi children by the Karnataka government in collaboration with dairy unions and the state's Department of Primary and Secondary Education and Department of Women and Child Development."

Though Aasim is worried that he already missed two months of school, he confidently says he will continue the legal battle till justice is done. ""I am sure I will get justice. If the school gets upgraded to a high school, it will benefit not only me, but also several students from our region,"" he said.

Aasim, who has 90 per cent disability, completed his Class 7 from the Government Upper Primary School, Velimanna. He will have to travel for 5-10 km to reach the nearest high schools in Koodathayi, Venappara and Karuvanpoyil, which would be quite difficult for the family. Aasim needs his parents' help to commute to the school and meet his basic needs. The boy's plight hit the headlines when he wrote to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan last November, seeking the upgradation of his school, which is hardly 100 meters away so that he can continue his studies without hurdles. Born without hands, Aasim has trained himself to write with his feet. He has disabilities with his legs too.

After many ups and downs, Aasim's chances of continuing his schooling brightened after the High Court directed the Education Department on June 11 to ensure facilities for his higher studies within two weeks.

Aasim's father Muhammed Saeed had filed a petition in the court seeking a direction to the state government to upgrade the upper primary school to a high school and start Class 8 this year itself.

The High Court had dismissed 134 similar petitions for upgradations of schools across the state the same day. But, the government moved the High Court against the order passed by a single-judge bench. In an affidavit, the government said it would arrange a vehicle for Aasim's commute to and fro the nearest school and it was not practical to upgrade the school.

'Counter affidavit filed'

School PTA president Anwar Sadath T K said, ""A counter affidavit was filed in the court on Tuesday, pleading with the court to vacate the stay order. Aasim needs his parents' help to meet his basic needs. Aasim is the eldest among the couple's children and there are four other kids too. It is not practical for the mother to stay back with Aasim during school time. And his father has to be away for work.""

The report also highlighted lack of access to proper means of livelihood, besides sub-standard quality of houses. Almost all tenements were devoid of water supply. Access to monthly ration and healthcare too was irregular for the residents. Concerns about safety of women and girls fell on deaf ears, the report said.

He said that the primary objectives behind the move, as part of the 'Ek Kadam Swachhata Ki Aur' (a step towards cleanliness) initiative, was to inculcate clean habits among students and also to ensure parents of students, many of whom hail from slums, save money on regular haircuts.

""Most of our school students come from the slum areas and they do not receive regular haircuts for various reasons. The minimum cost of a haircut in Ahmedabad is Rs 70 and we believe this programme will allow the parents of these students to save money,"" he said.

Desai, however, maintained that in the city and in municipal schools, no was discriminated on the basis of their castes.

Here are some hilarious books that will get them hooked to the reading habit!

By Arundhati Venkatesh

""Laughter is the reward that lures the most reluctant reader,"" said researcher Michele Landsberg.

Humour and children seem to go hand in hand. Here are five seriously funny chapter books for young readers:

Abhay and Nitya go hunting for monsters in their friends' rooms, but they end up finding all sorts of things instead, even a rat! The characters are full of spunk; Abhay's father with his theories on the moon landing is my favourite, and the wacky illustrations add to the fun. The book is part of the hole series published by Duckbill, a set of early chapter books with large font sizes and delightful illustrations. At around 70 pages, the books are not intimidating. Perfect for those taking their first steps in the world of chapter books.

Another of the Duckbill hOle books, this one has food, secret societies and a gang of friends. Pushkin aka Petu Pumpkin is always eating. When he starts emptying his friends' tiffin boxes, they form a secret society to save their lunches. But the magic potion is a flop and the superglue is a disaster ... Read the book to find out the rest. (Full disclosure: This is one of my books!)

There are more books in the Petu series:

Petu Pumpkin: Tooth Troubles is about shaky teeth, a football match, letters to the tooth fairy and escapades involving dogs.

Petu Pumpkin: Cheater Peter will be in bookstores in August 2018.

Charlie is five, and eats things that shouldn't be eaten, like paper and the sleeves of his shirts. And he is about to start school! An easy-breezy read featuring Charlie, his big brother Max and best friend Henry.

Moin finds a monster under his bed; one that sings silly songs, eats basket loads of bananas, and keeps making up (convenient) monster rules. In a hilarious turn of events, the monster accompanies Moin to school. Kooki's (the Principal, K.K. Kuttykrishnan) encounter with the monster and the ensuing chapter, aptly titled Kooki goes Cuckoo, had me chuckling. Be prepared for some offkey singing by your own little monsters, and don't be surprised if there are requests for banana burgers. There's a funny sequel too -- Moin the Monster Songster.

""No beard and no slippers. All primary teachers will now have to come to school after proper shaving and in formal dress with shoes on.

Currently, there are 6,600 teachers in regular employment of the corporation, the official said. Total number of students enrolled in its schools as on Monday stood at 2,56,000.

According to the Right to Education Act, schools are supposed to have one teacher for every 40 students. This means, for the current number of students, 6,400 teachers are required. That is, 200 less than the total number of regular teachers employed.

'Numbers are faulty'

""The corporation's numbers are faulty,"" said Jitendra Verma, member of Samvida Shikshak Parivar Kalyan Samiti -- a contract teachers union member, who met North Corporation Mayor Adesh Gupta on Wednesday.

""About 450 teachers are getting promoted through the Trained Graduate Teacher [TGT] mode and they have sent a notification for the recruitment of 1,490 teachers through Delhi Subordinate Services Selection Board [DSSSB], then how can they say there is no vacancy,"" asked Kamaljit Singh, a member of the teachers union. ""Many of us have been working at these posts for the past 13-14 years. Where are we supposed to go now,"" he asked.

Expect a rise in students

By the end of August, when enrolment is typically at its highest, the corporation expects the total number of students to rise by 2,78,000.

This would take the number of required teachers to 6,950. Which means, contracts of at least about half of the teachers, finding themselves unemployed will likely be renewed.

The demand for teachers has also seen a drop because fewer students are being enrolled in corporation schools.

For instance, as of August last year, the total number of students enrolled were 2,98,000. That is, 20,000 more than the total number of students expected to enrol this year.

The North Corporation Mayor said, ""The facts being brought forward by the officials and the union are at odds and need to be examined. A decision will be taken based on the interests of everyone involved."""

The government primary school at Kattarampur in the heart of Karimnagar town has only one teacher and 10 students.

Though the registers show that the school has a strength of 23 students, but only less than 10 turn up everyday. During a visit on Saturday, there were only nine students, including one student each for first class and fifth class. The lone teacher, who is also headmistress of the school, conducts classes for all the students in a single room.

Incidentally, the district authorities have posted an office subordinate male (attender) to this primary school to open and close the single classroom. The authorities were planning to fill up two vacant SGT posts in the school during this present ongoing transfer and counselling programme.

The locals suggested that the government close down the primary school and shift the students into nearby Government High School in Savaran Street in the same locality. They pointed out that the government had already closed more than 127 primary schools in the erstwhile Karimnagar district which had enrolment of below 20 students as per the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE) survey.

Running of a school without students by paying salaries to the teaching and non-teaching staff was a waste of taxpayer's money, Lok Satta Udyama Samstha district president N. Srinivas said. ""When there is no enrolment, it is better to merge the school with another school and utilize the existing resources for other public service,"" he added.

School headmistress Ramadevi said that the parents were not sending their children to the school as a road was passing through the school premises posing a threat to the students. Due to busy road, the students were confined to the classroom and there is no play and other recreational activities, she said and added that the admissions would increase into the school if there was a compound wall around the school.

Telangana Rashtra Teachers Federation (TRTF) district president M. Prathap Reddy was of the opinion that the government teachers were not meeting the expectations of the parents of the students on par with their private counterparts.

Teachers should instil confidence among the parents to ensure that they enroll in the government schools, he said."

At a time when most government school authorities complain of lack of resources, the principal of the primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki has formed students' music bands in his institute.

Both the boys' and the girls' bands, introduced a few months ago, have 12 members each. They play on special occasions, such as, the Republic Day, the Independence Day and others. Members sport vibrant uniforms, as they play snare drum, bass drum, trumpet and flute, setting a benchmark for other primary schools.

""I carefully picked their outfit, which includes a green T-shirt, a white half pant/skirt, white shoes, a tri-coloured cap and a scarf, to exude an aura of patriotism,"" said principal Sushil Kumar.

From introducing smart classes to the music bands, Kumar is leaving no stone unturned in transforming the school's image into that of a model school. ""I saw how in private schools, enthusiastic children took out Republic Day processions on the symphony of ensembles. I wanted that for our kids here as well,"" he said.

Eleven-year-old Man Singh, who is on the bass drum, said, ""It is a wonderful experience. We get to dress differently and perform in public."" Another student, Sachin Kumar, 10, who is on the snare drum, added, ""I feel happy when we perform and the spectators appreciate us."" Their training was facilitated by district scout master Rajendra Tripathi.

Eager to bring about a change, Kumar said he bought the musical instruments using the money received as part of the 'Excellent School Award' won by the institute during the Akhilesh Yadav regime.

School teacher Jyoti Rawat, 33, said, ""On hearing about an upcoming event, children get ecstatic. Performing in front of their parents and relatives make them feel they are doing something extraordinary.""

Showering praise on the Kumar's initiative, Skand Shukla, deputy secretary, director basic shiksha parishad, Allahabad, said, ""This initiative of forming music band in a government run primary school is a shining example for other school principals to replicate. It will make education more fun.""

The school is technologically equipped with a projector, laptops and computers. Little wonder then that the student attendance is as high as 80% and the number of enrolments have gone up from 119 to 160. In April, this year, the school also got recognised as an English medium school, which is helping attract students even from private schools, said school authorities.

""The government and various NGOs helped this school in many ways, such as, providing furniture, laptops, computers and drinking water facilities among others,"" said Kumar, who was felicitated with the national Information and Communication Technology award in 2017.

He also used crowd funding on Facebook to get money to upgrade the infrastructure. Acknowledging the community's support, Kumar said, ""Computers were given to us by the Baba Amarnath Sewa Mandal, sports equipment came from community members, furniture came from Govind Industry, and mid day meals are provided by the government.""

""Out of five classes, two are furnished with tables and chairs. For the others, we will arrange furniture soon. Our premises are also very clean, as much emphasis is placed on personal and environmental hygiene. I am working on providing maximum learning to students through minimum investment.

The survey reveals that the number of children attending Class 1 to 8 had fallen from 16.17 million in the academic year 2014-15 to 15.91 million in 2017-18 - a drop of 1.6%. The enrolment at secondary and higher secondary level (Class 9 to 12) went up by 7.6%, from 6.18 million to 6.64 million over the same period.

Experts have not been able to identify the exact reasons behind the drop in the number of children in primary school; they have implied that the fall in the number of children in primary schools could be because of rising dropout rates and a dip in fertility rates. Though India is ensuring that a larger proportion of children remain in school, dropout rates are still a concern. A study titled 'School Dropouts: Examining the space of reasons' authored by Arun NR Kishore and KS Shaji, published in the Indian Journal of Psychological Medicine, says that in 1993, 27 million children were enrolled in Class I in schools across the country. In 2003, only 10 m of these children (one in three) reached Class 10.

Two separate sets of data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) can explain the fall in the number of children in primary schools. The NFHS 4 for 2015-16, released last year, says that the number of children below 15 years, as a percentage of the total population of Maharashtra, fell to 24.5% in 2015-16 compared to 30.6% in 2005-2006 when NFHS 3 was compiled. Similarly, the fertility rate - the number of children born to a woman - has declined from 2.1 to 1.9 between the periods of the two surveys.

During this period, the state's population has grown, though moderately, and NHFS data does not indicate whether this fall in proportion of under-15 in the state's population has also resulted in a decline in absolute numbers. But data from the national population census reveal that the absolute number of children are also declining. The state's child population (in this case, children up to six years) was 13.32 million in 2011 - a decline of around 345,000 from the earlier population count in 2001. As a percentage of the total population, the proportion of children up to six years has dropped from 17.1% in 1991 to 14.1% in 2001, falling further to 11.9% in 2011. The proportion could be below 10% now if the trend has continued.

All these data suggest that women in Maharashtra are having fewer children, resulting in the drop in the number of students in primary schools. Data on school enrolment also suggest that the decline in number of students in primary schools could be because of a drop in the absolute numbers for that age group. A study of over 100,000 households, conducted last year by the Maharashtra government, found that 99.3 per cent children in age group 6-14 years were attending school.

The changes in Maharashtra's child demographics follow trends in other parts of the country. The NFHS shows that in Kerala, the proportion of children below 15 years fell from 24.4% of the population in 2005-06 to 20.2% in 2015-16. Even in Bihar, where fertility rates are still high - though it fell from 4 in 2005-2006 to 3.4 in 2015-16, the proportion of under-15 fell from 43.8% to 39.3 during the same period.

Education experts have said that when there is a drop in the number of students in schools because of demographic changes, there is an opportunity to improve facilities in schools as the per-capita spend (money spent on each child) on education goes up, with opportunities to pursue a lower student-teacher ratio and better infrastructure.

Of course, teaching and learning standards, especially in schools run by the state government and municipal corporations, continue to be abysmal. The Annual Status of Education (ASER) survey showed that only 27% of students in Class 8 can read Class 2-level texts and 31% of Class 8 students can do the simple mathematical exercise of dividing numbers."
