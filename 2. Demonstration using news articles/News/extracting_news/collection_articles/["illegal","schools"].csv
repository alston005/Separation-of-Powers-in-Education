The UP cabinet cleared the policy on Tuesday. In the past week, there have been at least three incidents of farmers locking up stray cattle in schools and police stations in the state to protest against the stray cattle menace.

The state is staring at a severe stray cattle problem, aggravated after the government cracked down on illegal slaughter houses. After several cases surfaced of people suspected to be smuggling, transporting or consuming cow meat being lynched, ageing cattle are simply being abandoned across the state. In rural UP, farmers have reported massive losses after cattle strayed into farm land and destroyed crops while cattle along roads have led to several accidents.

The new cess may raise alcohol prices in UP. The excise department will soon decide which items will be included in the cess. A senior official said the cess will start being levied from this week itself.

Excise minister Jai Pratap Singh said he was against including alcohol under the new cess. ""I'm not in favour of having this cess on alcohol as it will lead to illegal sales. A meeting will be held very soon to discuss which items could be covered under the cess,"" Singh told TOI.

A cess of 0.5% will be levied on toll tax collected by government agencies such as the UP Expressway and Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), and on profits made by public sector enterprises and construction agencies such as UP State Construction and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited, UP State Bridge Corporation Ltd, UPSIDC etc. Mandi parishads, which contribute 1% of their income for gau saurakshan (cow protection), will increase this amount to 2%.

Under the new policy, temporary cow shelters will be constructed in each rural and urban local body, down to the nagar nigams. Each district is to have capacity for a minimum of 1,000 cattle.

The state animal husbandry department will supervise and their construction will be funded through MNREGA and MLA and MP funds.

Those caught abandoning cattle after these shelters are up and running can expect to be penalised with fines. Local police and administration are to ensure cattle for which there is no use are taken to the shelters and those who abandon cattle are fined."

India as a country, in terms of expanse and population, is huge. With a population of over 1.2 billion, 39% are children, which is around 470 million. Children are not just our future, but our present too, and we need to work collectively to ensure that their rights are protected.

Was 2018 a game-changer for India's children? While some decisions taken by the Centre have been a step towards the right direction, events in which child rights have been violated have slowed down the growth process. Certain cases like Kathua, Unnao and the Bihar shelter homes incident depict the grim severity of the situation, and the urgency for us to step up as citizens to take a definitive action against these incidents.

Shelter Homes and The Trafficking of Persons Bill

One of the monumental decisions taken by the Parliament was the passing of The Trafficking of Persons (Prevention, Protection and Rehabilitation) Bill 2018 by the Lok Sabha in the July session. It proposes a punishment ranging from 10 years of rigorous imprisonment to life term and a fine of not less than Rs 1 lakh for people caught in carrying out trafficking activities. It aims to create institutional mechanisms at the district, state and central level to curb trafficking.Hundreds of children go missing in India every year and are sold for labour or sexual exploitation. The bill has provisions to provide rehabilitation, skill development and education to the victims.

As the Parliament winter session is ongoing, over 12,000 trafficking survivors from 14 states have written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the passage of the Trafficking bill in the Rajya Sabha. Women and Child development minister Maneka Gandhi also expressed hope for the passage of the crucial trafficking bill.

The Deoria shelter home incident was another case that gained limelight. A shelter home in Deoria, Uttar Pradesh, run by Girija Tripathi was found to be engaging in illegal activities. The girls in the shelter home were subjected to physical, sexual and mental abuse. Tripathi used her clout with influential local politicians and bureaucrats to run the home and get away with these barbaric acts. 24 girls aged 5-15 were rescued from being trafficked, but 18 are still missing.

The Kathua Rape Case Shook the Nation

The year started on a shocking note. In January 2018, 8-year-old Asifa Bano was abducted, drugged with sedatives, brutally raped and murdered in Kathua, Jammu & Kashmir. A week after she went missing, her body was found by villagers of the neighbouring village.

The Kathua rape case was just one of the many. After the incident, the Parliament took a stand and passed the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill 2018. The amendment calls for death punishment for rapists who have raped girls below the age of 12. If the girl is under 16, the minimum punishment will be 20 years to life imprisonment; a change from the previous 10 year sentence. In case of gangrape of a girl below 12 years of age, the accused will be sentenced to life imprisonment or death. The bill also mandates that the investigation and trial must be completed within two months and dismissed.

Children and Health

United Nations Child Mortality Report released this year stated that there were 1.14 million children deaths in India every year. This means 3 infants die every minute. Most of the children die before they turn 5 due to curable and preventable diseases like pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria and birth complications.The number of deaths was the lowest India has had in 5 years but is still the highest in the world.

This September, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. This scheme is supposedly the world's largest health care scheme. It will provide 10 crore poor households a reimbursement of upto Rs.5 lakh for secondary and tertiary hospitalisation charges of the entire family. This year 17 crore children were given polio drops catering to a healthy childhood.

Children in Schools

Twelve million children are yet to be enrolled in schools.The dropout rate is fairly high either due to affordability or some other social issue. Girls are married off at a young age and forced to quit schools. 1 in every 3 child brides in the world is a girl in India. The National Social Assistance programme has allocated Rs. 9975 crore by the government this year. The budget plans to treat education holistically.

The emphasis is on improving education by giving proper training to teachers. A merger of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan is in the pipeline. This joint scheme envisions to ensure inclusive and equitable education from nursery to the senior secondary stage.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has said that the country is looking to spend Rs 1 trillion to revitalize the infrastructure of higher educational institutions.

The Gender Divide

According to the Lancet Global Health Journal released in May 2018, around 2,39,000 girls under the age of 5 die each year in India due to gender discrimination.

Once the girl is born, negligence in her upbringing leads to illnesses. 32% of the girls enrolled in schools drop out. This is because of family constraints, insufficient funds and lack of sanitation facilities during their menstruation cycle. Therefore, the percentage of literate women and girls is less in comparison to men.

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme started by the Government in 2015 aims to improve the efficiency of implementation of welfare schemes for women. Through the government campaigns people have started realizing that gender doesn't define capability. This programme has increased the intake of girls in schools but it still has a long way to go.

2018 has seen a number of child rights violation cases, but also seen steps to resolve them and prevent such events in future. We, as responsible citizens, need to question and observe the life children are leading and do our bit to save their childhood. A small step towards the right direction can go a long way in making India safe for children."

States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

RSS prant sanghchalak of Jammu and Kashmir, Brig (retd) Suchait Singh confirmed the Hindu organisation's strategy to this correspondent. ""While the RSS does not have any political motives, it is only asking the people to avoid NOTA during the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in the state,"" said Singh. With the state assembly dissolved and Jammu and Kashmir under President's rule, assembly elections could be held along with the general elections.

RSS has jumped in to save BJP's sinking ship in Jammu and Ladakh, where the party has come under a lot of criticism from the locals.

Unfulfilled promises

BJP's popularity in Hindu-dominated Jammu and Buddhist Ladakh dipped substantially after it failed to make good on its 2014 Lok Sabha poll promises in both regions. Ladakh BJP MP Thupstan Chhewang recently resigned over the unfulfilled promise of making Ladakh a Union Territory (UT), and of including Bhoti language in the eighth schedule.

Before the 2014 general elections, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, too, had promised that the arid desert region would be made a UT once the BJP came to power. It had won all of its 25 state assembly seats from Jammu region, coming to power in alliance with the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

Suchait Singh said Buddhists in Ladakh have a favourable opinion of RSS and take part in shakhas as well. ""Also, two RSS-run schools are in Ladakh educating many,"" he said, adding that Chhewang, unfortunately, was upset with the BJP, but efforts were on to bring him back.

In Jammu, the BJP had assured to end the perceived hegemony of Muslim-dominated Kashmir, scrapping of Article 370, and deportation of Rohingyas settled in Jammu and seen as a security threat by locals. With all these promises remaining just on papers, Hindus in Jammu have now lost faith in the party.

In the recently-held urban local body (ULB) poll, the BJP was wiped out from Ladakh region, where it failed to win even a single seat in the municipal committee of Leh and Kargil, the only two districts of Ladakh.

Its declining graph in Jammu is evident from the fact that the party was not able to perform well in ULB polls in many areas where it had won during the 2014 assembly elections -- in the Kishtwar Municipal Committee, it was left red-faced winning only one out of the total 13 seats; in the municipal committees of Doda, Bhaderwah and Samba, the party won three seats each of the total 17, 13 and 13, respectively, and in the Ramban Municipal Committee, it bagged two of the seven; in Reasi Municipal Committee, it won six of the 13 seats, while in Kathua Municipal Council, it got eight out of the 21, as confirmed in this official notification.

Dousing the fire

The 25 December visit of RSS National General Secretary Suresh Joshi, popularly known as Bhaiyyaji Joshi, to Jammu, where he met delegations from the two regions, is being seen as damage control to placate Jammu and Ladakh locals ahead of the polls. BJP's Jammu and Kashmir top leaders also met Joshi to devise an election strategy.

It's learnt that the RSS leader was upset with the BJP state unit for not being able to handle the situation, leading to its debacle in the ULB polls and Chhewang's resignation.

The RSS also doesn't want to let one of its core issues -- of Ram Mandir -- to slip out of its hands, and has been propagating it in Jammu ahead of the polls.

During his three-day visit, Joshi spoke about the temple and asked the Hindus not to lose hope of its construction. ""If Hindus remain united, there is no power in the world that can divide or destroy them. Ram Mandir must be built at Ayodhya, as the matter is linked to the faith of more than 80 crore Hindus,"" he said during a religious event in Samba district.

During his visit, it was also decided to woo the Gujjars and Bakarwals who have, since decades, helped security forces by providing information regarding movement of terrorists (the nomadic community moves to mountains in Kashmir and back to plains in Jammu during its seasonal migration through treacherous landscapes).

'BJP has lost its vote base in Jammu'

Political commentator Professor Hari Om said BJP's vote bank has depleted severely over time. ""People of Jammu had voted the saffron party to power over the promise of scrapping of Article 370, Article 35-A, deportation of Rohingyas, providing Hindus with minority rights in Jammu and Kashmir (as the state has a Muslim majority) and re-organisation of the state with Ladakh as a UT. If Prime Minister Narendra Modi fulfils these promises even now, the party can get a boost at the national level,"" said the professor.

He added that the winning margins of BJP candidates in the ULB polls were not even a patch on their assembly election ones, ""indicating that the party has lost a lot of its vote base in Jammu"".

BJP had publicised its win in 100 wards in Kashmir valley in the ULB polls to give the impression that it was able to win over the locals. The fact, however, is that the saffron party's candidates had won unopposed reportedly due to a boycott call given by the main players PDP and National Conference (NC).

RSS had already sensed trouble for the BJP, as sah-sarkaryavah Manmohan Vaidya had visited Jammu in March and taken up issues related to the region with BJP ministers. The issues included the infamous Kathua rape, discrimination against Jammu by Kashmir-centric political parties and illegal Rohingya settlers.

Opposition mounts attack

Meanwhile, sensing BJP's weakening position in Jammu, opponents have started taking potshots at the party. NC Provincial President Devender Singh Rana termed the BJP ""a major source of Jammu's woes"", saying its leaders superimposed their personal welfare over people's aspirations.

""BJP has lost credibility as well as moral authority to seek votes again by pretending to be Jammu's messiah, as it failed to fulfill its promises in its three-and-a-half years' nightmarish rule. During this period, development suffered and Jammu pride sustained severe bruises, with BJP leaders remaining glued to power.""

The BJP had ended its alliance with the PDP in June, after which the state came under the Governor's rule. Late on November 21, the state assembly was dissolved, paving the way for assembly polls.

Nature is everything for them. The tribals, who migrated to this place from the erstwhile south Bihar and now Jharkhand decades ago, care and worship the forests, hills and ever-flowing narrow streams descending from the hills.

These tribals love, protect and preserve the forest as they believe they can only survive in the lap of woods. However, they do not lead a normal life as they have been deprived of basic infrastructure like road, electricity, water, educational institutes, primary health centres and transportation facilities. In the 21st century, they still live like jungle men and women -- ignorant of another world that claims itself to be civilised and modern.

What has held back the development activities is inaccessibility. One has to trek miles to reach these villages. All efforts to build roads and electricity infrastructure have fallen flat due to lack of coordination between forest and revenue departments. The forest department, as for Forest Conservation Act, 1980, considers residents of these villages illegal occupants. This has stood in the way of the villages getting the ""revenue village"" tag.

Non-recognition of the human habitations as revenue villages prevents the education department to build schools and the health department to establish hospitals. There are about 10,000 people living in 61 villages of Simlipal forests.

""We have no primary and high schools here. The only Anganwadi centre has no government teacher. It is managed by Centre for Youth and Social Development, a development organisation. Since we have no hospital here, people are left to fend for themselves. Last year, we lost two children and a pregnant woman died this year as we could not take them to the hospital which is 12 km from here. We carry the patients on slings and cots and walk down to hospitals,"" said Sadhu Makhud of Jharjhari village under Thakurmunda block.

Early-age marriage is seen to be continuing in these villages. This has resulted in both mother and children suffering from malnourishment and other health complications.

Birasingha Ugrasandhi, a resident of Bhaliadal village, said despite repeated requests to the Mayurbhanj district administration, there are no activities related to infrastructure development.

""Besides roads, schools and hospitals, we also fight to get drinking water. Our village does not have tubewells or dug wells. The narrow streams flowing down from the nearby hills shrink in the summer and get contaminated because of overdependence on them by human beings, domestic animals and wildlife. Villagers often get sick after drinking contaminated water,"" says Birasingha.

Lack of education has forced the people to continue with their primitive living style - herding goats and collecting firewood to cook their food, besides undertaking poultry activities.

Agriculture has been confined to growing paddy and vegetables, which is at the mercy of rain god.

""Since we have no government mandi or procurement centre here, we are forced to sell our paddy between '1,100 and '1,200 per quintal as against '1,750 minimum support price (MSP) fixed by the Union government,"" says Jagabandhu Ho of Bhaliadal.

The villagers are yet to see a television set. For them, radio is the only source of information and entertainment.

Today, the villagers are living a little better life as Oxfam, an international development organisation, in association with Regional Center for Development Cooperation, a Bhubaneswar-based non-governmental organisation, is intervening in those villages. Erection of solar-lighting and solar-irrigation systems has brought about significant changes in their lives.

People are now able to charge their mobile phones with solar battery. They can now irrigate their land with solar water pumps.

With the help of development organisations, the area is coordinating with the district administration. As a result, some villagers have got Individual Forest Rights (IFR) and Community Forest Rights (CFR). This has enabled them to undertake cultivation. Grant of CFR has helped them procure forest produces without hassles, process them and sell them to various government and agencies, including state government's Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS). Such activities are slowly improving the local economy.

Dillip Subudhi, a leading researcher who spent over 17 years in villages situated in Similipal and forests in other parts of the state, feels there will be remarkable improvement in the life of forest dwellers once their habitations are recognised as revenue villages and they are given IFR and CFR over their claimed lands as per the Forest Rights Act, 2006.

""Though the Odisha government has a good track record in settling IFR and CFR claims, a lot of activities remain to be done. In villages, people have got IFR and CFR titles over their claimed lands. However, many of them still cannot make productive use of these lands as the lands granted to them are yet to be demarcated by revenue officials,"" says Mr Subudhi.

Speaking to this newspaper, state ST & SC development minister Ramesh Chandra Majhi said the government had asked the district administrations to complete the titles of the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019.

""We have asked the collectors of all tribal-dominated districts to settle the IFR and CFR claims by March 2019. Once this process is complete, you will see significant change in the life of forest dwellers,"" the minister said.

Of the 4.19 crore population of Odisha, nearly 23 per cent (22.85 per cent, according to 2011 census) is tribal.

In almost all the tribal-dominated districts, the conditions of those living in forests are almost identical, say social activists who have been working among the marginalised sections of society."

Then a group of women decided to take a chance.

In 2017, an unlikely group of entrepreneurs -- refugee women armed with an idea, some cooking skills and a lot of hope -- built and opened Timangolo's first and only restaurant. Within two months, the women were turning a profit. How they found the confidence, basic business skills and capital needed to bring their dream to reality highlights the success of an International Medical Corps program known as Women and Girls Safe Spaces (WGSS), and how it can empower even society's most vulnerable people.

The idea of women's safe spaces in unstable environments is not new and has grown widely over the past decade, especially in areas where strongly patriarchal cultures exist and the disruption of armed conflict or natural disaster can make women and girls even more vulnerable. Even so, opportunities can be found here: though women and girls are disproportionally exposed to traditional cultural barriers and safety risks, they are often the agents of positive change in their communities. Spaces created by programs such as WGSS function as safe havens that in crisis fulfill a critical need -- where survivors of gender-based violence (GBV) can discreetly muster the confidence to report such incidents without fear of reprisal and receive immediate support.

In more routine times, the safe spaces are locations where women and girls can gather in a protective environment, receive information, build support networks to improve their safety and well-being, and gain skills that can empower them.

In the case of the Timangolo restaurant, a safe space provided a place where the aspiring women investors first received encouragement to proceed with their project, then got the tools needed to launch it: advice from an International Medical Corps partner with expertise on running a business, plus a start-up grant of less than $100.

International Medical Corps is an acknowledged leader globally in the development of WGSS programs and has helped establish them in some 20 countries affected by humanitarian emergencies, including Cameroon. The programs have become an important part of our work to prevent GBV and to support survivors of such violence when it does occur.

In Cameroon, groups of vulnerable women and girls include refugees from Nigeria's far north and western areas, as well as from CAR's East Region and local host communities. In neighboring Nigeria, groups include residents of camps for internally displaced persons (IDPs) in and around the cities of Maiduguri and Damboa in the troubled northeastern areas, where the infamous Boko Haram militant group first began its attacks more than a decade ago and continues to be a malign presence, strengthened by an alliance with the Islamic State.

International Medical Corps' technical coordinator for GBV programs in Cameroon, Jacqueline Uwimana, explains that there are three key components to our strategy for preventing violence against vulnerable women and girls:

Raising awareness within communities on women's civil and human rights, and underscoring that culturally accepted traditions of inflicting violence upon women and girls are illegal, morally wrong and must be reported to authorities;

Adding capacity to raise awareness and provide essential assistance to survivors of GBV, including individual case management and the option for referral to complementary services; and

Empowering women to raise their voices, by creating women-led organizations within communities, and strengthening support networks for women and girls to provide them with skills that can generate income, such as embroidery, sewing, catering, trading, textiles and farming.

""The culture prevents women from speaking up at meetings or discussing issues in public like rape and other violence toward women,"" says Hassana Pindar, who manages International Medical Corps' WGSS program in Nigeria. ""We urge them to speak out because it's their right to do so.""

Yet Pindar admits it has not been an easy task. ""When we started, the cultural barriers were too high,"" she recalls. ""Women had to ask their husband's permission just to leave the house and come to the women's shelter. Once here, they would nervously check the time to make sure they wouldn't be late home. Very, very, very slowly they gained confidence, so that now it's no longer an issue.""

The key to this change of behavior? A simple three-letter word: men. Long treated mainly as the central cause of GBV, men were instinctively viewed as the barrier to progress -- the adversary of women seeking empowerment to do more with their lives. Though men certainly play this role, they are not destined to forever do so. They also have the power to transform community resistance toward women's empowerment into wholehearted support, because in highly conservative, traditional societies, community leaders and elders -- invariably men -- are the custodians of these traditions.

""How could we change this without being helped by the keepers of traditions?"" Uwimana asks rhetorically. ""Impossible.""

Pindar agrees. ""To gain acceptance of these new ideas in the community, we have to engage the men,"" she says.

Faced with this reality, program managers like Pindar and Uwimana began reaching out to community leaders and others in positions of influence to convince them that oppression and violence against women and girls weaken the community as a whole. They also began to push back against community efforts to stifle the reporting of GBV-related incidents while promoting efforts to empower women by teaching them income-generating skills.

Uwimana says her team actively searched for potential partners among men in the in the community: those who sent their children to school, for example, or were known to help their wives, and who could understand the benefits of preventing GBV and of empowering their spouse by providing them with the option to learn skills that could add both to household income and to the community's economy. They offered these men sensitivity training -- within what Uwimana calls ""Husband's Schools"" -- where they could learn how to communicate women's empowerment as a social benefit for both individual families and the community.

""We've learned we have to engage men in this, especially for violence prevention,"" she says. ""Once they get it, that's when we begin to see progress.""

Progress has come in many forms -- such as the organized pushback against plans by a local Muslim imam in the Cameroon town of Mblie to marry an 11-year-old girl. After eventually giving in to the pressure from other men involved in Husband's School, he renounced the planned marriage and joined a village committee campaigning against gender-based violence. Today, when child marriages do occur, they usually are conducted in the community's shadows.

In the Nigerian town of Auno, a 48-year-old husband and father named Mallam Dauda says that an International Medical Corps sensitivity session for men about the social and economic consequences of GBV changed his life. ""I now often talk with other men about its dangers,"" he explains proudly.

The lesson here is that when residents of both sexes work together to protect women and girls, and encourage active community engagement, the outcomes can be impressive.

""We've seen some wonderful results,"" notes Pindar. ""I've seen women who were hardly surviving who are now able to provide for their families and plan for their futures. The programs have changed, the design has changed. That's why we've achieved success.""

Though Women and Girls' Safe Spaces have existed for many years, there were few guidelines available for which strategies worked and which didn't. To rectify this, in 2014 International Medical Corps began a two-year research project -- with support from the US State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration (BPRM) -- to study the effectiveness of the safe spaces created for refugees who had fled war in South Sudan for camps in Gambella, Ethiopia. Findings from this study reinforced our commitment to the safe spaces as an important approach for supporting women and girls.

In 2017, International Medical Corps partnered with the International Rescue Committee to develop guidance that could be used globally to implement safe spaces for women and girls: The Women's Safe Space Toolkit (WSSTK), which is being developed through coordination with multiple agencies and piloted in four countries, with BPRM support. Work on the project began in early 2018 and is expected to take two years to complete.

Meanwhile, back in the village of Timangolo, the initial success of the refugee women restauranteurs led them to reinvest their initial profits in upgrading restaurant's building. The upgrades generated profits of 300,000 Cameroon francs (about $520) over a period of five months -- and started the women thinking about other possible ventures to empower themselves and the community."

New Delhi: Shais Khan, a 23-year-old masseur from Delhi, has a dream. He wants to be the next Sunny Leone, an unabashed porn star not confined to the seedy underbelly that is the world of Indian adult cinema today.

""I'm crazy about my dream,"" Shais, now a regular in Indian porn productions, told ThePrint. ""I don't have words to explain how crazy I am.""

Shais' introduction to porn came five years ago, when he took up a job at a spa owned by French nationals. ""I have been working here for five years, so my owners used to show me French (porn) videos..."" he said.

The idea of performing porn instantly intrigued Shais, who began filming adult videos with the help of friends.

""There's a profession for everything. There are schools for teachers and parlours for beauticians, but there isn't a porn industry in India, so those who want to pursue this profession have to find a way around it,"" Shais said.

While he has become a recognisable face in the Indian gay porn industry, Shais is waiting for porn to be legalised in the country, when he would be able to show off his ""diverse skill set"".

Studies show the Indian market is big enough to make porn a viable career option for the likes of Shais.

The sixth annual review conducted by Pornhub, released recently, showed that Indians love to watch porn, with the country accounting for the third highest daily traffic to the adult video site in 2018, behind only the US and the UK.

The same report suggested that nothing gets Indians quite as excited as seeing other Indians having sex: For the second year in a row, top searches for Indians contained the words 'Indian' or 'Hindi'.

Pari Tomar, a YouTube star, made big bucks off soft-porn videos (a less sexually explicit variant) until March 2016, when significant changes to the portal's monetisation and content policies rendered cleavage shots and heavy panting unprofitable.

""I used to work about 20-25 days a month, sometimes acting in up to eight short films a day,"" she told ThePrint. While it was allowed, Pari charged Rs 15,000 for a day of work. ""But now those films don't get produced anymore, [as] they tell me they were getting too vulgar for the internet. So I do mostly comedy.""

Richa Kaul Padte, author of Cyber Sexy: Rethinking Pornography, said Indians were looking for sexual content featuring Indians online. ""And because we don't have a porn industry in India, this demand is being fulfilled either by brown actors in American/Western porn, and by homemade porn -- which is made, either consensually or non-consensually -- by regular people in India,"" she added.

However, Indian policy, experts say, has often been out of step with this reality.

Despite the fact that the demand for well-produced Indian porn is growing every year, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) banned over 800 websites offering adult content in October, the censor board sanitises sexuality in Bollywood movies, and Section 67 of the IT Act criminalises ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" with imprisonment of up to five years and a fine of up to Rs 10 lakh.

The reasons span from moral objections, to the belief that porn is a major driver of sexual crime, as evidenced in the Uttarakhand High Court order that led to the TRAI directive.

But experts and industry insiders say such bans deprive the country of a vast revenue source, while potentially turning a willing audience to portals offering illegal content.

""All the money is basically going into the pockets of international companies,"" said Yash Juneja, a Jharkhand-based music store owner who also makes semi-porn films for private clients.

""They come shoot here, or Indians upload porn on their sites, and they earn all the advertisement and subscriber-based revenue,"" he added.

The true potential of porn in India remains unexplored: Some estimates peg the global porn industry's worth at $97 billion. The US, where porn is legal and users accounted for the highest daily traffic to Pornhub in 2018, is said to alone have a porn industry worth $10-12 billion.

Goutham Shivshankar, an advocate-on-record in the Supreme Court, told ThePrint that the ""the primary target in Indian law is 'obscenity' and not 'pornography', except child pornography, which is specifically and separately dealt with under section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000"".

While Section 67 of the Act rules ""publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form"" a punishable offence, viewing or storing pornography in India is not illegal.

This means that you can make a sex tape and store it on your phone, and you are clear legally as long as you don't upload it on a website or distribute it via email, WhatsApp or any other digital platform.

""If India legalises porn, we would stand out as the largest consumers of porn in the world,"" Vaibhav, an IT-consultant-turned-director who has worked on porn films, told ThePrint.

Legalising porn, he said, will ensure that India matches international standards, with the ensuing influx of capital and investment likely to bring Indian porn and its local purveyors out of the shadows and help them carve their own niche.

""The actors there (in the West) are doing it out of their own will. There is no desperation for money attached to it,"" he said.

""Jisko bhook lagi hui hai na, voh dhoondhta rahega jab tak uski bhook nahi mitti hai (A person hungering for something will continue to look for it till his desire is not satiated),"" said Vaibhav.

He said legalisation will also help throttle exploitative sex. ""Porn should be legalised... at least in the name of craft and art, because someone will not get molested,"" he added.

One of the most substantial arguments in favour of legalisation rests on consent. At least in perception, the porn industry has been globally linked with human trafficking, rape and assault, and the dehumanisation of women as sex objects.

But Padte argues that decriminalisation will prevent such exploitation.

""There are so many reasons why decriminalisation is a good idea,"" she told ThePrint, ""From distinguishing between consensual and non-consensual content to creating safe spaces for sexuality to developing a range of sexual expressions -- but I guess I would boil it down to the fact that criminalising sexual expression is a really bad idea.""

""It doesn't 'protect' anyone,"" she added. ""All it does is push the whole thing underground, which means that where violence does take place, we don't have mechanisms in place to address it.""

As it stands today, the porn industry in India largely works under the disguise of various ""legitimate"" professions - Several photographers, modelling agencies, massage parlours and smaller production houses supplement their day jobs with the recession-proof padding that porn provides.

Aungshita Chatterjee, 43, has dreams of becoming an international boudoir photographer, and while her aim may be a legal one, she tells ThePrint that ""at some point, a lot of the other photographers discovered that their DSLRs come with an in-built video option"".

""So yes, porn is being made -- in bedrooms and guest houses and studios, and it's uploaded on international servers or sold to clients from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Russia, and the United Kingdom through brokers,"" she said.

According to Aungshita, who says she was also once offered $75,000 by an American producer named Cedric to shoot a porn film with Indian models, the porn industry is pan-India, with behind-the-scenes producers operating from Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, and ""especially the south"".

But TRAI bans websites with pornographic content that are hosted on Indian domains -- so where does one upload these films?

According to Sameer, a Chennai-based filmographer who acts as the logistical matchmaker between a porn producer and a model in south India, Indians have found a way to circumvent even that obstacle. ""Everything is uploaded on Twitter, Tumblr and xvideos,"" he told ThePrint. When asked what happens in these movies, he said, ""Direct sex.""

South India is where the money is, added Juneja, because actors are easier to source, more willing to take risk on screen, and ""less likely to throw tantrums or be afraid of backlash from society"".

Sameer said at least a hundred such movies are produced monthly in the south, with actors getting paid up to Rs 50,000 per movie. The films are usually 50 minutes long and the whole production costs between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh.

However, much of Indian porn is defined by hand-held cameras, mobile phones balanced against a wall, mirrors, and low resolution, which doesn't seem to be satisfying viewers increasingly seeking out high-definition content.

According to the Pornhub report, 'HD' or 'high-definition' emerged as a popular keyword in searches keyed in by Indians.

In response to a report on ThePrint about the Pornhub review, a Reddit user claimed he had been ""looking for Desi HD for about ten years. It's just not there"".

""The best you get is a guy/gal with a good mobile phone,"" he wrote.

Everything apart, experts and insiders say the consequences of an underground industry can be severe. Informal productions don't entitle actors to health check-ups, salary standards, or protection from exploitation.

Even someone like Shais, who says that his years in the sex industry had forced him to develop a thick skin, knows everyone cannot be trusted.

He recalls paying a friend Rs 30,000 for a film he was told would be shot with good equipment.

But a few days after the payment, the friend disappeared. His phone was switched off and the money was gone.

The students of St Mary's School - ICSE, and their parents have to navigate through a narrow road, a missing zebra crossing, and taxis parked anywhere to get to it everyday. The parents claim taxi drivers often refuse to ferry them, allegedly because they want long-distance fares.

Nesbit Road where the school is situated, connects Dr B R Ambedkar Road to several areas in Mazgaon. It passes over the Central Railway tracks through a road overbridge, and this is where the challenge starts for the school going kids and their parents.

A woman traffic constable and a traffic warden are posted outside the school, but parents say there should be more such personnel there

With two schools and a college along this all important road, reaching the school through the traffic is a daunting task for kids and parents. There are three important educational institutions along Nesbit Road including St. Mary's School - ICSE, Burhani College of Commerce and Arts, and Diamond Jubilee High School near Byculla Railway Colony.

As the school starts in the morning and ends at around 3 pm, the biggest problem then the students and parents have to face, is crossing the narrow but busy road. Some private vehicles which come to pick up the kids are also parked anywhere.

While a lady traffic police constable and a traffic warden manage traffic when the school ends, the parents complained that there is a need for more personnel as there are two schools along the road. While the footpaths were in proper shape and condition, the zebra crossing was missing in many places. Some parents demanded action against taxi drivers who refuse to ferry passengers.

Major problems

. Illegal parking of private vehicles and taxis on the road and adjacent bridge

. Missing zebra crossing and traffic signal

. Few traffic personnel on duty

Further, it also connects the residential area with the busy Jawaharlal Nehru (J.N)Main Road.

Taking advantage of the width of the road, drivers of heavy vehicles, including tankers, park their vehicles on the road permanently to evade police patrol.

While its order was recently modified, police in Uttar Pradesh's Noida deserves a pat on the back for its bold step in preventing Friday prayers held at public parks without proper permissions. As expected, the order to industrial units in Sector 58, Noida sparked a debate, but one hoped that the move would lead to a course correction - and curb many of the ills arising from such anomalies.

Noida police's notice to industrial units within its jurisdiction said they must inform employees that they must avoid using public parks in their vicinity for religious purposes. It specifically referred to Friday prayers. The notice created a stir, with political parties and leaders promptly jumping on the bandwagon and effectively turning it into a controversy. The district magistrate and police later said that firms were not liable for public namaz by staff after the backlash.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ajay Pal Sharma had supported the order to disallow Friday prayers in the park as not being discriminatory against any particular community. He clarified that the permission to hold namaz was not granted by the district magistrate and that the police officials were merely conveying the decision to those who had congregated at the park: ""As per the Supreme Court order in 2009, to hold any religious ceremony in public place, it is essential to seek permission from the police and administration. There was no mala fide intention in the notice and the police officers were doing their duty, following the orders of the SC.""

Also read: The namaz and its significance to the Muslim community

Gautam Buddh Nagar district magistrate BN Singh while upholding the order concurred with the action of the police saying they were doing their duty.

While the order prohibited any religious activity at public parks, it did not discriminate among religions nor did it favour one religious activity over another. The order further stated that the Friday prayers are being offered without permission, in spite of the SHO specifically objecting to such activity.

All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi lashed out at Noida police and accused them of hypocrisy. Now, if the police issues a letter in the course of performing its duty in maintaining law and order, is it hypocrisy?

India is probably the only non-Islamic country where not only Muslims but also any other religious denomination can carry out their respective religious activity anywhere with, or many a time without, permission. Many instances of Friday namaz being offered on railway platforms, busy streets, airports and public parks have been reported. Such congregations greatly obstruct ordinary activities, and the free movement of people and vehicles. But owing to the secular nature of the majority of citizens, such congregations have been tolerated and, many a time, facilitated.

It is nobody's argument that there should be a blanket ban on Friday prayers. It cannot be sanctioned by the government, the courts or any other authority. It is a fundamental right enshrined in the Constitution. But all communities should remember that their religious rituals -- a part of their rights -- come with a corresponding duty.

Unfortunately, we have practically no institution that teaches civic duties and courtesies to citizens. The civics class in schools is generally dismissed as unnecessary and considered expendable. Many of our cities do not even have a provision for open parks where children can play or senior citizens can move around.

Our city planners pass building plans but seem to be lacking knowledge about free spaces and footpaths. Many of our footpaths are either illegally occupied by vendors or unusable. The same is true for places of worship. If the authorities do not want citizens to construct illegal structures as per their convenience, they must provide such avenues.

Also read: Politics over namaz inside historic Taj mosque likely to survive beyond 2019

The issue of using (or misusing) public places for religious activity is not limited to just one community or to the Friday prayers. Overnight jagrans or the construction of shamianas also require police permission -- usually accompanied by a fee, however nominal.

Industrial parks and units should follow international norms and provide separate areas for prayer along the lines of airports, which have segregated areas for smoking et al.

Given the tendency among a section of the business community to look at these facilities as a drain on investments, the government can consider tax rebates on such provisions and make them mandatory in building laws.

In any case, accusing the police of discriminating against a particular community and functioning with mala fide intention will only result in lowering its morale and directly interfere in its duties. While political parties should strictly desist from using this as an electoral issue to reach out to their vote banks, community leaders should also educate the faithful that religious freedom and duties as citizens are two sides of the same coin.

(Image for representation only). From fuelling domestic violence and poverty to lining the pockets of criminals, Albania's love of gambling has spawned a scourge of social ills in one of Europe's poorest countries.

But at the start of 2019, the Balkan state is taking a nationwide resolution to break the addiction in hopes of curbing suffering that has consumed many families.

On January 1 a law will go into effect shuttering the 4,300 betting venues that have cropped up on nearly every street corner in the country of 2.8 million people.

It is an ""extremely high"" ratio of one shop per 670 people, far above that seen in both neighbouring Balkan states and more developed Western European countries, says economist Klodian Tomorri.

The betting blackout will also outlaw online gambling and restrict casinos -- some of which are currently near schools -- to five-star hotels in licensed tourist resorts.

For people like Arta, a 31-year-old mother of two, the move is welcome although it comes too late to shield her own family from a devastating loss.

Last July her husband leapt off a building after betting for the losing team in Belgium-France football match, she recalls with tears and trembling hands.

""He bet on Belgium, but in fact, what he got was misery,"" said Arta, who is now relying on around 100 euros of monthly state aid to raise her young kids.

According to a study by the University of Tirana, one out of four gamblers have attempted suicide at least once.

Another 70 percent have struggled with stress and psychological problems.

""We also found a close link between domestic violence and gambling, which has led many families to experience very serious crises,"" said Iris Luarasi, who runs a counselling line for victims of violence.

Ilir Musta, a heavyset 35-year-old man, experienced that type of family catastrophe first hand.

""I don't know how to get out of this, please help me,"" he recently told a doctor in Tirana, where he was seeking help for anxiety.

""The game was good at first, but now it's a cancer. I lost my life, my wife, my daughter, I'm a living dead,"" added Ilir, speaking in a shaky voice as his eyes darted around the room.

He started betting on sports just two years ago, convinced he was on the verge of making a fortune.

But instead he found himself drowning in debt and ended up in prison for violently beating his wife after she asked for a divorce.

There are scores of other families who have been ruptured by the destructive addiction.

According to Tirana lawyer Vjollca Pustina, some 70 percent of divorce cases brought to court in the capital this year have been linked to gambling.

The government says rehabilitation centres will be opened to help gamblers who will be forced to quit cold turkey.

But there is concern that the centres will not be ready soon enough.

""Gambling addiction is a disease and must be managed once the betting rooms are closed for players, but for the moment rehabilitation centres are completely missing,"" said Menada Petro, professor of social sciences at the University of Durres.

The industry has also been criticised for draining money from families in a country where the average monthly salary is below 300 euros ($342).

According to official figures, Albanians spend some 140 to 150 million euros ($170 million) on sports betting annually, which amounts to 70 percent of what the average family spends on healthcare.

But when accounting for illegal betting, the real figure is estimated to be around 700 million euros ($798 million), according to the government.

For Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama, another core goal is cutting off a cash flow for organised crime groups who profit from the industry and use it to launder money.

But he admits that the new law will not end the fight against gangs, a key task for a government that wants to kickstart EU accession talks.

""The war will continue as criminals change their skin and strategy,"" Rama said in a recent TV interview.

Some betting shops already closed in December while others are trying to profit from a final year-end rush, said Artan Shyti, president of the Federation of Albanian Betting Companies.

The next battle will be controlling illegal venues, especially online.

Betting firms ""have started to move to Macedonia, Montenegro and Kosovo where they already have their subsidiaries and can operate quietly (online),"" Shyti told AFP.

Albania tried to reduce the number of betting clubs in 2013, but politics and special interests got in the way.

Now the new law, passed in October, will put some 8,000 people out of work.

""The authorities have allowed (this industry to grow) and now they are forcing us to suddenly close our business without distinguishing between clean and dirty (operations),"" says Arjan Gumi, 47, who has run small betting club in Tirana for 16 years.

He says he doesn't yet know what to do next and is hoping the government follows through on a promise to assist the unemployed.

""It is tragic for our families too,"" he added."

It was a three day extravaganza of exposure to the arts, music and dance performances, exhibitions and above all, literature. In a way, as Dr Karan Singh pointed out, it was bringing a glimpse of the rich diversity of a region of which we still do not know much. Participating in a panel discussion among writers from the region, I was asked by one of the speakers about whether I missed Shillong. The question took me back to the four years or so that I spent in the mid-1970s teaching at the North Eastern Hill University. The central university had been set up by an act of Parliament to make higher education in a variety of subjects available to students from the region and recruitment to the faculty was on an all India basis. Its first vice chancellor was Chandran Devanesen, the former principal of the Madras Christian College in Chennai. Devanesen was a well meaning and democratic soul full of love and compassion for the region in which he worked and hoped the university would fulfil the aspirations of the people.

The setting up of the university in Shillong was a crucial decision. Initially, it was hoped the university would be federal in character and not only serve the students of Shillong and Meghalaya but also the adjacent states of Mizoram and Nagaland and in time also the state of Arunachal Pradesh too where college students were affiliated to Punjab University. A few students from Assam too sought enrolment in the new university.

Shillong was a cosmopolitan town. Capital of the composite state of Assam till 1972 when the hill state of Meghalaya came into being, it was a cultural melting pot playing host to a diversity of ethnicities, both tribal and non-tribal. Apart from the native Khasis, Jaintias and Garos, it had Mizos, Nagas, Arunachalis but also significant non-tribal communities like Bengalis, Assamese, Nepalis etc. Many of them had been living and working in Shillong for long.

Shillong provided the best educational and job opportunities in the entire Northeast with some of the best schools and colleges with an excellent medium of instruction in English. There was also a strong central presence in Shillong in the form of all the Surveys which had their offices here, the Anthropological, Zoological, and Geological. It had a military presence too in the form of the Assam Rifles, the BSF and the CRP along with the headquarters of the Eastern Air Command of the Air Force and the Army 101 Area. But Shillong never became a ""garrison state"" like Kohima or Aizawl where you had the Assam Rifles or other para military organizations breathing down your necks every 100 m or so.

I enjoyed the years I spent in Shillong marked initially by communal harmony and amity and of friendships and relationships forged through mutual respect and understanding. The book Shillong Times by Nilanjan P. Choudhury speaks about friendships amid turbulent times.

Choudhury had spent his ""growing up"" years in Shillong, his schooling and possibly some college as well. The protagonist is Debu Datta a young Bengali boy who while returning home from school is set upon by some Khasi boys who called him ""Dkhar"" (foreigner or outsider). A visibly frightened Debu returns home to learn from parents that the Bengalis and other ethnic minority communities are a beleaguered lot as ethnic violence sprang up sporadically ever since the great riots of 1979. I was in Shillong that year and can say that while violence did take place and curfew had to be imposed, it was politically instigated and was nothing that the law and order agencies could not control. The situation was very similar to what happened to the Sikhs in Delhi in 1984 and or what happened in Gujarat in 2002.

Minorities tend to live in distinct ethnic clusters and Shillong was no exception. Bengalis for the most part lived in Laban, Kench's Trace and Laitumukrah, the Nepalis in Jwalapara , the Marwari businessmen in Jail Road and so on. Debu's family lived in Upper Jail Road and his father had a pharmaceutical shop in Iewheh, the Khasi name for Bara Bazar. Debu's father had been born and brought up in Shillong ever since Debu's grandfather had moved there from what is now Bangladesh.

The agitation against illegal foreign immigrants in Assam in the 1970s had its echoes in Shillong as well. As the agitation in Assam was led by students, the All Assam Students Union (AASU), so was a similar movement mounted in Shillong by the Khasi Students Union (KSU) with one notable exception. There was no large-scale influx of illegal immigrants into Shillong from Bangladesh though Meghalaya shares a common border. But the students were encouraged by vested political interests and the minorities like the Bengalis felt threatened.

Debu's family in the present times feels threatened as well. Many have to pay ""protection"" money to feel safe as is true elsewhere. The final straw comes when Debu's father's trader license cannot be renewed unless he pays a hefty sum well beyond his means. But the real story is about the friendship forged between Debu and his Khasi friends Clint Eastwood and Audrey Pariat. It's this relationship that shines through and offers a beacon of hope in troubled times.

The friendship which begins with sharing a bowl of ""jadoh"" rice with pork forbidden in Debu's home culminates in a picnic at the sacred groves in Mawphlang in Upper Shillong. Mawphlang was also the place for delectable cherry brandy distilled by a Scot in the early years. The Khasis did adopt interesting names. Clint Eastwood's father was John Wayne Lyngdoh, obviously a great fan of the actor. In my time, we had ""Mighty Sword"" Syiem because Syiem's mother had dreamed about a sword before giving birth or my own colleague in the university ""Loving Son"" Gassah.

The book has a very filmy ending. Debu decides to appeal to Clint's father, a local headman, to help save his father's shop. In the violence that ensues, Clint intervenes to save Debu's father but is severely injured instead. A contrite father rushes Clint to hospital where Clint's life is saved. But the damage is done. Debu has to complete his schooling in Kolkata under the care of a draconian aunt.

Clint's father wants to know why his own son risked his life to save that of Debu's father, a virtual stranger. A stranger indeed. It's in that understanding that the future and hope lies. We need to reach out to help our neighbours and strangers in troubled times and resist the mob mentality for acting in a mob ensures anonymity. Also, it's always the poor and helpless of all communities who suffer in any organised mob violence as the did the poor women ""kong"" fishmongers of Shillong who could no longer earn a living because of the closure of the markets."

After the gang was busted in December last year, the police said it had cheating more than 20,000 students across India and jeopardised the careers of many unsuspecting candidates who bagged government jobs using fake certificates issued by them.

On Wednesday, Rajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime branch), said at least one such candidate -- who had bagged a UP Police job using a fake degree -- had been dismissed from his job after his documents were found to be fake.

The gang ran a fake education board in the name of 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' and operated from west Delhi's Vikaspuri, said the DCP..

Police said the gang was busted for a second time on December 12 after the crime branch received a tip-off about the 'Board of Higher Secondary Education, Delhi' , said Rajeev Ranjan, additional commissioner of police (crime branch). ""We were already working on a similar recent complaint from the Directorate of Education,"" Ranjan said.

The first person to be arrested was 23-year-old Altaf Raza, who was one of the six persons nabbed last year as well. The police said he was ""one of the masterminds"" of the racket. ""We arrested him on a day he was to appear at a court hearing in the previous case,"" said DCP Deo.

Raza had allegedly learnt the trade from one Shiv Prasad Pandey a few years ago. Pandey was arrested with Raza last year. After coming out on bail, he has gone underground, said the DCP.

The other two men arrested in the latest case are Shambhu Nath Mishra and Manoj Kumar, who run a school in Uttar Pradesh's Deoria and were allegedly involved in scouting for potential candidates as well as schools in desperate need for recognition certificates.

""The gang promised to provide marksheets and degrees of Class 10 and 12 in two-three months without any tests or requirements. The documents provided were fake,"" said DCP Deo.

Each time their website was busted, the gang would allegedly come up with a new portal with a different name.

The police claimed to have recovered a large number of fake marksheets, provisional certificates and migration certificates. ""In their last few months of operation, the gang had cheated more than 10,000 students from Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Bihar,"" said the DCP.

The gang allegedly charged anywhere between Rs 2,000 and Rs 5,000 for fake certificates and marksheets. That, investigators said, allowed them to operate easily as their victims rarely approached the police because of the relatively small sum of money involved."

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's order to the administration to immediately take care of stray cows is one more bit of evidence that the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP's) cow-protection posture is unviable unless the entire lifecycle chain of cattle is taken care of. Thanks to the new political pressures for cow protection in much of the Hindi belt, the old wink-and-nod system of the illegal cow economy is breaking down.

The current cow economy is partly illegal because when you ban slaughter, there is no one to take care of the cow once its useful economic life is over. The number of gaushalas and good Hindus willing to finance cow shelters is small relative to the need. There is thus a don't-see-don't-tell system in place where the original buyer of the cow takes care of it until it stops yielding milk; after that, it is quietly sold off to middlemen, who then 'smuggle' the cow for slaughter in illegal slaughter houses inside the country, or across porous borders in Nepal and Bangladesh. Along the way, various protection racketeers collect speed money to let cattle pass through. It is the breakdown of this system that is one contributory cause of cow vigilantism and violence.

Now that it is tougher to continue with this wink-and-nod arrangement of ordinary cow owners being complicit in its slaughter, most people just let them loose, and bands of stray cows now wander about the countryside damaging crops and other vegetation. In Rajasthan, and now UP, villagers spend sleepless nights to ensure that armies of cows don't damage their crops before they are harvested. Without a proper policy, cow protection is a curse for them.

One need not buy the beef lobby's argument about right to eat, or that cow protection laws are an imposition on others who have no qualms about eating its meat. It is perfectly logical for any state, whether driven by the sentiments of the people, or for other reasons, to ban the slaughter of specific animals. As sociologist Dipankar Gupta wrote in The Times of India some time ago, many countries ban the consumption of specific types on meat (dogs in Germany, Britain, Ireland, France), even if the reason is not religious. And ""when a law prohibits the consumption, or slaughter, of a certain animal, then it applies to every citizen, without exception"".

To put it plainly, the ban on cow slaughter is not as illogical as some claim; what is illogical is to not think through the consequences of the ban, and investing in an ecosystem to ensure smooth policing and implementation of the ban. We need a new legal approach to taking care of the cow from birth to death. If this is not done, it will cost the BJP dear, and merely ordering district officials to take care of cows will not instantly solve the problem. There are reports that stray cows are being housed in schools, which cannot be a long-term solution, unless we want to stop educating our children and send them to school only to take care of cows.

So, what should a holistic cow protection economy look like? There can be many solutions, but one needs address the follow issues.

First, size of herd. Assuming the state and citizens have to provide for cows till moksha, it does not make sense to allow the cattle population to proliferate endlessly. We need to look at an optimum size that can be protected and economically supported. Unlike humans, who automatically control populations once they achieve a certain degree of economic prosperity, cattle may continue to proliferate if they are well taken care of. Hence the need to have limits on how many millions we want in terms of the country's cattle population. If we can afford only so much, we should allow only so many to be born.

Second, the male problem. Since nature produces males and females in equal number among cattle, and males are not pretty much of use beyond insemination, we need an answer on what to do with male cattle. Should we allow sex determination tests - banned for humans for good reason - so that too many male cows are not born, and thus needing slaughter? Or should male cows in adulthood head straight for the pensioners' gaushala?

Third, research. If we are going to invest in many gaushalas, it is logical to look for many more uses of the cow beyond milk and leather. This calls for research to derive additional value from cow side-products (medicinal properties of urine, use of gobar for gas and power, etc), and also investment in cow-care in old age. Investment in bovine veterinary facilities, medicine and food are vital so that old cattle can live in peace.

Fourth, use of leather and other parts after death. The Hindu restriction is only on cow slaughter, not use of its parts after death. While few Hindus may want to cut up cows even after they died in their sleep or of cardiac arrest, there are entire communities that have no issue doing this. Why not integrate the Muslim community both at the veterinary and caretaking end, and in the skinning of dead animals, so that they too are benefited? Will this not improve communal harmony? Open collaboration between the two communities in protection and disposal of the cow is better than covert collaboration on the slaughter of live animals which is illegal in 24 states, and often leads to violence.

Fifth, policing and cow census. If you want a ban, you must have effective policing and intimate knowledge of the cow population. If you don't have this, you will have cow vigilantism and protection rackets that will sometimes turn violent. The police also cannot track all cows in the country; so, a system of licensing and birth registration is vital, so that the cow buyers will think twice while buying a cow only for its useful life, without taking responsibility for it when it becomes economically a burden. We don't sell our pet dogs for slaughter when they get old, nor do we do that with old grandma even though her poor health may be draining the family's wealth. For those who say the cow is our mother, maybe they should consider providing for her like they would for a mother.

While we do have regular censuses of livestock (the last one happened in 2014), it would make sense to have an even more granular understanding of the cattle population district-wise, village-wise, and age- and gender-wise. This will enable us to generate actuarial information over time which can be useful in estimating demand for gaushalas or other services.

In this context, an Aadhaar number for cows is not a laughing matter. If we can register millions of cars and bikes every year (over 20 million of them annually), and provide for their licensing and ultimate junking, why not apply the same logic for the cow?

Sixth, it is worthwhile. Naysayers will ask: why spend so much on cows when we still have so many poor? The answer is we must spend on the cow precisely because we must help the poor. The cow economy will provide thousands of new jobs in the countryside, and create its own supply chain of services. It will be economically viable at some point.

It is worth repeating: protecting the cow is not wrong in itself; it is the avoidance of responsibility for the ban that is the problem. The BJP will pay a high price politically for trying to milk the cow for votes, and then abandoning it to ruin the lives of those who buy it for economic benefits."

Adding, ""These are the areas in which Indian companies have the technology and expertise of executing projects in India as well in other parts of the world such as in Africa, South and South East Asia.""

As reported by The Financial Express Online earlier, India had offered Colombia help in reconstruction following the end of 52 years of civil war, as part of a diplomatic drive in South America.

To a question if any new opportunities have emerged for the Indian Oil companies, the source pointed out that ""The end of FARC conflict should open up exploration in new areas and basins that previously had a permanent FARC presence (for example, in parts of Caquetá and Putumayo).""

""Oil companies operating in Colombia plan to invest almost $5 billion next year, up 14 percent from this year. Oil companies invested $4.35 billion in 2018, most of which went into production and some $800 million into exploration,"" the source said.

The industry in Colombia feels that exploration needs to be increased since investment remains at historically low levels with only 1,100 square kilometres of seismic tests undertaken.

Colombia has faced challenges to its oil industry that are unique in light of decades of internal armed conflict. Since the mid-1980s, guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN), and subsequently the FARC, have relentlessly attacked oil installations and personnel through kidnappings, extortion, and sabotage of oil pipelines.

One of the key objectives of peace, as articulated by the government of that country is to empower communities that have been abandoned by the state and subject to the influence of illegal armed groups.

According to the source, ""Many communities in oil producing regions are already quite active in expressing their grievances. This situation is unlikely to change; in fact, protests and work stoppages could actually increase as fear recedes."" The local government has not awarded new areas for exploration in the last four years. The South American nation's proven oil reserves were 1.78 billion barrels at the end of 2017, equivalent to 5.7 years of consumption.

Colombia has cancelled two auctions of rights to explore for oil in dozens of areas and plans to re-launch bidding early next year. Former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos and the leader of FARC, Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri, alias 'Timochenko', in 2016 had inked an accord setting out the timetable for FARC to lay down arms and become a political organisation.

The FARC is now a political party and several members have taken seats in parliament as part of the peace terms. The FARC's fighters have demobilised and handed in their weapons, the group has turned itself into a political party and taken up seats in parliament. However, hundreds of FARC guerrillas refused to sign up the deal and are still at large. They have also been joined by other dissidents, disillusioned with the pace of implementation. Another challenge the government in that country faces is that drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by FARC guerrillas.

President Iván Duque Márquez of Colombia, reiterating that he remains committed to Colombia's peace process, had in his inaugural address on Aug 7, extended the olive branch to peace and promised to look for opportunities for ex-guerrillas and the provision of resources for the entire country and especially for areas that have been hit by violence."

In the early hours of 9 December 2018, Video Volunteer Community Correspondent Amit Topno was found murdered in Ghaghra area of Jharkhand, India. Topno, an Adivasi (indigenous) inhabitant of the conflict-prone region of Khunti, Jharkhand, had been with Video Volunteers (VV) since 2012, reported for Newscode and OK Times, and most recently drove a taxi for Ola Cab.

Topno reported fearlessly on issues like sand mining, illegal alcohol sales, Adivasi rights, education, sanitation, human trafficking, land rights, culture and most recently the Pathalgadi movement. His last report for VV was produced six months ago on the Pathalgadi, a movement in which Adivasi communities across Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh asserted their right to self-governance. The movement has its roots in creating awareness and ensuring implementation of the key provisions of the Panchayats (Extensions Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that empower a village as an administrative unit.

Besides being a community journalist, Topno was a social activist too. He followed up his video reports with on-the-ground action to solve the problem he was reporting. He held community screenings, conducted village meetings, assisted the community in writing applications and approaching government officials and worked towards ensuring accountability. It made schools safer and encouraged the administration to deal with issues like the human-animal conflict in the area. He is remembered by those who knew him as an inquisitive, warm, fun loving and an extremely helpful and courageous individual. In a 2015 interview, Topno said:

Jharkhand is a land caught up in a frightful storm. Its people are being whirled around in a storm of starvation, conflict, and poverty. I am the headman of my village, Nichitpur, Jharkhand, and I'm tired of seeing my people die,"" said Amit in an interview in 2014.

Topno's body was found on the Namkum-Doranda road in Ranchi on 9 December. The autopsy report reveals that he was shot twice and one of the bullets was still lodged in. The autopsy report also states that there were no signs of struggle or scuffle, not even a scratch. His taxi, phone and identity cards were missing but money was not. No weapon was recovered from the scene of the crime. All of this points to a pre-meditated and professionally executed murder. Over 11 days have passed since his murder and no arrests have been made in the case yet -- though the police have said that they are closing on some leads.

On 14 December, more than a 100 people, including social movement leaders, activists, journalists, students and members of the VV network participated in a silent candlelight march to protest his murder. At the march, Jerrome Kujur, Dayamani Barla, Deepak Bara spoke out about the frequent threats and harassment of activists and journalists in Jharkhand. They urged the state to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and bring Amit Topno's murderers to justice.

On 15 December 2018, a delegation of civil society organisations including VV met the superintendent of police and urged him to conduct a thorough and speedy investigation into Topno's murder. The SSP assured that all possible angles will be investigated.

On 17 December 2018, the Jharkhand Jantantrik Mahasabha organised a peaceful protest in Jamshedpur. Friends and allies of Amit also submitted an application to the National Scheduled Tribe Commission urging them to take note of the gruesome murder. Civil society organisations appraised this matter to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand government and other ministers on 19 December 2018. Arup Chatterjee, an MLA from Nirsa Dhanbad, was handed over documents related to Topno's work and he has promised to raise the issue in the upcoming winter session of the assembly starting on 24th December.

Though Topno did not inform his colleagues of any threats to him in the last 18 months, it cannot be ruled out that he was murdered because of his work as a journalist and social activist, raising issues affecting communities on the margins and working in an area where conflict over land resources is rife. In November 2018, another journalist from the same area was murdered. At a time when India ranks 14th on the Global Impunity Index, Topno's murder is a reminder that journalists who speak truth to power and report out of remote, rural areas are not safe."

While an all-India judicial service with an exam-based intake at the entry level has been proposed in the past and Prasad has spoken on the need for the judiciary to be more representative, the minister referred to SC/ST quotas at the entry level in judicial services at a function organised by the All India Lawyers Board in Lucknow on Monday.

The minister told TOI on Tuesday, ""The judicial services examination, if conducted by the Union Public Service Commission, can be on the lines of the intake for the civil services where there is reservation for SCs and STs. Those selected can be allotted states to serve in and reservation will create opportunities for well-trained judicial officers from deprived sections who will, over time, rise to higher positions.""

The minister did not mention reservation for other backward classes, but going by the UPSC model for all-India civil services, there would be provision for OBCs as well in keeping with the Supreme Court-mandated implementation of the Mandal Commission's recommendations.

""A well organised judicial service can attract talent from our law schools and young, well-informed judicial officers at the level of additional district judge will make a difference. As ADJs and district judges, they can help make the judicial system move faster and more efficiently,"" Prasad said.

Food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the move to introduce a judicial service with provision for reservations for weaker sections was welcome and would meet a long-pending demand.

Though Prasad has brought up the need for an all-India judicial service to address the vacancies and expansion of lower courts, the judicial and legal fraternity has been lukewarm to the proposal. The minister's fresh push comes at a time when the Centre has been seeking a breakthrough on the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for appointment of judges to constitutional courts. The MoP has been stuck over the higher judiciary's reluctance to accept a screening committee for candidates and the inclusion of 'national security' as a ground for the Centre to reject a candidate proposed by the collegiums.

The government has also been unhappy with the Supreme Court's decision not to take up cases like the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi title suit expeditiously while disposing of contentious issues like entry of women of a certain age to the Sabarimala shrine, de-criminalising gay sex and making triple talaq illegal."

When Myanmar security forces launched its now notorious ""clearance operations"" in western Rakhine state in August 2017, it was not the first time the country's Rohingya Muslim minority had fled en masse into neighboring Bangladesh.

But a failed attempt to repatriate a first group to Myanmar in November and the construction of solid, concrete buildings on an island off the Bangladeshi coast signal an entirely new situation is emerging: a Palestine-like scenario with a permanent, stateless and impoverished refugee population ripe for exploitation by extremist groups in South and Southeast Asia.The dailyReport Must-reads from across Asia - directly to your inbox

More than 720,000 Rohingyas fled Myanmar's brutal security force crackdown, adding to another few hundred thousand that were already in Bangladesh. The United Nations has indicated the forced expulsion represented crimes against humanity and may have been driven by ""genocidal intent.""

A first batch of 2,200 refugees was supposed to have been repatriated on November 15, but none agreed to return if their demands for citizenship and justice for the atrocities they had been subjected to were met.

That, of course, was a non-starter as the government in Naypyitaw is highly unlikely to grant the Rohingya, who they consider illegal migrants from Bangladesh, citizenship or accept responsibility for an offensive security officials say was a legitimate response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on border guard posts.

Myanmar's military leaders, now struggling to stay out of the reach of The Hague's International Criminal Court, where they could potentially face genocide charges for their 2017 crackdown, have not faced any moves domestically to seek justice for the widespread death and destruction.

Plans to relocate as many as 100,000 Rohingya refugees to Bangladesh's Bhasan Char Island would ease pressure on the overcrowded camps on the Myanmar border, but it is unclear how refugees with few skills and no resources would survive on a small, isolated and barren island located in one of the world's most cyclone-prone areas.

Construction on the island is reportedly proceeding apace, although no relocation is expected to take place before Bangladesh's general election on December 30. Rohingya refugees are already reportedly reluctant to move to the island.

The election will also decide whether the more secular Awami League remains in power, or if the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party, which includes among its top allies Islamic groups such as the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, will take over.

The situation today is in sharp contrast to 1978 and 1991-1992, when hundreds of thousands of Rohingyas similarly fled persecution to Bangladesh. In 1978, the Myanmar government launched an operation code-named Naga Min, or King of Dragons, which aimed at identifying illegal immigrants across the country.

The campaign began in Kachin and Shan states, where many Chinese were believed to have taken shelter, but it quickly turned into a massive violent crackdown on the Rohingyas when the military reached Rakhine state.

Despite reports of rape, arson and murder, the then ruling military got support from even its most vocal domestic critics, who shared the view that the Rohingyas are not indigenous but rather ""Bengali settlers"" from Bangladesh.

An estimated 200,000 Rohingyas fled across the border, but were allowed to return when Myanmar and Bangladesh, after a stream of protests mainly from Islamic countries leading to intervention by the United Nations, reached an agreement in July 1978.

Many, however, filtered back into Bangladesh when they found that their old homes in Myanmar had been razed and their land had been taken over by new ethnic Burman or Rakhine settlers. In early 1991, thousands of Rohingyas once again began streaming across the border, bringing with them tales of forcible eviction from their homes, and the destruction of mosques and Islamic schools.

By 1992, more than 200,000 refugees were living in makeshift camps across the border in Bangladesh until a repatriation agreement was reached under the auspices of the United Nations. During the 1992 crisis, Prince Khaled Sultan Abdul Aziz, commander of the Saudi contingent in the 1991 Gulf War, visited Dhaka and lashed out against the Myanmar government for its persecution of the Rohingyas.

Then, he publicly recommended a ""Desert Storm-like"" action against Myanmar, similar to the US military intervention that liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation. No such action was taken against Myanmar, but it was a clear sign of the wider Muslim world's interest in the Rohingyas plight.

The first was in 1978, when the immensely wealthy Saudi Arabian charity Rabitat-al-Alam-al-Islami sent aid to the refugees and built a hospital, mosque and madrasa for them at Ukhia, south of Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh.

Rohingya refugees react as aid is distributed in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, September 21, 2017. Photo: Reuters/Cathal McNaughton

Saudi religious teachers were sent to Ukhia, and the radicalization of some Rohingya leaders and activists began. In the 1980s and early 1990s, the Rohingya Solidarity Organization (RSO), the main militant group among them, forged links with the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and, especially, its even more radical youth wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir.

With those new connections, the RSO also contacted Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hizb-e-Islami in Afghanistan and likeminded organizations in Pakistan, the Middle East and Southeast Asia. Afghan instructors were even sent to RSO's camp near Ukhia, while about a hundred RSO militants went to Afghanistan to undergo military training with Hizb-e-Islami in the province of Khost.

Today's main political and military organization among the Rohingyas, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) or, as it is better known locally, Harakah al-Yaqin -- the Faith Movement -- has its roots in radical milieus in Karachi, Pakistan.

There, several hundred thousand first, second and third generation Rohingyas, many descendants of Muslims who left Myanmar after World War II, live in impoverished suburbs. Nearly all of them are stateless, although they have lived in Pakistan for generations, with most of them born in the country.

The areas where the Rohingya live in Karachi have long served as hotbeds for extremist activities; many were among those recruited to fight in the wars in Afghanistan. ARSA's leader, Ataullah abu Ammar Junjuni, also known as Hafiz Tohar, was born in Karachi and received madrasa education in Saudi Arabia.

According to recent reports from the camps in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen (JMB), an Islamic organization operating in Bangladesh which is listed as a terror group in the United Kingdom, is bidding to cultivate links with the Rohingyas.

JMB is believed to have been involved in several bomb attacks in Bangladesh and its stated aim is to replace the country's democracy with an Islamic state based on Sharia law.

It is uncertain to what extent the group has been able to link up with militants among the Rohingyas, but the Bangladesh Daily Star reported on December 13 that the country's Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit had arrested three JMB members who were ""providing training to Rohingya refugees.""

A CTTC official was quoted as saying that the JMB has ""been working in the Rohingya camps"" with its military chief ""providing training to refugees since 2016."" Those accusations could augur a militant response when Myanmar's civil and military authorities refuse to yield to the demands of the refugees, including their calls for citizenship and justice.

The radicalization of Rohingyas, which began in the late 1970s, is bound to continue in the current Palestine-like situation. Analysts say that could lead to more ARSA cross-border raids, similar to the ones in August last year that prompted the Myanmar military to unleash its campaign of terror in Rohingya-inhabited areas of northern Rakhine state.

A permanent refugee population in Bangladesh, and possible alliances between various groups of militants, could also have grave implications for the domestic security situation in that country, similar to the volatility seen in Lebanon and other Middle Eastern countries where Palestinian refugees have been languishing for more than half a century.

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Even the giant teddy bear at the mall entrance wasn't spared, said Ma Jun, who works at a tutoring company in the building.

""Everything is gone and cleaned,"" she said.

Christmas continues to be a shopping festival across most of China, with huge trees adorning shopping malls in Shanghai and Beijing, but a growing emphasis on traditional culture by the ruling Communist Party and the systematic suppression of religion under President Xi Jinping are imperiling Santa Claus's position.

At least four Chinese cities and one county have ordered restrictions on Christmas celebrations this year, according to official notices and interviews. Students, teachers and parents from 10 schools around China said Christmas celebrations have been curtailed.

""The ongoing local reaction against Christmas is part of the wider sentiment since Xi took power,"" said Zi Yang, a China expert at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

Xi is trying to broaden the appeal of the Communist Party by casting it as a crusader for Chinese tradition in a fast-changing world, he said. ""Therefore, foreign cultural elements such as Christmas are placed on the chopping block.""

The seasonal humbug follows similar outbreaks of anti-Christmas rhetoric in 2014 and 2017. It appears not to be centrally organised, but rather a spreading resistance to foreign festivals by local authorities seeking to align themselves with the growing tide of cultural nationalism.

The squeeze on Christmas is an example of how efforts to ""normalise"" thinking bleed into the everyday lives of many Chinese. That push exploded into view this year through re-education camps for Uighur Muslims and a crackdown on Christian churches that has continued with force in recent weeks.

In Nanyang, about 950 kilometers (600 miles) west of Shanghai, government officials stopped by the office and shopping complex on 16 December to say that Christmas decorations would have to come down, said Ma, the tutoring company employee.

An official from the city's urban management bureau hung up when asked for comment.

Nine hours by car south, Hengyang, a city in Hunan province, said in a 19 December notice posted on an official government social media account that anyone caught holding Christmas sales or celebrations that blocked the streets would be punished. Communist Party members, the notice said, should avoid foreign festivals and instead be ""models of adherence to Chinese traditional culture."" Hengyang police posted a video on their official social media account of locals discussing the importance of Chinese culture and plans to avoid ostentatious Christmas celebrations.

Langfang city, just south of Beijing, banned Christmas stage performances and merchandising promotions, according to a notice circulated on social media.

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up 23-25 December to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers (167 miles) west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the 21 December announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities.

""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said.

Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan ($290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

The central government issued guidelines last year for a cultural revival project that calls for a marked boost in the international influence of Chinese traditional culture by 2025.

""You have a culturally conservative ethos in the country that has definitely been encouraged by the central party-state,"" said Guo Yingjie, a professor of Chinese studies at the University of Sydney. ""It's not hard for university presidents or officials to say, 'OK celebrating Christmas can easily be seen as de-Sinification or promoting Western culture.'""

Students have taken to social media to complain about restrictions on Christmas celebrations at their schools.

At a top Shanghai university, a student union had its Christmas plans cancelled for the first time, an organizer told the AP on condition of anonymity, fearing rebuke.

The students came up with a solution: By replacing ""Christmas"" with ""New Year's"" in their activity proposal and changing the date from 25 December, it sailed past school administrators.

Students in the city of Qingdao were reprimanded for hosting an event about gratitude on Thanksgiving Day and warned not to celebrate Christmas publicly, according to a student, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution.

Liu Kaiming, president of the Institute of Contemporary Observation, a civil society group in the city of Shenzhen, said that despite the drumbeat of official discontent, Christmas cheer continues to spread in China.

""The sound of resistance is more powerful on the surface, but it has no practical effect,"" he said. ""Young people's enthusiasm for the festival is ever-increasing.""

Shop windows were to be stripped of Christmas stickers and streets kept free of Christmas banners and lights. Law enforcement patrols were to be stepped up Dec. 23-25 to prevent illegal signs of celebration.

The Langfang urban management bureau declined comment. The state-run Global Times newspaper argued that Western media are exaggerating China's crackdown on Christmas and reported that the restrictions in Langfang were aimed not at Christmas but at cleaning up roadside stalls and migrant vendors in hopes of winning a ""National Civilized City"" award from the Communist Party.

Some 270 kilometers west, Fuping county, also in Hebei province, issued a similar clean-up notice. Though the December 21 announcement mentions Christmas eleven times, an official from the Fuping urban management bureau said the rules were aimed at street vendors generally, not Christmas.

Police in the Panlong district of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province in southern China, circulated a notice that hotels, karaoke parlors, internet cafes, bars and other crowded places must prohibit Christmas-related decorations and activities. ""It is forbidden to hang Christmas stockings, wear Christmas hats, place Christmas trees, and so on,"" the notice read.

It wasn't clear if the notice applied to all of Kunming city, though a police officer told the AP that the order to circulate it came from city officials.

Reverend Jonathan Liu, founder of the Chinese Christian Fellowship of Righteousness, a California nonprofit, said the pushback against Christmas reflects Xi's efforts to ""Sinicize"" religion.

Preachers are coached on how to convey Communist Party core values in their sermons and national flags and songs have been injected into some church services, he said. Liu provided the AP with a notice sent to churches in Zhoukou, a city to the east of Nanyang in Henan province.

It tells churches to vet Christmas plans with the government, forbids minors from participating in Christmas events and caps expenses at 2000 yuan (USD 290). ""I wish you all a happy Christmas! God bless you,"" read the notice, which Liu received from a pastor in China.

An official at the United Front Work Department in Zhoukou referred queries to the religious affairs bureau, which could not be reached for comment.

Before becoming president, Xi went to Finland in 2010 and was photographed with Santa Claus. That kind of chumminess appears to be a thing of Christmas past, experts say.

Unlike a majority of the schools in the city, the Green Acres Academy is located on a road that was opened to the general public as recently as six months ago. Though the school takes its fair share of measures to minimise traffic congestion in front of the school's entrance, local residents complain that parents of students often park in front of their society's gates while they wait for their children.

The school currently has students from class I to class VII. The administration has implemented a system wherein students who have opted for the bus service board the school buses that are parked on either side of the road at 2:45 pm. The remaining students who are picked up by their parents have to wait inside the school building and are allowed to leave only after the school buses have departed by 3:15 pm. During this time, vehicles pile up in front of the school gate and traffic moves slowly for a period of 15-20 minutes.

The narrow road which is close to housing societies

Parents voiced their concern about children crossing the road to board the buses even as cars drive by disregarding the school guard. The problems increase during the monsoon season when parents tend to park as close as possible to the gate to ensure their children don't get wet in the rain which adds to the traffic congestion. The school will soon extend its classes till class X and local residents feel that a higher number of students will inevitably add to the traffic problem.

The school is located on a road that connects SG Barve Marg and Ramakrishna Chemburkar Marg which allows residents of Chembur and Kurla to use Sion-Trombay Road to move towards the Eastern Freeway.

Until six months ago, the road was private and blocked by a wall. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), however, demolished the wall and the road was thrown open to traffic. Local residents are now concerned that once more people start using this road, and the increasing number of students, the traffic issues will get worse.

DirectorSpeak

Aaditya Lohana,

Executive director of the school

'Our system is not very different from that followed by thousands of schools across the country. We have segregated the timings. Parents who come to pick up their children have been given a separate time which is after school buses have left. Parents park their vehicles 300-400 metres away and then walk to the school gate. Most neighbours have no concerns. But we are harassed by a self-interested group of people. We always follow laws and will continue to do so and provide the best education for the children of Chembur'

PoliceSpeak

Dr Saurabh Tripathi,

Deputy Commissioner of Police

'Parking in front of the gate is illegal and we will look into the issue. But as part of the long-term planning of the road will be taken up with local resident groups and school administration. If the school has additional students then additional parking to accommodate vehicles will also have to be arranged'

Voices

Ashwini Prabhu,

A parent

'Earlier this road was closed so there were no safety concerns for the children. But now vehicles use the road when children walk towards their buses. All buses should be parked on the same side as the school gate so that kids don't have to cross the road at all.'

Vishnu Shelar,

A shopkeeper

'When the school begins and ends, the traffic lasts for about half an hour, but clears up quickly. But parents park their cars in front of the gates of residential buildings which is inconvenient for people in the morning when they have to leave for work.'

Hemal Shah,

A local resident

'This used to be a service road. But after our society complained to the BMC as drunkards loitered in the area, they broke the wall and it was opened up. The parents must understand that there is a traffic issue here. They should opt for school buses instead of coming to pick up their children in cars. The traffic police should mark no parking zones. There are no proper footpaths which makes it difficult for pedestrians.'

Major problems

* Parents park their vehicles in front of the gates of residential buildings near the school

* Children cross the road to board their buses

* School van drivers take a long queue of students down the road to board vehicle

* Residents are concerned of the near future when more people find that the road is open to the public"

Bhardwaj said let people of Delhi ask what work their seven MPs, who belong to BJP, did for the city.

""Amit Shah has rightly started comparing AAP's Delhi Government with the Modi Government with respect to Delhi. Let people of Delhi ask what work their seven MPs did for Delhi. Let people of Delhi know they contributed to increasing the fare of Metro, they did nothing to stop sealing in city.

""They could have brought an ordinance to immediately stop sealing but they did nothing. Their central government's contribution for Delhi was to stall all public welfare schemes in Delhi through their LG,"" he alleged.

The attack on AAP came after the party sought to distance itself from the resolution, which it said, did not have official backing. The BJP chief accused the ruling party in Delhi of being insincere.

Shah also targeted Congress, saying perpetrators of the anti-Sikh riots were presenting themselves as protectors while also criticising the party for protecting illegal immigrants, a reference to the main opposition's stance on the issue of the National Register of Citizens in Assam.

""The lies of Arvind Kejriwal and Rahul Gandhi outweigh all the lies spoken since independence in the country. The victims of the 1984 riots did not get justice till now because perpetrators of the riots were being protected.

(Written by Norimitsu Onishi and Selam Gebrekida)

India's most influential guru joined thousands of believers four years ago as the temple's first stone was set in the ground.

It was a glorious day for its builders, the Gupta brothers, the sons of a local shopkeeper who had risen, almost magically, to become one of the richest families a world away in South Africa.

The three brothers had flown back on their private jet to start work on the temple, a 125-foot monument of pink sandstone and white marble.

Advertising

But one morning last month, as the sun struggled to break through the smog in Saharanpur, their hometown in India's north, the giant yellow crane raising the temple stood still -- in limbo, like the brothers themselves.

The Guptas are now in self-imposed exile in Dubai, evading arrest in South Africa, where they stand at the centre of a scandal that has already brought down the nation's president and exposed staggering amounts of corruption in the once-legendary party of Nelson Mandela.

Even here in India, the family's legacy -- so large that it has been elevated to myth -- faces collapse. The new temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in their father's honour, is now being investigated for the same kind of self-dealing and fraud the family is accused of mastering in South Africa.

The rise and fall of the Gupta brothers is so improbable that in Saharanpur their story is told like a parable.

They began by selling shoes in South Africa and swiftly became central figures in the nation's post-apartheid history, outsiders who broke into the very pinnacle of political power. Seemingly overnight, they joined the ranks of South Africa's most influential families, playing a leading role in one of the biggest dramas after the end of apartheid: Who is getting rich, and how?

Mandela's election as president in 1994 set off a scramble by leaders in his party, the African National Congress, to amass wealth. The early ones succeeded through ties with rich white South Africans. Many others turned to the brothers from Saharanpur.

The Guptas found eager partners at all levels of the ANC, from bureaucrats to a sitting president, Jacob Zuma, according to dozens of interviews by The New York Times, as well as government investigators, international auditors, emails from a Gupta company, financial records and court documents.

Seizing on a chance encounter with a South African official in India decades ago, the three brothers cultivated ties to the governing party so expertly that it became difficult to draw the line between their business empire and the president's office.

They made one of Zuma's sons a business partner, enabling them to buy a coal mine through government intervention and set up a media business that the president helped guide himself, according to officials, company emails and people involved in the ventures. The president responded in kind, handing them control over strategic Cabinet selections and the boards of state-owned enterprises.

Now desperate to distance themselves from the brothers, ANC leaders dismiss the family as a legacy of the tainted era of Zuma, who was ousted in February by his own party.

But the story of the Guptas -- who landed in the country a year before the end of apartheid in 1994 and left with Zuma's fall -- is also the story of South Africa under the ANC.

The main agent of corruption was the party itself. ANC leaders have siphoned off tens of billions of dollars meant to improve the lives of their most loyal supporters, poor black South Africans.

They have crippled strong government agencies, like the national tax service, to benefit their own bank accounts. Some of the nation's new leaders -- the ANC officials promising a new chapter for the country now that Zuma is out of office -- have pocketed money intended for basic services, like schools.

The Guptas helped undermine the nation's democratic institutions. And like generations of foreigners before them, they took their windfall out of Africa, moving it to Dubai and India through a maze of dubious, and at times illegal, transactions, officials say.

And they became so powerful that they clashed with the Oppenheimers -- the family that once owned the De Beers diamond company and the mining giant Anglo American -- whose influence in South Africa had been unrivalled for a century.

But as the Guptas brandished their power, they incited a backlash, not only from ordinary South Africans, but also from a far more powerful constituency: the white-led business establishment and its allies, both increasingly worried that the brothers were putting the country's economic health at risk.

The Guptas' intimate role in steering the nation helped set off an electoral revolt that has already cost the ANC control over South Africa's biggest cities and could jeopardize its hold on the presidency.

From his self-imposed exile in Dubai, Ajay Gupta, 53, the oldest brother, denies all wrongdoing. He points out that they face no criminal charges in South Africa, adding that their family empire is now bankrupt.

Humble Beginnings

The father of the Gupta brothers, Shiv Kumar Gupta, owned a tiny shop that sold government rations, or subsidized food, here in Saharanpur. But he nurtured grand ambitions.

One day, Gupta called over his oldest son, Ajay, to recount a newspaper article on the war between Iran and Iraq. The price of rice had skyrocketed there because he told his son, all the traders had left the countries.

""But somebody is going in,"" the father said, Ajay recalled. ""He's getting this advantage because there's no competition.""

So Ajay, who had already set up a computer import business in New Delhi, followed his father's advice and went looking for opportunities in Russia, China and Singapore.

The middle brother, Atul, went to South Africa in 1993, right before it became a democracy. He kept going back, despite his family's misgivings.

""He alone was the bullish one,"" Ajay recalled. ""He loved the place.""

Atul settled in Johannesburg and sold shoes downtown. Then he started a company importing computer parts and assembling them for sale. And by chance, he made a personal connection to the ANC that would prove far more consequential.

During a trip home to India, Atul met a South African of Indian origin in New Delhi: Essop Pahad, the right-hand man of Thabo Mbeki, who was then Mandela's deputy.

Planting New Roots

When Pahad met Ajay, he was immediately impressed. Ajay got the big picture in South Africa, and seemed to understand that there was a place in it for the Guptas. In fact, the opening was vast, and Ajay exploited it masterfully.

In the late 1990s, as Mbeki prepared to become president, the ANC government was worried about the enduring power of white South African businessmen and dependence on Western nations. Forging ties with countries like India and China could lessen their influence, Pahad said.

Black South Africans had gained political power. But the white business elite, led by officials at Anglo American, had protected its own interests in the new South Africa. Long before the end of apartheid, Harry Oppenheimer, the head of the mining company, had led efforts to create -- and co-opt, some historians say -- a black elite.

When Mandela was released from Robben Island in 1990, Anglo American executives visited him at his home in Soweto. Other businessmen followed, to Mandela's delight, according to an authorized biography describing how he stayed at the estates of white tycoons and accepted gifts from them.

Mandela was particularly close to Oppenheimer, who gave him money, said Michael Spicer, a former executive at the company.

Oppenheimer put together a team of economic advisers for Mandela. In meetings, ANC leaders joined the country's top white businessmen to set the nation's post-apartheid economic course, Spicer said.

Soon enough, Mandela, who had supported nationalizing the economy, endorsed pro-business policies. Some historians argue that the policies contributed to South Africa's income inequality, and to an economy still based on cheap black labor.

But after becoming president, Mbeki moved to dampen the power of white businesses. He created his own group, which met at his residence each month, Pahad said. It included Cabinet ministers, top businessmen, rising stars in the ANC and an unknown figure: Ajay Gupta.

Ajay said he enjoyed the meetings. Mbeki sometimes even dropped by for lunch. Only a few years after settling in South Africa, Ajay had forged links to the highest levels of the ANC, thanks to his friendship with Pahad.

In the early 2000s, the brothers got their first big break: They won a large government contract to set up computer laboratories in schools in the nation's richest province.

Then they went on a buying spree, acquiring a struggling information technology company that helped them become one of the biggest computer distributors in South Africa. They later bought a uranium mine, a steel manufacturer and other businesses.

Hedging Their Bets

Even as the Guptas thrived off their ties to Mbeki's allies, they were reaching out to his archrival, Zuma, the No. 2 in the party.

The two leaders fought bitterly. So Pahad, Mbeki's right-hand man, was surprised to learn that the Guptas had cultivated ties with the other side.

""They were having some function at their home, and Ajay said to me, 'Do you mind if we invite Zuma?'"" Pahad recalled.

Money was an unspoken dynamic in the battle between Mbeki and Zuma: Who in the ANC had gotten rich since the end of apartheid? And, perhaps more important, who had not?

Mandela and some others -- including South Africa's current president, Cyril Ramaphosa -- became wealthy, in part through connections to white business leaders.

The Guptas hired or became business partners with the sons of powerful ANC politicians, like Zuma's son Duduzane, and Tshepiso Magashule, the son of Ace Magashule, the party's current secretary-general.

It fell to the youngest of the Gupta brothers -- the friendly and easygoing Rajesh, nicknamed Tony -- to keep the sons happy. They went to nightclubs together and hung out in the family's compound in Johannesburg.

Tony also took the lead in pursuing business in Free State province, where corruption had flourished under Magashule, its leader at the time, ANC officials said.

In an interview, Mxolisi Dukwana, then Magashule's provincial minister of economic development, recalled how he and his boss went to visit Tony in Johannesburg. The president's son, Duduzane, was also there, he said.

Express Opinion Sabarimala: The past and present Out of My Mind: Bankrupt economicsBy Meghnad Desai

Tony asked Dukwana to endorse a large-scale development project in the province, promising him a monthly cut, Dukwana said.

Tony added that he and the other two men in the room had a similar arrangement in a mining project, Dukwana said. He recounted Tony's saying that he ""personally gave"" monthly payments of about $71,000 each to Magashule and to the president's son.

""Then he asked them, 'Have I ever failed you?' And they both said no,"" Dukwana said.

Ties at the Top

The Guptas also gained great influence over the president and his affairs. According to witnesses in the government inquiry into the Zuma years, the Guptas had a say in choosing ministers, or even offered positions to candidates directly.

Duduzane Zuma, the president's son, helped the Guptas expand beyond mining. They started a newspaper and a television news station, ANN7, that thrived on government advertising, which their political connections easily secured.

As in other projects, Duduzane Zuma was the Guptas' Black Economic Empowerment partner in the venture. But it was clear he was simply a proxy for the president, said Rajesh Sundaram, an Indian journalist who worked directly under Atul Gupta to start the channel.

In meetings that Sundaram attended with the Guptas and the president, Zuma was intimately engaged in the network's launch. Seeing how close the Guptas were with Zuma, Sundaram said he once asked Atul, ""What if Zuma goes?""

""'Well, we've got everyone in our pocket,'"" Atul replied, Sundaram recalled.

Ruinous Miscalculations

As the Gupta brothers prospered, they flaunted it. But two events -- both, as it turned out, related to planes -- contributed to their undoing.

In 2013, the brothers chartered a plane with about 200 guests from India to attend the extravagant wedding of a niece in Sun City, South Africa's Las Vegas. They invited relatives, friends, businessmen and politicians, mostly from India.

But the brothers miscalculated. Using their political connections, they landed the plane near Sun City -- at a military base. Its use by a private family set off a government inquiry, turning the Guptas into a favorite target of opposition politicians eager to expose corruption under Zuma.

Soon enough, the Guptas were embroiled in another drama, one that pitted them against the Oppenheimers, the family dynasty that had been South Africa's most powerful for a century.

The Oppenheimers had sold their shares in Anglo American and De Beers for billions. The heirs to the fortune -- Nicky Oppenheimer and his son Jonathan -- opened an ultraluxury private terminal in Johannesburg's main airport in 2014, with fine dining and a gallery with art for sale.

But the Oppenheimers couldn't get permission to handle international flights. Despite countless letters and calls to ANC officials, the Oppenheimers were getting nowhere. Eventually, they sued the government, accusing the Guptas of using their political influence to stall the business. The brothers, the Oppenheimers said, wanted in on the terminal.

According to court documents, the Guptas sent a message to the Oppenheimers that they had ""the wrong BEE partner"" -- referring to the Black Economic Empowerment program. If the Oppenheimers chose a partner endorsed by the Guptas, the documents said, their ""problems would go away.""

The last straw was another appointment: In late 2015, Zuma chose an unknown lawmaker -- considered close to the Guptas -- as finance minister. Alarmed, the business establishment and its ANC allies struck back, forcing Zuma to remove the minister after only four days.

Within weeks, a major South African bank cut ties with the Gupta family. The country's other big banks followed.

Last Flight Out

The Guptas were getting nervous. Their most powerful ally, Zuma, was scheduled to step down as the ANC's leader in late 2017. The brothers would soon find out whether they had eggs in more than one basket.

The race to succeed Zuma was tight. His former wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma appeared to have a slight edge over her rival, Ramaphosa, the favorite candidate of the business establishment.

The Gupta empire was getting squeezed. Locked out of banks, the brothers could not pay their employees or debts. Their only public company was delisted from the Johannesburg stock exchange. South African companies, big and small, refused to do business with them.

Cornered, they sold a mining company and their media empire in quick succession. Many of their remaining companies filed for bankruptcy protection and are now managed by outside supervisors.

Everything might have worked out for them had Zuma's ex-wife won. But one of her supporters, David Mabuza -- who had become a kingmaker by diverting government money to finance his political rise -- flipped his votes at the last minute, handing Ramaphosa a slim victory.

South Africans, predicting the end of the Guptas, began tracking the family's prized Bombardier Global 6000 jet as it travelled to Dubai, Russia, Switzerland and elsewhere.

On Feb. 4, the Guptas turned off the jet's GPS tracking device, according to Canada's export credit agency, which had lent the Guptas $41 million to buy the Bombardier. The agency sued to get the plane back, saying the Guptas might use it ""to escape justice.""

Ten days later -- on the day Zuma finally gave up and resigned as South Africa's president -- law enforcement officials raided the Gupta estate in Johannesburg.

When I was given charge of the police station, we formed a detailed policy under the guidance of Additional Commissioner (East region) and DCP (Zone 7) and began implementing it. The first step was to have dedicated teams to resolve issues. A list of serious crime offenders was prepared with over 150 names. They were chased and tracked down by our teams. We then revived four beat chowkis to resolve petty issues in residential areas. Rigorous patrolling was initiated, emphasising on foot patrolling which reinforced police presence in the area. Finally, we decided to keep a special tab on sensitive areas like schools, colleges, and the Tansa Pipeline which is a hub of criminals. The result of this tireless work of our teams is visible now.

Is there an evident reduction in the crime rate?

Certainly! If you check the records, there isn't a single murder case in the jurisdiction in the recent past. There were two incidents of attempt to murder but our thick network of informers helped us catch the culprits from the site of incident. Every complaint was addressed with seriousness and brought on record, which has comforted citizens. There hasn't been a single complaint of eve-teasing or ragging from schools or colleges in the last few months. With well-coordinated and enhanced police-citizens relations, we are being able to get instant information to avert crimes. Drug menace was quite pronounced in Bhandup with the Tansa pipeline being the big den of peddlers as well as revelers. It is on our target. We have formed a dedicated Anti-Narcotics team with a Police Sub Inspector in charge of it. Also, help from neighbouring police stations is sought during raids.

Are special measure being undertaken to curb crime?

Yes, we have prepared a list of seven habitual offenders involved in offences against human body (which can cause murder). They will be externed after following due process. Counselling is also on our mind but we haven't begun such awareness programmes yet. Four months is a small period to settle in a police station catering to a population of 12.8 lakh (according to 2011 census). But you can witness the real change in the near future."

The committee also approved another list of 197 illegal religious structures in Category B. These are meant to be demolished. A majority of these structures are situated on lands reserved for public amenities like gardens, schools etc. Parts of some of structures are on footpath.

A list of 1,204 structures was prepared by the NMC's 10 zones after a survey. NMC sources told TOI final fate of structures placed in Category B will be decided after the entire process. ""List of structures constructed in or before 1960 will require to be sent to the state-level committee for final decision,"" sources said.

At present, the process to confirm minutes of the meeting is going on. Members of the committee including commissioner of police BK Upadhyay, NIT chairman Ashwin Mudgal, representatives of state PWD, revenue department etc will sign the minutes.

Later, suggestions and objections will be invited on the list of Category A and B for a period of one month followed by hearing of those who will submit the objections.

The entire process including division of structures in categories is being done as per orders of Nagpur bench of Bombay High Court. The final list will be submitted to the HC. The number of illegal religious structures already demolished has reached 738. The civic body had razed over 400 structures on roads and footpaths. The NIT had demolished 338 such structures.

Meanwhile, NMC town planning department is finalizing a policy to regularize illegal religious structures constructed in open spaces and not obstructing traffic. After approval of general body, the department invited suggestions and objections on the proposed policy. Only three suggestions were received and all of them in favour of the policy.

The department will submit the policy with the state government for final approval. After clearance, NMC can regularize these structures by giving lease of the lands, sanctioning building plans etc."

How many people in Bengaluru use Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Company (BMTC) buses, which are perceived to be the lifeline of the city, everyday?

BMTC figures say the ridership is 51 lakh. This means BMTC, with its 6650 buses, sells 51 lakh tickets daily from the 70,892 trips it undertakes. Each bus undertakes an average of 5-6 round trips per day.

There are demands for increasing BMTC buses. But will more buses help? Look at the city's roads - the traffic crawls at such a low speed that even walking can help you reach the destination faster. BMTC buses are always stranded in traffic. Some buses are crowded, while others are empty.

BMTC is making profit of course, only by cutting off the routes that do not make profit. But sometimes, buses do not exist even on the routes that need them, and during the time band when most people travel.

The other day, I suddenly got nostalgic when I recalled how Bengaluru was in the year 2000 - the calm, cool era when Sampige Road had a lot of Sampige trees and Margosa Road had neem trees, where one could walk for hours on the well-maintained footpaths under the canopy of trees. The days when one just got into bus number 63 and sat peacefully for 40 minutes to reach Vijayanagar. Nobody could have predicted how things would change in just 18 years!

Recalling all this, as if in a dream, I walked from St Marks Road to Shivajinagar bus stand. The traffic and pollution didn't bother me because I was on a mission of walking down memory lane. I reached Shivajinagar and waited for bus number 63.

Even after waiting for 30 minutes, there was no sign of the bus. Finally I had to go for another bus that was headed towards Modi Hospital area. The time I spent from walking, waiting to finally reaching the destination was 2.5 hours. If I had used Metro I would have needed just 30 minutes. I realised that bus number 63 had become an endangered species, thanks to the Metro. Namma Metro's Purple line connects MG Road directly to Vijayanagar, but doesn't travel on the same roads as the bus, and doesn't have the same stops.

The buses that are headed to Laggere, R T Nagar, Sanjayanagar, Kaval Byrasandra, Jalahalli, Basaveshwaranagar etc from Shivajinagar still have passengers, while buses going to Peenya, K R Puram etc were almost empty. This could be because of the nature of connectivity these places have. This also tells us why BMTC is not the preferred mode of transport for many within the city and to those going to areas where there is some alternative connectivity like train or Metro.

When the status of BMTC buses within the city is like this, why would anyone prefer BMTC buses if they have another alternative, or can afford autos or cabs? Isn't it too ambitious to expect people to waste time on BMTC buses?

Interestingly, BMTC's 6600 buses are not the only buses operating in the city. There are 48,899 buses registered in Bengaluru, as per the data from Transport Department for November 2018, out of which 12,229 buses belong to educational institutions - that is, almost double the BMTC fleet! The rest of the buses are operated by private and corporate agencies.

These buses from educational institutions make two trips per day, to carry the students to school/college and drop them back. But there's more to it sometimes. Ever since BMTC trimmed the number of buses on routes that stop at Race Course Road, a bus from a reputed educational institution has been stopping in front of Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan every day at 6 pm sharp. The bus picks up regular passengers and goes towards Vijayanagar.

This bus is always full, though operating like this is ""illegal"". The punctuality of this bus has made it a reliable choice among commuters who wait for it. That the BMTC has not observed this is surprising. All they have to do is to bring back route number 63 during peak hours.

What would be the actual number of people using BMTC? Among the 51 lakh tickets sold by BMTC, there are passholders and regular travelers who change buses to reach their destinations. Each ticket they buy is considered in the ridership, and a person who needs two buses to go and come back ends up accounting for four tickets.

Lakhs of people would have used multiple buses to go to a destination that doesn't have a direct bus. These commuters would also have taken the Metro, if the bus is a feeder bus. Because of all these reasons, the actual number of people traveling using BMTC everyday could be probably closer to 22 lakh or less.

Same with Metro trains - when they say they sell 4.5 lakh tickets everyday, actual number of people who use Metro would be half of it or a little less - let us assume it is about 2.2 lakh.

Railways, within Bengaluru and suburban areas, make about 120 trips per day, and have a ridership of 1.5 lakh approximately. Divide it by two assuming that the number includes return trips, and the passenger figure stands at about 75,000 to 80,000.

This puts the number of people using public transport, that is buses, trains and Metro at a maximum of 25 lakh, in a city of 1.2 crore people.

According to the 2011 census, the working population in Bengaluru was 42,46,927 - 45.52 % of the total population. The population was then 96,21,551 in the city. Now this would have gone upto 55.2 lakh, assuming 46% of the people are working today - and we have 1.2 crore people. We can safely assume that at least 50 lakh among the working population in Bengaluru need regular commute/travel options.

Add to these the students from the age of 4 to 20, who also need transport to get to their schools and colleges. What would be their number?

Census 2011 data says that 26.16% of the population in urban areas is currently between the age of 5 and 19. If we assume this population has either school-going, college-going or working people, all of them need to move from one place to another. 26.16% of 1.2 crores is roughly 31 lakh. This is the maximum number of youngsters and teens in 2018. Even if 10% of this is ignored, to account for various reasons, the young population that needs transport facilities could be 27 lakh.

To actually see and visualise the population that might need to travel, look at the data below for age-wise population taken from the Draft Revised Master Plan-2031. The percentage of people in the age group between 5 and 60 that mostly need to travel, excluding a good percentage of women between 25 to 60 who choose to stay home, is huge, and will continue to be huge.

So, here is a population of 77 lakh that needs to travel everyday, and we have roughly 25 lakh people using public transport; two-thirds of the population, that's about 52 lakh people, still depend upon private transport, shared cabs and taxis to commute.

The Draft Revised Master Plan -2031 has estimated that total estimated population willing to work including men and women in 2021 is 58,34,179 - 46.575% of the population eligible to work. This number goes up to 50% of the eligible population - 93,79,352 in 2031. These people need reliable transport to travel.

These numbers further indicate that Bengaluru's future transport needs will be huge, unless more people shift to work-from-home kind of jobs.

How many private vehicles are added to Bengaluru's traffic each month? Private vehicle data for October and November 2018 looks like this:

This data does not include vehicles that met with accident, or were taken to other states by people who move out, or the out-of-state vehicles in Bengaluru not re-registered, so the actual number of vehicles that are on the road could be less. However, even if 1/3 of the 78,49,740 vehicles are not on road everyday, the number of vehicles on the road is still huge.

Now what happens if the city adds more BMTC buses to this melee, without planning in advance? It will end up being a drop in the ocean, due to the rise in private vehicles, competition for road space and lack of robust road infrastructure. Lack of trust among needy passengers regarding the timeliness is just a by-product.

One cannot stress enough on the need for better public mass rapid transport in this city that's growing everyday. As calculated earlier, the existing mass public transport systems serve only 1/3 of the needy population at best. 2/3 of the population currently needs private transport, and it is hard to change it without credible alternatives.

And here is the city, struggling to meet the demand with more buses and more elevated roads, while delaying Metro tenders, light rail systems, commuter rails and rapid transport projects. The city needs a lot more trains, metro trains and more metro routes which carry more people at good speed, while buses and autos must complement these mass rapid systems instead of competing with them.

Planning the city's transport without taking all these facts into account, and without creating credible long-term public transport infrastructure for 75 lakh people in the city, is going to only add more private vehicles to the roads, and will cost the city a lot in the long run."

Amit had been with Video Volunteers (VV) since 2012 and reported for Newscode and OK Times and sometimes also drove a taxi for Ola Cabs.

Amit Topno was shot dead on 9 December in Ranchi.

Amit reported fearlessly on issues like sand mining, illegal alcohol sales, adivasi rights, education, sanitation, human trafficking, land rights, culture and most recently the Pathalgadi movement. His last report for VV was produced six months ago on the Pathalgadi, a movement in which adivasi communities across Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh asserted their right to self-governance. The movement has its roots in creating awareness and ensuring implementation of the key provisions of the Panchayats (Extensions Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 that empower a village as an administrative unit.

Like many of VV correspondents, besides being a community journalist, Amit was a social activist too. He followed up his video reports with on ground action to solve the problem he was reporting. He held community screenings, conducted village meetings, assisted the community in writing applications and approaching government officials and worked towards ensuring accountability. His efforts solved 45 percent of the problems he reported on. It made schools safer and encouraged the administration to deal with issues like the human-animal conflict in the area.

Those who knew Amit remember him as an inquisitive, warm, fun loving and an extremely helpful and courageous individual. ""Jharkhand is a land caught up in a frightful storm. Its people are being whirled around in a storm of starvation, conflict and poverty. I am the headman of my village, Nichitpur, Jharkhand, and I'm tired of seeing my people die,"" Amit had said in an interview in 2014.

Amit's body was found on the Namkum-Doranda road in Ranchi on 9 December. The autopsy report reveals that he was shot in the head and the bullet was still lodged in. The nature of the injury revealed that he was shot at close range. The autopsy report also stated that there were no signs of struggle or scuffle, not even a scratch. His taxi, phone and identity cards were missing but not the money. '

All of this, points to a pre-meditated and professionally-executed murder. It has been over 11 days since his murder, but no arrests have been made in the case yet, even though the police have said that they are closing on some leads.

On 14 December, more than a 100 people, including social movement leaders, activists, journalists, students and members of the VV network participated in a silent candlelight march to protest his murder. At the march, Jerrome Kujur, Dayamani Barla, Deepak Bara spoke out about the frequent threats and harassment of activists and journalists in Jharkhand. They urged the state to conduct a thorough investigation into this case and bring Amit's murderers to justice.

On 15 December, 2018, a delegation of civil society organisations, including VV, met with the superintendent of police and urged him to conduct a thorough and speedy investigation into Amit's murder. The SP assured that all possible angles will be investigated.

On 17 December, 2018, the Jharkhand Jantantrik Mahasabha organised a peaceful protest in Jamshedpur. Friends and allies of Amit also submitted an application to the National Scheduled Tribe Commission urging them to take note of the gruesome murder. Civil society organisations appraised this matter to the Chief Secretary of Jharkhand government and other ministers on 19 December 2018. Arup Chatterjee, an MLA from Nirsa Dhanbad, was handed over documents related to Amit's work and he has promised to raise the issue in the upcoming winter session of the assembly starting on 24th December.

Though Amit had not informed his network of any threat or danger to him in the last 18 months, it cannot be ruled out that he was murdered because of his work as a journalist and social activist, raising issues affecting communities on the margins and working in an area, where conflict over land, resources is rife. In November 2018, another journalist from the same area was murdered. At a time when India ranks 14th on the Global Impunity Index, Amit's murder is a reminder that journalists who speak to truth to power and report out of remote, rural areas are not safe.

After 15 years of repression, misrule and loot of Chhattisgarh's natural resources, the defeat of Raman Singh's BJP government offers a historic opportunity for the state. In voting so decisively for the Congress, the people have not just unseated an incumbent, but signalled the kind of change they want.

Some of these aspirations are presaged in the Congress's manifesto, prepared, we are told, after extensive consultations with different sections of society.Apart from the farm loan waiver, increased minimum support prices and unemployment allowance, an emphasis on quality healthcare and education seem to be priorities for people, and the Congress would be wise to treat these as its priorities too.

But where the Congress has the chance to be really transformative is in how it addresses the Naxalite conflict. This is Rahul Gandhi's litmus test to show if he and his party care about India's adivasis.

If the Congress initiates talks with the Maoists, as they say in point 22 of their manifesto, they will have the full support of the people of Bastar. Far from ""teaching Congress a lesson for supporting urban Maoists"", as Modi repeatedly said on the campaign trail, the people of the region have given the Congress 11 out of 12 seats. There are indications in this win - for instance, the fact that they allowed Congress candidates to campaign in interior villages - that the Maoists too are ready for some kind of talks. They would be colossally foolish to give up an opportunity for a negotiated peace.

But equally important, a foundation must be built for such talks to succeed, and this can only be built on the basis of justice. 'Development' is no substitute for justice; both are rights but in different spheres and cannot be traded off against each other.

It is perhaps divine providence that the Delhi high court judgment on Sajjan Kumar came on the same day as the swearing in of the new Congress governments. Even though the party failed the test of justice in Madhya Pradesh by appointing Kamal Nath as chief minister, it has a chance in Chhattisgarh to redress its own historic wrongs.

Mahendra Karma, the Congress leader who was the local face of the BJP-backed Salwa Judum movement is no longer around to haunt the Congress. But the legacy of entire villages burnt, rape survivors, and children whose parents were brutally killed under the banner of Salwa Judum will continue to dog the footsteps of both the Congress and the BJP.

In a country where violence piles up on violence and every part of the country is torn and bleeding due to its own history of pogroms and massacres, it is easy to forget. Let me therefore quote from just one fact-finding report of December 2007, by Shanta Sinha, then the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, J.M. Lyngdoh (former CEC) and Venkat Reddy:

The public hearing was held in Charla and was attended by more than 200 IDP: men, women and children. The team heard the testimonies of over 35 people. Every testimony included a narrative of extreme violence committed against them, their families and property, by the Naxalites, Salwa Judum and the security forces. Many people shared accounts of family members being killed and women raped by the Salwa Judum. Having faced repeated acts of violence, harassment, arson and pillage the only option for these people was to run away from their villages and seek refuge in another state....Leaving behind their land and livestock they have arrived in Andhra Pradesh in a state of penury and distress.

The current deputy speaker of the Rajya Sabha, Harivansh, then editor of Prabhat Khabar, was a member of another fact-finding report on Bastar, War in the Heart of India, by the Independent Citizens Initiative, which found armed minor SPOs on the prowl, people forced into camps and complete lawlessness.

There has been no shortage of ground reports, media accounts and testimonies submitted to courts at all levels as well as institutions like the NHRC in the past 13 years which indicate human rights violations on a large scale, including mass gang rapes and the killing of unarmed civilian children. Unlike Delhi 1984 and Gujarat 2002, however, these atrocities have lasted for years over a vast area. As recently as September 2018, on a visit to Konta, I found the security forces were still raiding villages, destroying goods and killing individuals randomly on suspicion of being Maoists. Unlike 1984 and 2002, the violence has also not been one-sided: the only political strategy the Maoists appear to know is 'counter violence', whether against security forces or suspected (civilian) informers.

It is not as if the courts have not responded to these pleas - in its 2011 judgment the Supreme Court, apart from directing that SPOs be disbanded and disarmed, also directed the prosecution of all those guilty of human rights violations and compensation to all those affected. The tragedy, however, is that the government of Chhattisgarh wilfully flouted all these directions. A case for contempt has been pending in the Supreme Court since 2012.

In its manifesto, the Congress has promised to raise the prices of forest produce, to implement the Forest Rights Act 2006 and the Land Acquisition and Rehabilitation Act (LARR) 2013. All of these are extremely important, and can make a difference to people outside the zone of immediate conflict as well as to lives ravaged by violence and illegal mining.

The Congress has also promised to give each 'Naxal affected panchayat' Rs 10 million, However, money to panchayats will not solve the problem - the brute reality is that in the worst ""Maoist affected Panchayats"", it is the Maoists and not the government who decide whether panchayat funds can be spent.

The Maoist complaint is that the money is spent on paper only, through collusion between district officials and sarpanches who live in Salwa Judum camps. They also argue that the excessive inflow of funds corrupts people, and have implemented a model of self-reliance in their areas, where people work on each other's fields and build ponds collectively.

""The people"", however, want panchayat funds so that they can develop their own villages instead of migrating as coolie labour to Andhra, but in these regions also trust the Maoists more than the government to protect their land and their lives. Villagers want schools and they want health facilities. The government has been saying that teachers can't go back to the villages without security, but the people don't see these as connected - for them it is security camps, which are the greatest source of insecurity.

The only basis on which this complicated narrative can be slowly changed is if the government makes justice its first priority. Fortunately, there are many examples around the world where such long running counter-insurgencies have been addressed - like Peru's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, or Guatemala's Commission for Historical Clarification. Closer home, we have already submitted a Rehabilitation Plan to the Supreme Court, which outlines certain procedures. These include a survey of all conflict affected villages in Bastar to map the loss of lives and property; announcement of compensation; fast-track courts to release all those falsely accused in Naxalite cases; and restoration of essential services like schools, anganwadis, public distribution system etc.

For over a decade we have been pleading for an independent monitoring committee or at least a joint committee to oversee this rehabilitative exercise, in which all sides can work together instead of being adversarial.

Unlike its predecessor regime which believed that the way to fight legal battles where the evidence is clearly against you is to imprison your opponents on scurrilously false charges, the new government has a chance to act honourably. It should throw open the state to journalists, researchers, lawyers and activists - who have in the past been threatened, forced out, and vilified, and withdraw all false cases against them. Bastar can no longer be the fiefdom of megalomaniac police officers who threaten to stone human rights activists or run over them in SUVs. To be sure, prosecution of those responsible for human rights violations will be difficult with MLAs like Salwa Judum leader Vikram Mandavi of Bijapur, but not insurmountable.

The Jeeram Ghati incident in which much of the Congress leadership was killed, and in which some Congress quarters suspect BJP complicity, should indeed be investigated. But the government must move beyond justice for the Congress to justice for the people it represents. There is so much work to be done - and so many exciting new beginnings that are possible."

Acting Attorney General Whitaker made the following statement:

""President Donald Trump is a law and order president, who has signed into law millions of dollars in funding for law enforcement officers in our schools, and under his strong leadership, the Department of Justice has prosecuted more gun criminals than ever before as we target violent criminals.

The final rule amends the regulatory text by adding the following language: ""The term 'machine gun' includes bump-stock devices, i.e., devices that allow a semiautomatic firearm to shoot more than one shot with a single pull of the trigger by harnessing the recoil energy of the semi-automatic firearm to which it is affixed so that the trigger resets and continues firing without additional physical manipulation of the trigger by the shooter."" Furthermore, the final rule defines ""automatically"" and ""single function of the trigger"" as those terms are used in the statutory definition of machinegun. Specifically,

Because the final rule clarifies that bump-stock-type devices are machineguns, the devices fall within the purview of the NFA and are subject to the restrictions of 18 U.S.C. 922(o). As a result, persons in possession of bump-stock-type devices must divest themselves of the devices before the effective date of the final rule. A current possessor may destroy the device or abandon it at the nearest ATF office, but no compensation will be provided for the device. Any method of destruction must render the device incapable of being readily restored to its intended function.

The final rule may be found here.

Information and instructions for destruction of the devices will be posted on ATF's website later today.

Please note: This is the text of the final rule as signed by the Acting Attorney General, but the official version of the final rule will be as it is published in the Federal Register."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on US college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the US Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said _ barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees _ or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there _ are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Detention camps in Xinjiang

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the US, and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear _ jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more _ from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to US customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The US and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the US.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the US, Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the US that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith. ""US consumers should not be buying and US businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

Stringent state security under President Xi Jinping

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the US

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Pronouncing its verdict, the court held that absence of a Delhi address proof is not a valid ground to deny admission to children into the city's schools.

Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, a government school in Anand Vihar in Delhi had reportedly denied admission to kids who could not produce their permanent residence proof of the national capital.

However, Justice C Hari Sankar on Tuesday (18 December) has directed the school to grant admission to the three children who live in Ghaziabad.

The father of the three children had approached the High Court pleading that the school denied admission to his kids on the ground that they did not have a residence proof of Delhi.

The petition further stated that refusal of admissions is ""arbitrary, discriminatory, illegal, unconstitutional, and violative of fundamental rights"".

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labor from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centers, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

They say that people in the centers have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

A child stands near a large screen showing photos of Xi Jinping in Kashgar, western China's Xinjiang region.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centers, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before.

The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang.

""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained.

The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

Buildings are seen around the Kunshan Industrial Park in Artux.

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign.

They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training center collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility.""

Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up.

But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labor and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labor.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labor.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years.

He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments.

The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labor is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labor in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there.

But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labor.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump administration on Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labor,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not be importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping.

Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Orynbek Koksebek, a former detainee in a Chinese internment camp.

Not all the camps have forced labor. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp.

Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labor in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centers. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labor program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks.

Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A police station is seen inside the Artux City Vocational Skills Education Training Service Center.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls.

The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training.""

The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labor contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual laborers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp.

He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

Concrete chunks can be seen falling off the ceiling, with cracks running across the walls, at GSSS Islampur. The building has 15 rooms with 550 students in classes VI-XI. Washrooms were stinking, there were no faucets and urinals were broken. The school principal accept the condition of the school's infrastructure is not good. ""A proposal to rebuild the school building has been placed before the authorities. This building will be brought down soon.

""The Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyala is at a distance of 2-3 km from their residence and there is no justification not to grant admission to wards of my client merely on the ground that they are not residents of Delhi... In case they were not allowed to attend classes... in any other government school nearby in the academic year 2018-19, their studies would suffer badly,"" the petition said."

Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside.

Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams.

This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region, where by some estimates 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination. Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina. The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S. Badger CEO John Anton said Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang. They say that people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training.

The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories. Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retrained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang. A person with firsthand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 per cent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his monthlong detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational centre, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating to ancient traders on the Silk Road. In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls. Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training centre"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemies of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training centre featured in the China Central Television report. Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the centre is government-operated.

""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.

Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collaborated with companies to give trainees practical experience. Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller. The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory. In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements. Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College. However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour.

All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China. Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts.

""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan. But in April this year, it began importing 100 per cent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.

It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia. The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uyghurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, but they are also now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith. ""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases. The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories. The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push. A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes.

A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing. Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest and did not need a poverty alleviation program. Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city centre.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.

""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away. They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign.

If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday. Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

There are 174 illegal private schools operational in villages without requisite approvals for the buildings, officials of education department in Gautam Budh Nagar district said.

The Uttar Pradesh government on April 23, 1976, had established the New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) and, according to the Master Plan 2021, the city is spread across 2,031 hectares, comprising 81 villages and 168 Sectors including residential, commercial and Industrial uses.

The Noida authority has the mandate to regulate buildings of all kinds, including schools, in urban and rural areas. It has the power to issue notices and seal illegal and unsafe buildings.

After the twin building collapse in Greater Noida's Shahberi, in July 2018, killed nine persons, the Noida authority had conducted a survey and identified illegal buildings in all villages.

On August 3, the Noida authority had identified 1,757 buildings, which were constructed without approvals.

""However, we did not count unsafe buildings, which are being used for schools in villages. The administration and education department should look into this issue,"" a Noida authority official, not authorised to speak to media, said.

Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon and additional chief executive officer RK Mishra were unavailable for comment on the issue despite repeated attempts to reach them. The authority' officer on special duty, RK Singh, refused comment on the issue.

Over 70 of 174 illegal schools are operational in Noida villages, officials of education department said.

""We had acted against illegal schools in 2017 and over 85 were shut down then. We are taking necessary action in this regard and schools, which are illegal, will face tough legal action,"" BN Singh, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.

Officials of the district administration may also write to the Noida authority as to why it did not act against owners of buildings, where illegal schools are operational.

These illegal schools cater to over 1 lakh students. They do not have affiliations to the Uttar Pradesh state education board, the Central Board of Secondary Education or any other board. These schools mostly cater to the children of factory workers and daily age earners, who cannot afford to send their children to recognised private schools.

""Each school, on an average, accommodates over 1,000 students and the fee is in the range of ₹800 to ₹1,500 a month. All these schools are sheltered by the education department. These school buildings do not have any safety measure in place. Some schools have over 1,000 students studying in small and dinghy buildings that have no setback area or fire safety systems in place,"" a school teacher, requesting anonymity, said."

They were not even provided with an ambulance to carry the body from the mortuary to their home on Monday. Tired of waiting, the family hired a tempo to carry the body back home to Salarpur village.

Dinesh Yadav, Vivek's father, was angry with the administration for allowing illegal schools to function in the district. ""I have no hope that the officials will do something; they couldn't even provide us an ambulance to carry the body of our son. Police at the mortuary told us to manage by ourselves and refused to arrange an ambulance. I have lost my youngest son for no fault of his. We want the culprits to be punished and a monetary compensation to take care of my other children,"" Yadav, who owns a tailoring business in Salarpur, said.

Vivek's mother was in a state of shock after the incident and was inconsolable. ""I had three children (two boys and a girl) and the youngest one is no more. Vivek was a very chirpy child and he loved studying. I still can't believe that he won't be coming back home ever,"" Sheila, his mother, said.

Dev Singh, father of Bhupendra, the second child who was killed in the wall collapse, had no knowledge that the school was running illegally. ""We are poor people and sending our children to schools itself is a big thing for us. I did not know that the school was illegal. It is the responsibility of the administration to ensure the safety of students. Whatever they do now, I have lost my son,"" Singh, a vegetable seller, said.

The disheartened parents and their family members blocked the Dadri Main Road and raised slogans against the administration. Vivek's body, covered in a white cloth, was kept on the road. Police had to reach the spot and pacify protesters.

""The administration has decided to provide a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the family of Vivek and Bhupendra. We will be making arrests in the matter soon,"" Shwetabh Pandey, circle officer 3, said."

(AP) Barbed wire and hundreds of cameras ring a massive compound of more than 30 dormitories, schools, warehouses and workshops in China's far west. Dozens of armed officers and a growling Doberman stand guard outside. Behind locked gates, men and women are sewing sportswear that can end up on U.S. college campuses and sports teams. This is one of a growing number of internment camps in the Xinjiang region where, by some estimates, 1 million Muslims are detained, forced to give up their language and their religion and subject to political indoctrination.

Now, the Chinese government is also forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. Some of them are within the internment camps; others are privately-owned, state-subsidized factories where detainees are sent once they are released.

The Associated Press has tracked recent, ongoing shipments from one such factory inside an internment camp to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

The shipments show how difficult it is to stop products made with forced labour from getting into the global supply chain, even though such imports are illegal in the U.S., Badger CEO John Anton said on Sunday that the company would source sportswear elsewhere while it investigates.

Chinese authorities say the camps, which they call training centres, offer free vocational training for Uighurs, Kazakhs and others, mostly Muslims, as part of a plan to bring minorities into ""a modern civilized"" world and eliminate poverty in Xinjiang.

According to them, people in the centres have signed agreements to receive vocational training. The Xinjiang Propaganda Department did not respond to a faxed request for comment.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman accused the foreign media on Monday of making ""many untrue reports"" about the training centres, but did not specify when asked for details.

""Those reports are completely based on hearsay evidence or made out of thin air,"" the spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a daily briefing.

However, a dozen people who either had been in a camp or had friends or family in one told the AP that detainees they knew were given no choice but to work at the factories.

Most of the Uighurs and Kazakhs, who were interviewed in exile, also said that even people with professional jobs were retained to do menial work.

Payment varied according to the factory. Some got paid nothing, while others earned up to several hundred dollars a month, they said -- barely above minimum wage for the poorer parts of Xinjiang.

A person with first-hand knowledge of the situation in one county estimated that more than 10,000 detainees -- or 10 to 20 percent of the internment population there -- are working in factories, with some earning just a tenth of what they used to earn before. The person declined to be named out of fear of retribution.

A former reporter for Xinjiang TV in exile said that during his month long detention last year, young people in his camp were taken away in the mornings to work without compensation in carpentry and a cement factory.

""The camp didn't pay any money, not a single cent,"" he said, asking to be identified only by his first name, Elyar, because he has relatives still in Xinjiang. ""Even for necessities, such as things to shower with or sleep at night, they would call our families outside to get them to pay for it.""

Rushan Abbas, a Uighur in Washington, D.C., said her sister is among those detained. The sister, Dr. Gulshan Abbas, was taken to what the government calls a vocational center, although she has no specific information on whether her sister is being forced to work.

""American companies importing from those places should know those products are made by people being treated like slaves,"" she said. ""What are they going to do, train a doctor to be a seamstress?""

The predominantly Muslim Uighur and Kazakh ethnic minorities in China live mostly in the Xinjiang region bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan, with a legacy dating back to ancient traders on the Silk Road.

In recent decades, violent attacks by Uighur militants have killed hundreds and prompted the Chinese government to blanket Xinjiang with stifling security.

About two years ago, authorities launched a vast detention and re-education campaign. They also use checkpoints, GPS tracking and face-scanning cameras for surveillance of ethnic minorities in the region. The slightest perceived misstep can land someone in the internment camps.

Men and women in the complex that has shipped products to Badger Sportswear make clothes for privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel in a cluster of 10 workshops within the compound walls.

Hetian Taida says it is not affiliated with the internment camps, but its workforce includes detainees.

As China faced growing international pressure about the detention camps, its state broadcaster aired a 15-minute report in October that featured a ""vocational skills education and training center"" in the southern Xinjiang city of Hotan.

""Terrorism and extremism are the common enemy of human civilization,"" the China Central Television program began. In response, the report said, the Xinjiang government was using vocational training to solve this ""global issue.""

Wu Hongbo, the chairman of Hetian Taida, confirmed that the company has a factory inside the same compound as the training center featured in the China Central Television report.

Hetian Taida provides employment to those trainees who were deemed by the government to be ""unproblematic,"" he said, adding that the center is government-operated.""We're making our contribution to eradicating poverty,"" Wu told the AP over the phone.

The 20 to 30 trainees at the factory are treated like regular employees and make up a small fraction of the hundreds of people in its workforce, he said.Trainees featured in the state television report praised the Communist Party for saving them from a criminal path.

""I don't dare to imagine what would have happened to me if I didn't come here,"" one Uighur student said. ""The party and government found me in time and saved me. They gave me a chance to reinvent myself.""

The segment said that in addition to law and Mandarin-language classes, the training centre collabourated with companies to give trainees practical experience.

Trainees were shown hunched over sewing machines in a factory whose interior matches that of Hetian Taida's main Hotan branch, as seen in prior Chinese media reports.

Police told the AP journalists who approached the compound earlier this month that they could not take photos or film in the area because it was part of a ""military facility."" Yet the entrance was marked only by a tall gate that said it was an ""apparel employment training base.""

Posters line the barbed-wire perimeter, bearing messages such as ""Learn to be grateful, learn to be an upright person"" and ""No need to pay tuition, find a job easily.""

Nathan Ruser, a cyber-policy researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), analyzed satellite images for the AP and found that in Hetian Taida's case, the apparel factory and the government-run training camp are connected by a fenced path.

""There are watchtowers throughout,"" Ruser said. ""There are clear fences between the buildings and walls that limit movement. Detainees can only access the factories area through walkways, and the entire facility is closed.""

The AP could not independently determine if any workers were allowed to come and go, or how much if anything they were paid.

At least 10 times this year shipping containers filled with thousands of men's, women's and youth polyester knitted T-shirts and pants were sent to Badger Sportswear, a 47-year-old athletic gear seller.

The company mostly manufactures in Nicaragua and the U.S., and there is no way to tell where the products from Xinjiang specifically end up. But experts say supply chains are considered tainted by forced labour and modern slavery if even one item was produced by someone forced to work.

Sprinkled on the internet are clues that repeatedly tie the company to the detention camp's sewing factory floor.

Shawn Zhang, a researcher at the University of British Columbia, noted an overlooked Hotan city social media post from February about the first batch of some 1.5 million pieces of clothing worth $400,000 heading overseas from the Hetian Taida Factory.

In the middle of a photo of young women flashing the peace sign is Badger Sportswear's marketing director Ginny Gasswint, who is quoted as saying she's surprised the workers are ""friendly, beautiful, enthusiastic and hardworking.""

Badger Sportswear goes to university bookstores and sports teams large and small around the country, places like Charlotte Country Day School squash team in Charlotte, North Carolina, Rhode Island's Coventry Little League and Hansberry College Prep in Chicago, according to its website and advertisements.

Dozens of college bookstores advertise their gear printed on Badger Sportswear, including Texas A&M, University of Pennsylvania, Appalachian State University, University of Northern Iowa, University of Evansville and Bates College.

However, it's impossible to say if any particular shirt is made with forced labour. All the teams and schools that responded to the AP condemned forced labour.

Badger chief executive Anton said on Sunday that his company has sourced products from an affiliate of Hetian Taida for many years. He said about a year ago, the affiliate opened a new factory in western China.

Anton confirmed Badger Sportswear officials visited the factory and have a certificate that the factory is certified by social compliance experts. ""We will voluntarily halt sourcing and will move production elsewhere while we investigate the matters raised,"" he said.

Badger Sportswear was acquired by New York investment firm CCMP Capital Advisor in August 2016. Since then, CCMP has acquired three more team sportswear companies, which they are managing under the umbrella of Founder Sport Group.

In recent years, Badger imported sportswear -- jerseys, T-shirts, workout pants and more -- from Nicaragua and Pakistan.

But in April this year, it began importing 100 percent polyester T-shirts and pants from Hetian Taida Apparel, according to U.S. customs data provided by ImportGenius, which analyzes consumer shipments. The address on the shipping records is the same as for the detention camp.

The U.S. and United Nations say forced labour is a type of modern slavery, and that items made by people being exploited and coerced to work are banned from import to the U.S.It's unclear whether other companies also export products made by forced labour in Xinjiang to the U.S., Europe and Asia.

The AP found two companies exporting to the U.S. that share approximately the same coordinates as places experts have identified as internment camps, and Chinese media reports mention ""training"" there. But the AP could not confirm whether the companies use forced labour.

New Jersey Republican Congressman Chris Smith, a member of the House Foreign Relations Committee, called on the Trump Administration Monday to ban imports from Chinese companies associated with detention camps.

""Not only is the Chinese government detaining over a million Uighurs and other Muslims, forcing them to revoke their faith and profess loyalty to the Communist Party, they are now profiting from their labour,"" said Smith.

""U.S. consumers should not be buying and U.S. businesses should not importing goods made in modern-day concentration camps.""

The detention camp system is part of China's increasingly stringent state security under President Xi Jinping. Some detainees told AP earlier this year about beating, solitary confinement and other punishments if they do not recite political songs, names and phrases.

The AP has not been given access to these facilities despite repeated attempts to get permission to visit.

Not all the camps have forced labour. Many former detainees say they were held in facilities that didn't have any manufacturing equipment and focused solely on political indoctrination.

""They didn't teach me anything. They were brainwashing me, trying to make us believe how great China is, how powerful it is, how developed its economy is,"" said Kairat Samarkan, a Kazakh citizen who said he was tortured with a metal contraption that contorts your body before being released in February after he tried to kill himself.

Interviewees described a wave of factory openings earlier this year. Ex-detainee Orynbek Koksebek said that shortly before his release in April, the director strode into his class and announced that a factory would be built in the camp. Koksebek, who cannot speak Mandarin, listened to a policeman as he translated the director's words into Kazakh for the roughly 90 women and 15 men in the room.

""We're going to open a factory, you're going to work,"" Koksebek recalled him as saying. ""We'll teach you how to cook, how to sew clothes, how to fix cars.""

This fall, months after Koksebek's release, news began trickling into Kazakhstan that the Chinese government was starting forced labour in internment camps and would transfer some detainees out into gated, guarded factories.

The workers must live in dormitories on factory grounds. Contact with family ranges from phone calls or in-person visits, to weekends at home under police surveillance.

In October, Chinese authorities acknowledged the existence of what they called vocational training centres. State media published an interview with Shohret Zahir, the governor of Xinjiang, saying that ""some trainees"" were nearly done with their ""courses.""

""We will try to achieve a seamless connection between school teaching and social employment, so that after finishing their courses, the trainees will be able to find jobs and earn a well-off life,"" Zahir said.

The forced labour program goes along with a massive government initiative to develop Xinjiang's economy by constructing enormous factory parks. Another internment camp the AP visited was inside a factory compound called Kunshan Industrial Park, opened under the national anti-poverty push.

A local propaganda official, Chen Fang, said workers inside made food and clothes. A hospital, a police station, smokestacks, dormitories and a building with a sign that read ""House of Workers"" could be seen from outside the surrounding barbed wire fencing.

Another section resembled a prison, with guard towers and high walls. The AP did not track any exports from Kunshan to the U.S.

Many of those with relatives in such camps said their loved ones were well-educated with high-paying jobs before their arrest, and did not need a poverty alleviation program.

Nurbakyt Kaliaskar, a sheepherder's wife in Kazakhstan, said her daughter, Rezila Nulale, 25, was a college graduate with a well-paid advertising job in Urumqi, the capital of Xinjiang, where she lived a typical urban lifestyle with a computer, a washing machine and an apartment in the city center.

Then last August, after returning from a visit to her family across the border in Kazakhstan, Nulale vanished. She didn't answer phone calls and stopped showing up to work.

Four months later a stranger contacted Kaliaskar online and confirmed her fear: her daughter had been detained for ""political training."" The next spring, she said she fainted when two cases of her daughter's clothes were delivered to her home in Kazakhstan.

Last month, Kaliaskar got word via a friend who knows the family that Nulale was working in a factory next to the camp where she had been detained. The friend had heard from Kaliaskar's brother, who had visited Nulale, bringing medicine for an injured hand.

Kaliaskar learned her daughter wasn't being paid and had to meet a daily quota of three articles of clothing. She couldn't leave. Her uncle thought she looked pale and thin.""They say they're teaching her to weave clothes. But the thing is, she's well educated and had a job,"" said Kaliaskar. ""What's the point of this training?""

A former detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect himself and his family members, said other detainees from his camp also had been forced into jobs at factories far away.

They were taken to a government office and handed labour contracts for six months to five years in a distant factory, which they were required to sign. If they ran from the factories, they were warned, they'd be taken straight back to the camps for ""further education.""

Farmers, herders and manual labourers with little Mandarin and no higher education say they appreciated Beijing's past initiatives to help the poor, including subsidized housing and the installation of electricity and running water. But the camps, the forced education, and the factories, they say, go too far.

""I never asked the government to find work for my husband,"" said Mainur Medetbek, whose husband did odd repair jobs before vanishing into a camp in February during a visit to China from their home in Kazakhstan.

She has been able to glean a sense of his conditions from monitored exchanges with relatives and from the husband of a woman who is in the same camp. He works in an apparel factory and is allowed to leave and spend the night with relatives every other Saturday.

Though she's not certain how much her husband makes, the woman in his camp earns 600 yuan (about $87) a month, less than half the local minimum wage and far less than what Medetbek's husband used to earn.

Since her husband was detained, Medetbek and her children have had no reliable source of income and sometimes go hungry. The ordeal has driven her to occasionally contemplate suicide.

""They say it's a factory, but it's an excuse for detention. They don't have freedom, there's no time for him to talk with me,"" she said. ""They say they found a job for him. I think it's a concentration camp."""

Archery Equipment Market Revenue to Shoot Through the Roof Owing to Rising Adoption Among Children and Women

Over the years, archery has become one of the most played sports and has also found place in several international gaming events such as the Olympics. Archery as a sport has been found to develop certain mental abilities in children, making this one of the favorite sports activities that children can engage in. This factor is expected to boost the demand for various types of archery equipment, thereby increasing sales revenue in the archery equipment market. The last few years have witnessed a steadily increasing participation of women in the sport of archery. Women are taking part in large numbers in international archery competitions, thereby leading to a surge in demand and adoption of archery equipment.

The governments of several countries are encouraging archery as a sport and are implementing programs that help increase public participation in archery. This is further augmenting the demand for archery equipment, hence leading to a surge in revenue in the archery equipment market. Owing to the increasing popularity of archery across certain states in the U.S, schools are considering including archery as an integral part of school sports. This will boost the demand for archery equipment such as bows, arrows, targets, and related accessories and support equipment.

Archery Equipment Market Revenue Growth Inhibited by the Emergence of Counterfeit Products

With archery fast becoming a mainstream sport across the world, competition in the archery equipment market is intensifying by the day. To meet the steadily growing demand for archery equipment across various geographies, companies operating in the archery equipment market are introducing locally manufactured products at multiple price ranges to attract more number of customers. Some of the market players are even copying branded products to boost their sales and market share. Further, several 'direct from the factory' deals are being offered to lure customers, and these deals are mostly on counterfeit archery equipment. This kind of archery equipment is made from low quality raw materials that makes it possible to optimize the price points of such archery equipment. Proliferation of counterfeit archery equipment in the regional markets is anticipated to hamper revenue growth of the archery equipment market in the near future.

Moreover, hunting is deemed an illegal activity in several parts of the world. This is decreasing the participation of people in hunting activities for fear of violating the relevant international laws. This is bound to reduce the demand for archery equipment, thereby impacting growth in revenue of the archery equipment market in the long run.

Immense Opportunities Exist for Manufacturers in the Archery Equipment Market; Mass Merchants and Box Stores Primarily Responsible in Creating Lucrative Growth Prospects

Distributors and dealers in the archery equipment market consider box stores and mass merchants as direct competition. However, these are lucrative sales channels in the market for archery equipment and have the potential to introduce different varieties of archery equipment in the international market. Mass merchants and box stores will continue to remain leading channels for sales of archery equipment and provide lucrative growth opportunities for both established manufacturers as well as new entrants in the archery equipment market.

Media has a major role to play in inducing public participation in archery as a recreational hobby and fitness sport. Several movies and television shows showcasing archery as a great sport are motivating people to take up training in archery, thereby increasing memberships in archery training clubs and institutes across the world. This has directly impacted growth in demand for archery equipment and consumer demand is anticipated to go Northward in the coming years.

Archery Equipment Market Witnessing Significant Growth in Developed Regional Markets

Archery is one of the most common sports activities in Europe and governments in the EU have established several institutional bodies to encourage increasing public participation in the sport. This has led to a rise in the sales of archery equipment across countries in Europe. In North America, the governments in U.S and Canada are conducting several archery programs for children in schools, thereby promoting the sport throughout the continent. This is expected to lead to a rise in the demand for archery equipment across North America.
