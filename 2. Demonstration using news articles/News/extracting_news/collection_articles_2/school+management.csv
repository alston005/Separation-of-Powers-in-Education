Currently, instead of SMC, city schools have Parents Teachers Associations (PTA), which aims at building good relations between teachers/management and parents for the benefit of students. Yet parents seem dissatisfied with the major decisions taken by schools.

Meanwhile, the state education department is getting a good response from parents and schools in Zilla Parishad and other taluka-level in the state.

Some of the highlights of SMC in rural schools include, 'A day at school', where parents along with grandparents and siblings spend the entire day at school with teachers, headmistress and the student.

There is also the 'Personalised mid-day meal', which is created by teachers and parents together as per the ingredients schools receive for the mid-day meal every month.

""By mixing, matching and twisting the ingredients, a new dish is created once or twice a week to charge the students,"" a teacher from the Nashik district school said.

'HM-Parents brainstorming' is another innovative programme under the SMC which helps both the stakeholders to understand students' requirements in order to increase productivity.

SMC and PTA both functions equally however a major difference is the level of involvement.

Prachi Sathe, officer on special duty of state government explained, ""PTA is limited to open houses, fee hike discussions, etc. While with SMC, a student is discussed in and out by the teacher and the parents. This way, both of them know what is to be done to help the student do better in every way. Moreover, education is looked at in a different manner in rural areas as most students are first generation learners.""

The state education department is in talks with schools in the city to bring SMC in all level schools including civic, government-aided and open board schools."

International Business is undergoing a paramount transformation with the arrival of new technologies, shrinking boundaries, and the growing cosmopolitan culture. The Indian market itself has become a thriving ground for international talent and with the growing entrepreneurship in the Indian Subcontinent, the global demand for cutting-edge business solutions and inventive minds is on the rise.

Among the leading Indian B-Schools, FORE School of Management has wholeheartedly embraced the wind of change and has fully committed itself to foster the sharpest minds in the business world with a special focus on the global business climate. The New Delhi Based Business School has trained young minds and launched the careers of many with several of its students heading the major departments across an impressive array of verticals.

Recently, the FORE School of Management conducted an International Immersion Programme to facilitate a global and progressive learning environment for the students. In a brief programme spanning almost a week, IIP focused on providing students the international exposure and a platform for exchanging ideas and practices through streamlined lectures by the major academicians.

The 2018 IIP had 5 highly specialized and cutting-edge courses:

During the 2018 IIP, students visited various companies in Singapore like Grey Orange, Expara, Olam, and DHL as an essential part of their academic program. Technology group students also relished the first-hand experience of 3D printing at 3D Printing Lab of NTU. With a fully residential program like this, students sojourned at an excellent residential facility of Nanyang Executive Centre, part of NTU, Singapore.

Five highly specialized courses developed by Nanyang Business School, Singapore faculty based on their intensive research experience are conducted over a week period for FORE students. Apart from the rigorous academic inputs, IIP provides insights into Singapore's Econo-political, business, social, and cultural life.""

With the 2018 IIP, PGDM IB students got the chance to interact with and learn from Prof. Patrick Gibbons, the Jefferson Smurfit Professor teaching Strategic Management at the University College Dublin who conducted the course for IB students at the Nanyang Executive Centre, Singapore. Prof. Gibbons introduced the students to some of the most ground-breaking International Competitive Strategies, designed to tackle the most formidable challenges that managers often face because of the unpredictable international business climate. International Competitive Strategies Course highlighted the pathways for managers who struggle with the changing business climate and illuminated methods concerning how they should deploy the business assets and resources to achieve the optimal output.

PGDM 2016-2018 batch's student Akshay Sood recounts his brilliant IIP experience at NEC, Singapore. He journalized his IIP experience via a photo-story and remarked that it indeed brought him face to face with the challenging global business climate. Akshay mentioned in his photo story that it was curiosity and an insatiable hunger for knowing more that took him to Singapore and the moment he stepped on the massive campus of Nanyang, he knew that it was the wisest trip he had made.

Akshay spent six days with his friends and batchmates in Singapore, learning from the best and recounted how fruitful the visit to the several established companies like Expara, DHL, Grey Orange, etc. were.

Despite experts from the National Institute of Technology-Calicut (NIT-C) expressing willingness to conduct a technical study on the colonial era building on the premises of St. Joseph's Anglo-Indian Girls Higher Secondary School, the management continues to maintain its opposition to the Culture Department's bid to declare it as a protected monument.

According to sources, the proposal for the study was put forward during the course of informal talks between representatives of the management, a group of old students who are batting for the protection of the building, and heritage enthusiasts.

The effort was to find out the feasibility of retaining the building and examine the architectural parameters involved. However, the management is learnt to have backtracked on the proposal.

Meanwhile, historian M.G.S. Narayanan has written to V. Venu, Secretary, Department of Culture, pointing out the need to conserve the few heritage structures remaining in Kozhikode town. Mr. Narayanan said that though Kozhikode could boast a rich heritage, its symbols such as the Hajoor Kacheri, had been demolished.

""It is painful to know that there is a plan to demolish the historically important building connected to Mother Veronica. A native of France, she has a unique place in the history of Kozhikode as the one who set up the first school for girls in Malabar in the 19th century, when education was a dream for the female population,"" he said in the letter.

The century-old structure reflecting the grandeur of colonial architecture has a pride of place in Kozhikode. ""At a time when modern technology is being used to conserve such buildings, efforts to bring it down in the name of security are condemnable,"" Mr. Narayanan said.

Congratulating the Culture Department for proposing to declare it as a protected monument, the historian said that the demolition of the building would be a blot on the image of the Apostolic Carmel, who have rendered yeomen service to society for over a century.

Sources close to the management told The Hindu on Monday that at a time when many age-old government schools were being demolished to make way for new buildings with advanced facilities, there was no point in retaining the structure there.

The management was not taken into confidence before the Culture Department issued the gazette notification proposing to declare the building as a protected monument.

The regional town planner had submitted a report ruling out the antiquity of the building and it was not 100 years old too.

""We have filed an appeal against the Culture Department's gazette notification. The date of the hearing is yet to be intimated,"" Varun Bhaskar, PTA president, said."

The decision, taken by the university's executive council, comes amid a renaming spree where the Centre and several state governments have decided to dedicate projects to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stalwart.

While the Uttar Pradesh government, led by Yogi Adityanath, has decided to name the proposed Bundelkhand Expressway as 'Atal Path', Chhattisgarh's upcoming capital Naya Raipur will be known as Atal Nagar.

A 'ghat' on the Sabarmati River in Gujarat, the AIIMS Rishikesh auditorium and the cyber tower in Mauritius, which was set up with Vajpayee's help, will also be named after him.

Apart from these, several states have requested the Centre to allow them to rename landmarks after Vajpayee. These include proposals from Andhra Pradesh to name AIIMS Mangalagiri after the former PM, one from Himachal Pradesh to rename the Rohtang Tunnel, another from Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to change the name of the Habibganj railway station and a personal request from an Assam BJP legislator to call the Bogibeel Bridge on Brahmaputra river 'Atal Setu'.

The former prime minister's ashes were also immersed in rivers across the country, from the Gomti in Lucknow to Imphal river in Manipur, with several BJP leaders leading the processions in the states.

While the governments are of the opinion that renaming institutions, roads and welfare schemes after Vajpayee would be a fitting tribute to a man considered an astute politician and a master negotiator, not everyone is happy with the developments.

Almost a week after the former prime minister's death, his niece Karuna Shukla on Thursday raked up a controversy by alleging that the BJP was politicising Vajpayee's demise for electoral gains in the 2019 polls.

""The BJP is selfish and doing politics in the name of Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Using his name, they are prepping for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls,"" Shukla said in an interview to News18.

She alleged that the saffron party profited from Vajpayee's name during his lifetime and was using his name after his death for political gains. ""The BJP is not at all ashamed over politicising his death,"" said Shukla, a former Lok Sabha MP who was denied a ticket by the BJP in 2014 and later resigned from the party.

The Congress, too, accused the BJP of trying to gain political mileage out of Vajpayee's death. ""The last rites are performed by family members for peace of the departed soul,"" the party tweeted. ""PM Modi and the BJP have usurped the last remains of Former PM Vajpayee and are using it for petty political gains. BJP leaders discover new lows everyday,"" Congress said on its official Twitter handle.

Vajpayee, one of India's tallest leaders and the first non-Congress Prime Minister to complete a full term in power by leading a tenuous coalition with his inclusive politics and superlative oratory, died on August 16 after a prolonged illness. He was 93."

SMCs are statutory bodies constituted under the Right to Education Act, 2009, which have to ensure the effective functioning of the schools, and welfare of the children. SMCs are expected to solve the local problems schools face.

SMCs play an important role in improving the quality of education at government-run schools in the National Capital Region (NCR). Members of the SMCs are usually the parents, people's representatives, educationists, members of self-help groups, etc.

""We have been working towards strengthening the SMCs and increasing their participation. We are motivating and training them,"" said Prasad.

Capacity-building exercises will be conducted for SMCs, which will cover three fronts -- functions, functionaries and funds. Prasad said functions of the SMCs are defined in the Right To Education Act and various government resolutions. ""It is important that SMC members have a good educational background. We have allocated Rs 5 lakh per SMC, apart from a corpus of nearly Rs 3 crore at ITDP, which schools can use, if there is a shortage of funds,"" he added.

The SMCs have been asked to prepare a development plan to use the unspent corpus, and make fresh demands. Only work that benefits students will be taken up, said Prasad.

""The purchases will be effected by September and new constructions, if any, will be undertaken between October and December,"" he added.

In order to ensure that SMC meetings are held regularly, it has been suggested that committees in each school conduct a meeting on the 25th of every month.

Also, a calendar listing nearly 200 progarmmes has been drawn up to help students express themselves beyond academics.

Prasad said this would be the first time such a capacity-building exercise was taken up at government schools."

IÃSEG School of Management, France, is a prestigious institution which impart quality education in management, specifically, in international business. IÃSEG has triple accreditation from EQUIS, AMBA and AACSB, and has two campuses: one at Lille and another in Paris.

I was at the Lille campus, the oldest of the two, as part of the student exchange programme sponsored by my home university, Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, New Delhi, to pursue the third trimester of my MBA. I was also selected to the Grande Ãcole programme here. IÃSEG belongs to the ConfÃ©rence des Grandes Ãcoles (CGE), a French national institution, established in 1973. Conditions of entry to the CGE are strict, and the member institutions and the degrees they award are highly regarded by academia and the industry alike. It was a tremendous experience, where I got to meet budding professionals from universities in Australia, Canada Argentina, and Korea. There is also a huge community of Indian students from various institutes such as the IIMs, XLRI, SP Jain, NMIMS, and more, making it hard to feel homesick.

Pedagogic style

The skill imparting techniques used at the school were unique. There were several world-renowned faculty, including French diplomats and persons of eminence in public service, with proven ability in the field of management. The course content and syllabus were also different. Critical management problems are formed as subjects. Knowledge was imparted intensively through group work, presentation, debate and continuous assessment. Our deliberations involved many case studies from current problems happening in the world.

In between, there were also discussions about business challenges and opportunities in various countries. In this era of globalised business, the networking opportunities given to the students of this programme is a tremendous advantage. IÃSEG offers many courses in management for international students, in French and English. Knowledge in French is an advantage, but not a must. Non-French-speaking students have separate classes for French. IÃSEG offers various graduate, post-graduate and Ph.D. programmes.

In partnership with IÃSEG's Alumni Network, the school organises meetings throughout the year between its students and professionals from across business sectors. The campus recruitment team holds career fairs where students are offered internships (6 months), gap years (cÃ©sures), apprenticeship contracts, consulting projects or job offers from major brands.

Lille, the scenic city, is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region in northern France. A cultural hub and bustling university city today, it was once an important merchant centre of French Flanders, and many Flemish influences still remain. Being well connected with the Eurail system, the whole of Europe is truly just a train ride away. Exactly why students head out to neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg or Amsterdam for weekend getaways!"

The school management, however, claimed that the student had a history of epilepsy and had collapsed on previous occasions. ""On Tuesday, she had a similar seizure and we immediately alerted the parents,"" a school member claimed.

Upadhyaya also denied hitting the girl. ""I did not touch her. She collapsed after her seizure. The police may verify this with other students in class,"" she said.
