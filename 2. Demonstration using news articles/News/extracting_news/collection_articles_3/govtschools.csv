(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

This information was given by the Minister of State (HRD), Dr. Satya Pal Singh today in a written reply to a Lok Sabha question."

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Narsipur taluk are preparing for the English fest tomorrow

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

However, Department of Schools Education, Kashmir (DSEK) has given allowance to some private schools for only remedial classes that even on terms and conditions.

A number of parents said that there are several private schools that are giving winter tutorials to the students in the early morning.

Parents while questioning the government order regarding the winter vacations said, ""If the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK) has announced the winter vacation in all schools so that the students will evade the biting cold and when it is not being implemented on ground level then what is the fun of announcing such vacations.""

One of the parents wishing anonymity said that there are some private schools that function for winter schooling, where classes start from 10 Am upto 2 PM.

He said, ""This freezing winter has returned after many years and the students are being compelled to attend the winter schooling starting from 10 Am.""

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

Another parent while lamenting on the issue said that her ward felt ill twice due the cold and he is not able to go for winter schooling in the misty morning.

Director Education, Kashmir, Ghulam Nabi Itoo, said that the department had already issued the circular regarding the functioning of the winter schooling in the valley.

He said, ""We have only allowed private schools for only remedial classes and we have asked the concerned authorities to make proper arrangements of heating and seating available."" ""The scheduled timing for the approved private schools and the coaching centres is from 11 AM to 3 PM,"" he said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

A week ago, half-yearly examination question papers for Classes IX, X, XI and XII were leaked by a group of students at a government-aided school in Sivaganga district. A case was registered.

Reacting to the allegations that government school teachers were forcing students to clean school premises as a punishment, he said, ""students were not forced to clean the school premises. They cleaned the premises to keep it clean just like how they used to do it at home.""

The minister launched construction work of overhead water tanks, parks and roads worth Rs 8 crore in Kullampalayam, Modachur and Kottupullampalayam village panchayats in Gobichettipalayam."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid. Their extension of work contract has now been approved and the salaries will be released in the next few days,"" he added."

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays."

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided.

The state had recently said in an order that a total of 7,728 government and government-aided schools would get the biometric attendance system for teachers. Of these, 3,688 are high schools and 4,040 are higher secondary schools."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

Anger simmers in the villages of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. It has been five days since Cyclone Gaja reduced their homes to rubble. A sea of discontentment is all that remains for the people in Thalayamangalam in Tiruvarur and Vizhanthamavadi in Nagapattinam districts. Despite the TN Chief Minister's claims that relief works started hours after the cyclone made landfall, people in these two villages deny it completely.

Villagers are involved in protests across the districts in the past two days alleging that no relief has come from the government's side for them. ""We (common men) immediately pitched in money and bought power saws to cut the trees. The trees in Rajagopalapuram village were cleared by the villagers after a lot of struggle.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's pet scheme to promote solar energy in households through a subsidy scheme has been left languishing in cold storage since her death in 2016. She had announced the 'Capital Incentive Scheme' to promote solar energy among domestic consumers by giving a capital subsidy of ₹20,000 per kilo watt (KW) for grid-connected photo voltaic systems in the State.

She had also set a target of 10,000 domestic consumers as per the Government Order of the Energy Department, dated October 18, 2013. However, since the launch of the programme, the State has not been able to reach even the half-way mark of 5,000.

4. 32-Year-Old Man Murdered in TN, Police Probe If It Is a Case of Hate Killing

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

6. 187 Buses Shifted from CMBT to KK Nagar Depot

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

In a first, Mr. Sisodia, who is also Education Minister, began a series of meetings with heads of schools, starting with 150 on Wednesday, a government statement said. He will be meeting heads of all around 1,000 Delhi government schools in the coming days.

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Appealing to heads of schools to use the amount efficiently, Mr. Sisodia said: ""You can now hire teachers for up to 200 hours and you can engage gardeners. Depending on the need for cleanliness and other sanitation issues, you can also hire additional labour.""

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

""The government's failure has resulted in public outrage,"" he said.

He alleged that the private schools, which include elite ones, reportedly charge the commission of around 40 to 60 per cent on books being sold by them in the school premises or at the designated bookshops.

Chowdhary said school management is facilitating the sale of the books on the advise of the parents for their own conveniences.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

""School is only a facilitator between parents and the booksellers. They don't have to earn any profit or commission from the booksellers as they are being accused of.

""We have to take into consideration the wishes of the parents how they feel comfortable. The sale of the books at one place only makes things easier for the parents.""

According to officials at Government Boys' School, Karol Bagh, the classes remained irregular due to the ""unavailability"" of teachers. ""There was no permanent mathematics teacher for class 10 till August-end in our school, so classes could not be held regularly. A post-graduate teacher (PGT) who teaches class 11 and 12 filled in and took some classes.

""After the promotion of many TGTs as PGTs, there occurs a shortage of permanent TGTs in the school for many subjects such as Hindi, English and mathematics.

Sanjay Goel, director, DoE, accepted these problems. ""Some schools have also approached us saying there were technical glitches while uploading marks online. They said the scores for practicals could not be uploaded, due to which the score of their students were below the pass-mark. However, they have added the practical marks in the hard copy of results handed to parents last month,"" he said.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and P Rajamanickam passed the interim order on a plea by Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK)'s Cheyyur town secretary M Thiagarajan seeking action against the correspondent of RC Middle School, a government aided institution for allegedly compelling students to clean the toilet.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

According to the petitioner, his wife Parvathi was working as a science teacher in the school for the past 10 years on consolidated pay. But after the incident came to light and the petitioner sent representations to various authorities seeking action against the management, his wife was terminated without any reason, he said. It was purely to take revenge against him, the petitioner submitted. The management claimed it was the petitioner's wife who made the children clean toilets and that was why she was sacked.

The petitioner further submitted that undeterred by the action of the management he continued to petition the collector to take appropriate action against the correspondent and ensure toilets were cleaning only by sanitary workers.

The act of the school management not only amounted to abuse of children against the Constitution it also meant forced manual scavenging as they were compelled to clean the toilets without any safety gadgets, the petitioner submitted.

As the authorities failed to take any action on his representations he approached the high court. When the plea came up for hearing, the bench directed the collector to file the report and posted the plea to January 25 for further hearing."

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

One biometric machine was being provided for every 100 students, with managements being directed to record attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal.

""The attendance recorded on the biometric machines will be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal. As it is linked with Aadhaar, the managements cannot duplicate admissions,"" an official said.

The machines and software were designed in such a way that biometric fingerprints captured are immediately verified with the biometric details available with UIDAI using Internet and is reflected in the dashboard of the School Education Department's website. A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

""Most students and teachers in schools where the machines are already in use are giving their attendance on it. The department sent a proposal to the government seeking budget for implementing the system in all schools from the next academic year,"" an official said, adding that there were some network issues in certain schools located in remote areas with these being sorted out."

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block. This panel can be seen without any password.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Special concession

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers. Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree with Mathematics or Physics or Engineering subjects for Mathematics subject. Hence the graduates from engineering will be eligible for qualifying in Mathematics subject."

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school.

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

Pertinently, the State Government on Thursday announced winter vacations for all schools in Kashmir division and winter zones of Jammu division from December-6 to March- 03 2019 upto 8th standard and December-17 to March February 23 2019 for 9th standard onwards."

He was speaking after inaugurating the centenary celebrations of Gadichowka Government School in Lakshmipuram, organised by Reachout India, Inner Wheel Club of Mysore West, DRC Cinemas and other educational institutions recently and said the school has contributed immensely by helping thousands of poor students in the last 100 years to make a mark in the society.

This is where the contribution of NGOs like Reachout India and organisations like Rotary and Lions become important as they can provide basic facilities like libraries, toilets, books and desks to run such schools, which are starved of funds, he said.

He said that if everyone has to be educated then the government schools' standards should be improved and see that the parents and students seek these schools to learn.

This can happen only if every parent sends his or her child to school, he added.

On the occasion, Vana Mahotsava was also celebrated by planting a few saplings. The newly painted classrooms with colourful pictures were inaugurated by South Zone Block Education Officer Shivakumar."

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme. ""It was more than two months ago that the last batch of students completed training here. After that no school has sent their students to make use of the opportunity,"" said Premkumar, a fireman as well as member of scuba diving team of the department, who is one among the trainers. At present around 300 children are taking swimming lessons at the facility, but all of them are from private schools and enrolled by their parents not schools.

Abdul Rasheed, district fire officer, said as per Jalaraksha scheme, people could avail swimming lessons for their wards from the personnel of all local fire stations, provided there was a pool in the locality. ""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent. He also added that the lukewarm response to the project was because of the apathy of teaching faculty. ""A teacher should act as a nodal officer, taking responsibility of bringing students for training. Nobody is ready to put in extra effort in this regard. They always cite reasons such as lack of sufficient time,"" he said."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both.

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

Chowdhary said school management is facilitating the sale of the books on the advise of the parents for their own conveniences.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

Schools run by the West Bengal government will soon have to put up a notice in classrooms, with detailed information about the curricula and chapters that would be taught by the teachers during a particular semester, an official said.

A notification has been issued by the department of school education, asking all state-run schools to abide by the instruction from the next academic session, he said.

""The new rule is aimed at giving the students a clear idea about what they will learn before the next summative internal assessment test. It will also apprise the teachers of the lessons they need to cover in a given period,"" the school department official said.

Three summative assessment tests are held every year in state-run schools - one during March-April, second around July-August and the third in November-December.

""Ideally, the schools can also put up the same notice somewhere on its campus, where the parents have access. The notice will have to be updated from time to time so that students have no confusion about their academic progress,"" the state official said.

The government's move came in the wake of frequent complaints by students that teachers do not cover syllabi properly, he said.

""While the students claim that syllabus has not been covered in classrooms, the teachers allege that those complaining either skip schools or remain hooked to their mobile phones during lessons,"" he maintained.

The school education department has also stressed the importance of holding regular parent-teacher meetings for the overall benefit of the students, the official said.

""The parents should have knowledge about the performance of their wards, their strengths and weaknesses,"" he added.

According to the Conrad Challenge website, however, the team registrations are ""closed for 2018-19"".

The DGSE order has an attached copy of the letter from Punjab health department issued in November by the director, Health Services.

The health department letters says that according to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), the main aim is to curb the industry's ""interference"" in the campaign.

DGSE Parshant Goyal told The Indian Express that they had also received an advisory from the MHRD, Government of India, apart from the letter from the health department. ""The MHRD had directed us to issue instructions to the schools to stay away from such competitions because such organisations contact the school directly without informing the education department authorities,"" said he, however, adding that no one from Conard Challenge has approached the department till date."

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it.

""Teachers need to be provided training in order to improve the quality of teaching and bring government primary schools on par with private schools. However, this is not happening and, hence, Goan parents prefer to wait in queues to enrol their wards in private schools,"" he lamented.

The government is providing smart boards, projectors, laptops to government primary schools, however, teachers should get necessary training, he said, adding, the government needs to hire a consultant to improve quality of education in government primary school. [NT]"

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid. Their extension of work contract has now been approved and the salaries will be released in the next few days,"" he added."

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured.

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme.

""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

2. In Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam, Villagers Angry with Govt Response After Gaja

Anger simmers in the villages of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. It has been five days since Cyclone Gaja reduced their homes to rubble. A sea of discontentment is all that remains for the people in Thalayamangalam in Tiruvarur and Vizhanthamavadi in Nagapattinam districts. Despite the TN Chief Minister's claims that relief works started hours after the cyclone made landfall, people in these two villages deny it completely.

Villagers are involved in protests across the districts in the past two days alleging that no relief has come from the government's side for them. ""We (common men) immediately pitched in money and bought power saws to cut the trees. The trees in Rajagopalapuram village were cleared by the villagers after a lot of struggle. Even now there are a lot of trees fallen here,"" one said.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's pet scheme to promote solar energy in households through a subsidy scheme has been left languishing in cold storage since her death in 2016. She had announced the 'Capital Incentive Scheme' to promote solar energy among domestic consumers by giving a capital subsidy of ₹20,000 per kilo watt (KW) for grid-connected photo voltaic systems in the State.

She had also set a target of 10,000 domestic consumers as per the Government Order of the Energy Department, dated October 18, 2013. However, since the launch of the programme, the State has not been able to reach even the half-way mark of 5,000.

4. 32-Year-Old Man Murdered in TN, Police Probe If It Is a Case of Hate Killing

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

According to the Tamil Nadu Scrap Merchant and Dealers in Second Hand Property and Owner of Auto-mobile Workshop and Tinkering Shop (Regulations Control and Licensing) Act 1985, the shop owners should have proof pertaining to when and from whom they purchased the equipment. ""However, most of the roadside shops selling the second-hand mobile phones do not have any proof and they do not produce any bill on purchase of the equipment. We suspect that stolen mobile phones can flood these shops,"" said a senior police officer.

6. 187 Buses Shifted from CMBT to KK Nagar Depot

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

In a first, Mr. Sisodia, who is also Education Minister, began a series of meetings with heads of schools, starting with 150 on Wednesday, a government statement said. He will be meeting heads of all around 1,000 Delhi government schools in the coming days.

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Appealing to heads of schools to use the amount efficiently, Mr. Sisodia said: ""You can now hire teachers for up to 200 hours and you can engage gardeners. Depending on the need for cleanliness and other sanitation issues, you can also hire additional labour.""

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

According to the Delhi government's Directorate of Education (DoE), only 30% of class 10 students and 50% of class 12 students passed the mid-term exams conducted in September.

According to officials at Government Boys' School, Karol Bagh, the classes remained irregular due to the ""unavailability"" of teachers. ""There was no permanent mathematics teacher for class 10 till August-end in our school, so classes could not be held regularly. A post-graduate teacher (PGT) who teaches class 11 and 12 filled in and took some classes. Similarly, the PGT for English was appointed very late, due to which the classes were irregular,"" an official at the school, who wished to remain anonymous, said.

Similarly, officials at another school in Jor Bagh, where a parent had helped the class 12 students complete the Physics syllabus last year because of the unavailability of teachers, also complained of a delay in the appointment of trained graduate teachers (TGTs), who are eligible to teach up to class 10, this time around. ""After the promotion of many TGTs as PGTs, there occurs a shortage of permanent TGTs in the school for many subjects such as Hindi, English and mathematics. The guest teachers were assigned late and, hence, the classes for these subjects were interrupted till August,"" an official said.

Sanjay Goel, director, DoE, accepted these problems. ""Some schools have also approached us saying there were technical glitches while uploading marks online. They said the scores for practicals could not be uploaded, due to which the score of their students were below the pass-mark. However, they have added the practical marks in the hard copy of results handed to parents last month,"" he said.

The DoE Monday summoned all the zonal education officers and head of schools (HoS) where results were below average and discussed a course of action. ""All the zonal education officers have been asked to conduct surprise visits to schools under their jurisdiction and all HoS directed to prepare modules for mock tests and extra classes for students set to take the board-level exams. The HoS are also going to sit in the classes where a large number of students failed. We are expecting to improve the results in the pre-board exams, to be held in December,"" Goel said.

Last year, only 31% students passed the class 10 pre-board exams, following which the DoE issued show-cause notices to as many as 120 schools. The results, however, improved to 69.32 % in the board exams."

Currently, the reimbursement in Maharashtra is approximately Rs 17,000 per year per child, but some school owners say that it is very less as compared to their original fee structure.

A school trustee in Nagpur said that only budget schools would charge lower but very few people line up for admissions in such schools.

""CBSE-affiliated schools are mostly in demand followed by state's English medium schools. The cheapest CBSE school in Nagpur would charge around Rs 25,000 annually but the average cost would be nearer to Rs 35,000. This means the government's reimbursement is half of what schools are charging to non-RTE students,"" said the trustee.

These are some of the issues the school owners will be discussing in December when they meet for a state-level conference in Chandrapur. TOI had reported about the latest RTE guidelines and how schools expressed unhappiness over the government's increasing paperwork.

While western Maharashtra-based trustee associations' leaders spoke openly against the government policies, local members preferred to remain anonymous. ""The government is putting its responsibilities on us. We have been asked to reserve 25% seats and we don't have any problem with that, but it should make financial sense.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

In the convocation, as many as 1,161 students, comprising 504 undergraduates, 656 post graduates and one doctorate, were awarded degrees.

Thirty-eight chancellor gold medal, vice-chancellor gold medal and exemplary performance silver plaque were given to students across the years at the event.

Baijal congratulated the students and also suggested that entrepreneurs should be supported by the government when they start out.

'Metro man' E Sreedharan was the chief guest at the event. He said the future of the country lies in the hands of engineers and technocrats and not politicians.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

In a first, Mr. Sisodia, who is also Education Minister, began a series of meetings with heads of schools, starting with 150 on Wednesday, a government statement said. He will be meeting heads of all around 1,000 Delhi government schools in the coming days.

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Appealing to heads of schools to use the amount efficiently, Mr. Sisodia said: ""You can now hire teachers for up to 200 hours and you can engage gardeners. Depending on the need for cleanliness and other sanitation issues, you can also hire additional labour.""

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

""The government's failure has resulted in public outrage,"" he said.

He alleged that the private schools, which include elite ones, reportedly charge the commission of around 40 to 60 per cent on books being sold by them in the school premises or at the designated bookshops.

Chowdhary said school management is facilitating the sale of the books on the advise of the parents for their own conveniences.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

""School is only a facilitator between parents and the booksellers. They don't have to earn any profit or commission from the booksellers as they are being accused of.

Teams from government and private schools will be allowed to participate. The top performing team will be awarded by the chief minister and the members will be trained to participate in the next year's Republic Day parade in New Delhi.

The concept of school bands is mostly unknown to government school in the state while it is rare for a private school to have its band.

According to Agra district inspector of schools (DIOS) Ravindra Singh, the move is aimed at developing the spirit of patriotism among students. The directives were received earlier this month and have been conveyed to all government and private secondary schools. In a letter to all district education officials, Sandhya Tiwari, director of the state project (Madhyamik Siksha Abhiyan) said, ""School band encourages a feeling of oneness, belonging and a deep sense of pride in schoolchildren. The rhythm instills a feeling of action, courage and patriotism in children. The school band competition will help develop these feelings in all schools of the state.""

A senior official concerned with state projects said, ""The primary purpose of the school band competition is to ensure that all schools have formed bands and performances take place regularly. Schools are required to make available their application at the DIOS office by November 13.""

""The school band competition will be first conducted in six zones. Top performing teams at the zone level will compete at the state level. The best team may be given chance to participate in the Republic Day parade in New Delhi,"" he said.

According to sources, most of the 827 UP Board affiliated schools in the district don't have a band. The DIOS office is contacting school authorities to form them in a time-bound manner. CBSE and ICSE board schools have also been asked to participate in the band competition."

Sanjay Goel, director, DoE, accepted these problems. ""Some schools have also approached us saying there were technical glitches while uploading marks online.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows.

He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments. In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres.

On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil.

Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes. Farmers rued that the bovines were destroying crops.

""Cows and bulls have become a huge nuisance, eating crops and destroying greenery,"" complained a farmer of Barauli Ahir block, Ramesh.

A farmer from Bichpuri, Ram Bharosey, said groups of villagers with sticks in hands have to keep moving around to ensure the cattle were kept away from fields.

Several farmers also raised concern over what they called as 'population explosion' of cattle.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

The attendance of teaching and non-teaching staff will be recorded twice a day -- morning and evening -- and for students, before serving the mid-day meal, so that the attendance recorded on the biometric machines could be matched with the bills submitted by school managements to ascertain the number of students consuming the mid-day meal."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

A software was being developed to transmit the captured details offline or when network is available in the schools located in remote areas.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers. Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree with Mathematics or Physics or Engineering subjects for Mathematics subject.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints.

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

The present RTE rules does not stipulate parents to approach government schools before applying in private schools and students are eligible for the RTE fee reimbursement.

The minister justifying the changes has said, we need to improve the student enrolment in government schools as we are neglecting it, added that priority should be given to improve standard of education in government schools."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays."

Government-run schools in Jammu and Kashmir are without text books as authorities say that the truck -- carrying the consignment was stuck ""somewhere"" in Jammu-Srinagar highway.

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

Pertinently, the State Government on Thursday announced winter vacations for all schools in Kashmir division and winter zones of Jammu division from December-6 to March- 03 2019 upto 8th standard and December-17 to March February 23 2019 for 9th standard onwards."

This is where the contribution of NGOs like Reachout India and organisations like Rotary and Lions become important as they can provide basic facilities like libraries, toilets, books and desks to run such schools, which are starved of funds, he said.

He said that if everyone has to be educated then the government schools' standards should be improved and see that the parents and students seek these schools to learn.

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme. ""It was more than two months ago that the last batch of students completed training here. After that no school has sent their students to make use of the opportunity,"" said Premkumar, a fireman as well as member of scuba diving team of the department, who is one among the trainers. At present around 300 children are taking swimming lessons at the facility, but all of them are from private schools and enrolled by their parents not schools.

Abdul Rasheed, district fire officer, said as per Jalaraksha scheme, people could avail swimming lessons for their wards from the personnel of all local fire stations, provided there was a pool in the locality. ""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent. He also added that the lukewarm response to the project was because of the apathy of teaching faculty. ""A teacher should act as a nodal officer, taking responsibility of bringing students for training. Nobody is ready to put in extra effort in this regard.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both.

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

But the parents are bearing the brunt of this nexus which needs to be broken,"" Tarigami said.

He urged the Government to immediately issue instructions to private schools to stop this ""illegal profiteering"" by selling books at exorbitant rates.

Chowdhary said school management is facilitating the sale of the books on the advise of the parents for their own conveniences.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

""School is only a facilitator between parents and the booksellers. They don't have to earn any profit or commission from the booksellers as they are being accused of. If parents are overcharged or if they have any complaint, the Legal Meteorology department can take action against the bookseller or retailers or publisher as per the consumer protection laws,"" he said.

Chowdhary said over 90 percent parents of the students are seeking facility of sale of the books at one place and only less then 10 per cent parents make hue and cry.

""We have to take into consideration the wishes of the parents how they feel comfortable. The sale of the books at one place only makes things easier for the parents.""

JKJCCPS has urged government to take on board school associations along with the representatives of parents in resolving the issue amicably once for all instead of labeling them as extortionists which only harms education system here.

He schools make huge investment in the form of land, building, latest teaching aids only to provide quality education to the students so that they may only excel in academic but also compete with the best students in the world.

""Government should appreciate our works how we strive to provide quality education to the students but unfortunately the schools are being tagged as extortionists and their reputation is being unnecessarily harmed,"" said Chowdhary.

JKJCCPS warned if government continues to harass private schools without resolving the issues amicably, they would be compelled to take some actions to which only government will be responsible.

""Despite continuous harassment, schools have only sought amicable solution for the benefit of the students and comfort of the parents. However, it seems government doesn't want private schools to function properly and contribute to the quality education of the students,"" said JKJCCPS."

Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X.

NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children. In order to increase enrollment of children in government schools, the government is running schemes like free textbooks, uniforms and bicycles distribution. In this every year bill of crores rupees is wasted."

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

He said, ""This freezing winter has returned after many years and the students are being compelled to attend the winter schooling starting from 10 Am.""

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

Another parent while lamenting on the issue said that her ward felt ill twice due the cold and he is not able to go for winter schooling in the misty morning.

Director Education, Kashmir, Ghulam Nabi Itoo, said that the department had already issued the circular regarding the functioning of the winter schooling in the valley.

This apart, the petitioner also wanted the court to set up a district level committee of officials known for their integrity and commitment to cause of student welfare to inspect all government and government-aided schools to ensure adequate toilet facilities are provided along with sanitary workers.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely.

Three summative assessment tests are held every year in state-run schools - one during March-April, second around July-August and the third in November-December.

""Ideally, the schools can also put up the same notice somewhere on its campus, where the parents have access. The notice will have to be updated from time to time so that students have no confusion about their academic progress,"" the state official said.

The government's move came in the wake of frequent complaints by students that teachers do not cover syllabi properly, he said.

""While the students claim that syllabus has not been covered in classrooms, the teachers allege that those complaining either skip schools or remain hooked to their mobile phones during lessons,"" he maintained.

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards.

The Karnataka government had in October issued an order to introduce English-medium classes in 1,000 primary schools of the state from standard one. Responding to a query by Umesh Kotian of the BJP, during the question hour in the assembly, regarding steps taken to teach in English from the next academic year, Kumaraswamy said he was aware of the constraints of teaching in English. Those eligible to teach in English would be appointed after selection test.

He said, selected teachers would be given 15 days training at the entrance level from the Regional Institute of Education (RIE) after which they would have video conferencing with the institute every month. In response to another question, Kumaraswamy said adequate text books and smart classes facilities would be provided to teach in English, with the help of Department of State Education Research and Training (DSERT)."

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

""Despite being working hard all these months, sometimes on Sundays and holidays as well, our salaries have not been released. We all our working under duress and are sustaining ourselves by taking loans from friends, families and even from banks. We are under severe financial pressure,"" said another assistant.

Sanjay Goel, director of DoE, told TOI: ""The contract of the 670 IT assistants was for six months. Till June their salary has been paid. For the extension given from July, the salary has been processed and will be given to them soon.""

A representative from ICSIL said the IT Assistants were first hired for three months and in June, it was decided to extend their contract for one year. ""However, the file to extend their contract was not approved by the government, and that's why the salaries were not paid. Their extension of work contract has now been approved and the salaries will be released in the next few days,"" he added."

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays."

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

2. In Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam, Villagers Angry with Govt Response After Gaja

Anger simmers in the villages of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. It has been five days since Cyclone Gaja reduced their homes to rubble. A sea of discontentment is all that remains for the people in Thalayamangalam in Tiruvarur and Vizhanthamavadi in Nagapattinam districts. Despite the TN Chief Minister's claims that relief works started hours after the cyclone made landfall, people in these two villages deny it completely.

Villagers are involved in protests across the districts in the past two days alleging that no relief has come from the government's side for them. ""We (common men) immediately pitched in money and bought power saws to cut the trees. The trees in Rajagopalapuram village were cleared by the villagers after a lot of struggle.

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's pet scheme to promote solar energy in households through a subsidy scheme has been left languishing in cold storage since her death in 2016. She had announced the 'Capital Incentive Scheme' to promote solar energy among domestic consumers by giving a capital subsidy of ₹20,000 per kilo watt (KW) for grid-connected photo voltaic systems in the State.

She had also set a target of 10,000 domestic consumers as per the Government Order of the Energy Department, dated October 18, 2013. However, since the launch of the programme, the State has not been able to reach even the half-way mark of 5,000.

4. 32-Year-Old Man Murdered in TN, Police Probe If It Is a Case of Hate Killing

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

According to the Tamil Nadu Scrap Merchant and Dealers in Second Hand Property and Owner of Auto-mobile Workshop and Tinkering Shop (Regulations Control and Licensing) Act 1985, the shop owners should have proof pertaining to when and from whom they purchased the equipment. ""However, most of the roadside shops selling the second-hand mobile phones do not have any proof and they do not produce any bill on purchase of the equipment. We suspect that stolen mobile phones can flood these shops,"" said a senior police officer.

6. 187 Buses Shifted from CMBT to KK Nagar Depot

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

In a first, Mr. Sisodia, who is also Education Minister, began a series of meetings with heads of schools, starting with 150 on Wednesday, a government statement said. He will be meeting heads of all around 1,000 Delhi government schools in the coming days.

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Appealing to heads of schools to use the amount efficiently, Mr. Sisodia said: ""You can now hire teachers for up to 200 hours and you can engage gardeners. Depending on the need for cleanliness and other sanitation issues, you can also hire additional labour.""

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

In a statement issued on Tuesday, the CPI (M) State Secretary M Y Tarigami said till now the Government has failed to put a control on the nexus between the private schools and publishers, who are fleecing parents by selling textbook and notebooks at exorbitant prices. ""The government's failure has resulted in public outrage,"" he said.

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

""School is only a facilitator between parents and the booksellers. They don't have to earn any profit or commission from the booksellers as they are being accused of.

""We have to take into consideration the wishes of the parents how they feel comfortable. The sale of the books at one place only makes things easier for the parents.""

According to officials at Government Boys' School, Karol Bagh, the classes remained irregular due to the ""unavailability"" of teachers. ""There was no permanent mathematics teacher for class 10 till August-end in our school, so classes could not be held regularly. A post-graduate teacher (PGT) who teaches class 11 and 12 filled in and took some classes.

Similarly, officials at another school in Jor Bagh, where a parent had helped the class 12 students complete the Physics syllabus last year because of the unavailability of teachers, also complained of a delay in the appointment of trained graduate teachers (TGTs), who are eligible to teach up to class 10, this time around. ""After the promotion of many TGTs as PGTs, there occurs a shortage of permanent TGTs in the school for many subjects such as Hindi, English and mathematics. The guest teachers were assigned late and, hence, the classes for these subjects were interrupted till August,"" an official said.

Sanjay Goel, director, DoE, accepted these problems. ""Some schools have also approached us saying there were technical glitches while uploading marks online. They said the scores for practicals could not be uploaded, due to which the score of their students were below the pass-mark. However, they have added the practical marks in the hard copy of results handed to parents last month,"" he said.

The DoE Monday summoned all the zonal education officers and head of schools (HoS) where results were below average and discussed a course of action. ""All the zonal education officers have been asked to conduct surprise visits to schools under their jurisdiction and all HoS directed to prepare modules for mock tests and extra classes for students set to take the board-level exams.

A school trustee in Nagpur said that only budget schools would charge lower but very few people line up for admissions in such schools.

""CBSE-affiliated schools are mostly in demand followed by state's English medium schools. The cheapest CBSE school in Nagpur would charge around Rs 25,000 annually but the average cost would be nearer to Rs 35,000.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, In spite of many schemes including 'School Chalen Hum', running in the state, the number of children in government schools is declining year after year. This has been revealed in the report submitted by the school education department in the last assembly session.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children.

The Gautam Buddh Nagar administration has invited private players to join it in uplifting the infrastructure and quality of education in state-run primary schools under the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative, an official said.

Officials had said that the illegally-run school's building was in a ""poor and deteriorated"" condition.

""There are 685 government primary and upper primary schools. When the quality of established private schools is compared with government schools, there is a perceptible gap. The gap needs to be bridged,"" District Magistrate Brajesh Narain Singh said in an official letter last week.

While the initiative to invite private players is new, the administration had inked pacts with leading private firms such as the HCL Foundation and Paytm last year for partnership in around 100 schools.

Singh said of late, some good companies have come forward to play their roles under the CSR initiative and they have adopted the schools after signing a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the administration.

""Their work ranges from providing infrastructure facilities to improving the quality of education. At times the effort is in form of a joint venture as well. Many are doing good work.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

Fifty students of two government schools in Ballari and Bagalkot districts of Karnataka fell sick and have been hospitalised after having midday meals.

In the first incident, 20 students fell sick after a lizard reportedly fell in the sambar served during midday meals at Chikkamagii primary school in Hunagunda Taluk of Bagalkot district. Students complained of stomach ache, vomiting and diarrhoea and were immediately rushed to the district hospital.

In the second instance, about 30 students of a government school at Hagalur village in Siruguppa taluk of Ballari district too started complaining of stomach ache, dizziness and vomiting. They were rushed to the government hospital first and later shifted to Vijayanagara Institute of Medical Sciences. The cause of illness hasn't been known yet.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block. This panel can be seen without any password.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Special concession

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers. Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree with Mathematics or Physics or Engineering subjects for Mathematics subject. Hence the graduates from engineering will be eligible for qualifying in Mathematics subject."

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

He said they will try and ensure they take it to private schools as well.

In the convocation, as many as 1,161 students, comprising 504 undergraduates, 656 post graduates and one doctorate, were awarded degrees.

Thirty-eight chancellor gold medal, vice-chancellor gold medal and exemplary performance silver plaque were given to students across the years at the event.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well.

We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said."

The computer professionals said they joined the schools in June 2018, but were paid a month's salary only in November this year, a day before Diwali. The assistants claim their complaints to CM, deputy CM (who also holds the charge of the education department) and public grievance cell have failed to provide them a relief.

The assistants said they were hired by Intelligent Communication Systems India Limited (ICSIL) and sent to Delhi government's DoE, which, in turn, deployed them in various government schools.

""When we did not get our salary for three months, the company that hired us told us to contact the DoE. When we talked to the education department officials, they said paying salaries was the responsibility of the company that outsourced the manpower. We have only been shuttling between the two offices,"" said an IT Assistant, requesting anonymity.

The job responsibility of the assistants include managing the attendance of students and teachers, monitoring the e-mails, orders and circulars coming from the DoE and sharing them with the head of the school.

The education department had initially hired 1,068 IT Assistants and later advertised for another 670 more computer professionals for schools that have more than 1,200 students and thus have more work load. While the 1,068 IT Assistants, hired for two years, have been getting their salaries regularly, the 670 have not been paid.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

He was speaking after inaugurating the centenary celebrations of Gadichowka Government School in Lakshmipuram, organised by Reachout India, Inner Wheel Club of Mysore West, DRC Cinemas and other educational institutions recently and said the school has contributed immensely by helping thousands of poor students in the last 100 years to make a mark in the society.

This is where the contribution of NGOs like Reachout India and organisations like Rotary and Lions become important as they can provide basic facilities like libraries, toilets, books and desks to run such schools, which are starved of funds, he said.

He said that if everyone has to be educated then the government schools' standards should be improved and see that the parents and students seek these schools to learn.

This can happen only if every parent sends his or her child to school, he added.

On the occasion, Vana Mahotsava was also celebrated by planting a few saplings. The newly painted classrooms with colourful pictures were inaugurated by South Zone Block Education Officer Shivakumar."

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme. ""It was more than two months ago that the last batch of students completed training here. After that no school has sent their students to make use of the opportunity,"" said Premkumar, a fireman as well as member of scuba diving team of the department, who is one among the trainers. At present around 300 children are taking swimming lessons at the facility, but all of them are from private schools and enrolled by their parents not schools.

Abdul Rasheed, district fire officer, said as per Jalaraksha scheme, people could avail swimming lessons for their wards from the personnel of all local fire stations, provided there was a pool in the locality. ""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent. He also added that the lukewarm response to the project was because of the apathy of teaching faculty. ""A teacher should act as a nodal officer, taking responsibility of bringing students for training. Nobody is ready to put in extra effort in this regard. They always cite reasons such as lack of sufficient time,"" he said."

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

Speaking to heads of schools about the ₹5 lakh to ₹7 lakh SMC fund per school, Mr. Sisodia said: ""Now you have the financial grants and powers both. Till now, heads of schools were dependant on the Directorate of Education for every small work. Heads of schools are the chairpersons of SMCs, and together with the elected members they can now run their schools efficiently.""

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

He said like any other commodity sold in the market, books are sold to parents as per the MRPs only and no parent is overcharged.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

In the last three years six lakh children have left the government schools. Chhindwara district tops in the number of dropouts, whereas Satna and Rewa are second and Shivpuri is in third place.

Children enrolled in government schools through school education department are counted through mid-day meal and free textbook distribution. The number of children in the year 2015-16 is 76,23,522, which fell to only 70,20,008 in the year 2017-18.

All the schemes are aimed at luring the children to the government school. Funds of crores are given under 'School Chale Hum' campaign by the Central Government. The entire budget is also being spent every year, but still the number of children is falling in schools.

Either this budget is being spent on paper, or the schemes are not proving to be effective in attracting children.

Narsipur taluk are preparing for the English fest tomorrow

Suneetha and her classmates at Government Higher Primary School at Madrahalli in T. Narsipur taluk of Mysuru district have been reciting English rhymes in the last fortnight as the day to present their newly acquired English talent is fast approaching.

The school in the tiny village has around 101 students and each one has to speak English with their teachers, friends, and students throughout the day on January 1, 2019. While some are memorising simple rhymes, others are practising dance to Shakira's popular number 'Waka waka' (This Time For Africa).

This is a part of the 'English Empowerment Programme Fest' (EEPF) designed to improve knowledge of English among the students of government schools, said S. Mamatha, Deputy Director of Public Instruction, Mysuru district.

On New Year's day, the fest will be conducted in each of the 339 schools in the taluk, entirely in English -- from the prayer and dance, and action songs to the vote of thanks.

The EEPF is an ambitious project of the Education Department and it is being implemented on a pilot basis in all government schools in T. Narsipur taluk.

There are 26,000 students in the 339 government schools in the taluk. ""They are mainly from rural areas and they need a boost to improve their English. Hence, the department has selected T. Narsipur for the EEPF,"" Ms. Mamatha told The Hindu.

S. Swamy, Block Education Officer, said, ""We have already trained the teachers and cluster officer, and conducted meetings with the various teachers' associations. The motive behind the EEPF is to build confidence among the students to communicate in English.""

Though there is no official communication, the programme is being seen as a precursor to the State government's plan to introduce English medium in 1,000 government primary schools across the State.

The Education Department is thinking of extending the 'T. Narsipur model' across the State by training teachers through the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT) and the District Institutes of Education and Training (DIET), another senior officer said."

He said that this seems to be a punishment to the students and nobody from the education department is showing any concern to overcome the issue.

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

Chronicle Reporter, Bhopal, More than 52 thousand guest teachers have been arranged on the basis of their choice filling to ensure smooth running of educational activities in government schools in the academic session 2018-19 in the state.

The proceedings were postponed due to the completion of the proceedings of the first phase and the postponement given by the court. According to the order of the court, the school education department has taken necessary action.

Two development blocks and one district have been selected by the applicant at the time of choice filling. The applicants who have not participated in choice filling, considering the development block of the applicant's verification clause as the development block of the applicant's priority, a panel has been generated for the subject-post for each development block.

Applicants appearing in this panel are being sent state-level SMS for them to be present in the school till December 20 to send application. Applicants registered in gfms portal must submit their application portal generated by the score card.

Instructions for approval of the panel of applications received on December 27 at the school level have been given to the District Education Officers. Applications of the applicants, who are not registered in the gfms portal, can be received by the school till December 25. The entry of selected guest teachers has been asked to be completed by December 30 in the gfms portal.

Due to less number of applicants in the English panel in secondary and high school, permission has been given to keep applicants with higher qualifications in the English panel.

They will receive the honorarium of guest teachers. Apart from the Sanskrit panel, guest teachers will be placed in the schools with Urdu students, after the approval of the Urdu post apart in addition to Sanskrit as per nomination.

Similarly, due to the less number of postgraduate applicants in the agriculture faculty, graduates will be invited for the post of guest teachers. Candidates should have a Bachelor's degree with Mathematics or Physics or Engineering subjects for Mathematics subject.

He also described Kashmere Gate as an ""incubation centre"" for universities, saying it is a coincidence that several varsities, which were based in the area, are now moving to bigger campuses.

""We had launched the 'happiness curriculum' in government schools. Now we will launch the entrepreneurship curriculum from the next session onwards for secondary and senior secondary students.

""We need to instill confidence among our children in school right from the beginning of secondary education that after completing their education, they should aspire to be job givers and not job seekers,"" Sisodia said.

He explained that after at least 15 years of formal education, if a large number of the youth are not confident of creating something new, which can give them gainful return and add value to the economy, then as a society ""we are failing to nurture their full potential"".

Sisodia said, barring a few exceptions, once a child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary classes, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package.

This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful, he said.

""This trajectory is obsolete in today's day and age when new ideas and technologies are driving our way of life. If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" Sisodia said.

He said the entrepreneurship curriculum will be for students of classes 9 to 12 with the vision that every child should have the confidence of being creator rather than just being a consumer.

""The curriculum shall be based on a four-fold framework-- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self designed micro research, involve through local community and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects,"" said Sisodia, who also holds the education portfolio.

To take this idea forward, he has directed the secretary education to set up a high-powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, school principals and individuals having domain expertise as members.

""SCERT Delhi will organise a conference in January where it will invite organisations and individuals to present their ideas for the design of the entrepreneurship curriculum as per the framework of the government to a working group.

""Based on the inputs received, the pilot curriculum shall be rolled out from April 2019 onwards,"" Sisodia said.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

According to the education department, the Conrad Challenge -- an initiative by a US-based foundation run by the wife of NASA astronaut Charles Conrad, who flew in the second spacecraft to moon -- had invited students in the age group of 13 to 18 ""to create products or services that address some of the most pressing global challenges for the year 2018-19"".

It said they might have contacted the schools directly, warning the government institutes not to respond.

According to the Conrad Challenge website, however, the team registrations are ""closed for 2018-19"".

The DGSE order has an attached copy of the letter from Punjab health department issued in November by the director, Health Services.

According to the letter, PMI is behind the smoke-free world foundation and is part of the company's campaign to portray itself as solution to global tobacco epidemic.

The health department letters says that according to the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC), the main aim is to curb the industry's ""interference"" in the campaign.

DGSE Parshant Goyal told The Indian Express that they had also received an advisory from the MHRD, Government of India, apart from the letter from the health department. ""The MHRD had directed us to issue instructions to the schools to stay away from such competitions because such organisations contact the school directly without informing the education department authorities,"" said he, however, adding that no one from Conard Challenge has approached the department till date."

Out of the 162 schools in the zone, no school has been provided with electricity while as few schools are using 'temporary solar lighting systems'.

Imtiyaz Ahmad, a local from Markoot area of Gurez said, ""Almost 97 percent of government schools in this zone are without electricity and a few schools who have electricity use solar lights.""

He said that the solar lights are also used in the offices rather than in classrooms.

The locals said that the government schools including High School (HS) Kilshay, HS Gujran, HS Mallangam, Middle School (MS) Busgay and MS Mastan have a good roll of students but still very less attention is paid to the infrastructure of these schools.

Similarly, the Girls Middle School (GMS) Markoot, GMS Dawer, GMS Wanpora, Middle School (MS) Banjran, MS Dangan, Primary School (PS) Badoub, PS Marnoo, PS Mazgund, PS Nayal Higher Secondary School (HSS) Izmarg, HSS Bodagam, Boys Higher Secondary School (BHSS) Dawer and Higher Secondary School (GHSS) Dawer are also without electricity and boundary walls.

The information was revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Bandipora in a reply to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by RTI activist Raja Muzaffar Bhat in which he had sought information regarding the list of schools without electricity, Girls schools without toilets, boundary walls and drinking water facility.

Deputy Commissioner Bandipora, Shahid Iqbal Choudhary said, ""The electricity scenario of Gurez is entirely different from other areas of the Valley. There are total 5800 families to whom the district administration is providing electricity via generators run on diesel.""

Along with the refurbished school's inauguration on Thursday, a nationwide government school rejuvenation programme by The Akshaya Patra Foundation (TAPF) was also launched by the scion of Mysuru royal family Yaduveer Krishnadatta Chamaraja Wadiyar.

Titled 'School and Student Transformation - A Model School Initiative', the project aims to build 100 model schools pan India in the first phase and scale up to 500 in the second phase.

Elaborating on the project, TAPF CEO Shridhar Venkat said like GLPS Ravindranagar other schools will also be equipped with colouful and innovative compound walls, safe food storage facility, hand wash stations, zero maintenance bio-toilets and play area.

The model school initiative at GLPS Ravindranagar has been supported by Shyamala Prabhu and Kavita Shastry from the Institute of Indian Interior Designers and organisations such as Let's Endorse, Smile Charitable Trust, and The Aravani Art Project.

In a special interaction with Deccan Chronicle, Yaduveer said that infrastructural development of government schools was essential to help students benefit better from the system. Excerpts:

Experts point out offering better opportunities for students in government schools as well keeping the system of public education alive. How can this be done?

Going forward from initiatives like the School and Student Transformation model put forth by TAPF, encouraging children to grow up in a sustainable environment and ensuring they get access to experiential learning platforms is important. A transformation towards getting better in all ways - in terms of education, infrastructure and advanced learning prospects is essential for government schools to be more appealing to students and parents.

Do you believe beginning English medium classes or schools in the public education sector would improve government school enrolments and thereby quality of education offered as well?

Merely changing the medium to English would not improve the system at a larger scale. Even though learning English would help students get recognised as a global citizen, one cannot neglect the local language and culture and hence learning in Kannada is equally important. Knowledge in more languages right from the formative years is always good as it helps better brain development. However, a system to offer both Kannada and English mediums and either of them as a second language should be in place. The final call should be left open to each student/parent catering to their individual needs.

Will you prefer sending your son to a government school for education?

That will be a matter of practicality and we'll take a call depending on what is right for him at that point of time. He's just one year old now. I've seen several government schools that are very good and way better than their private counterparts with an enabled and progressive outlook. Good things take time and hopefully with such initiatives, government schools will retain its past glory. To be very honest, we haven't given this much thought as to how we should have already."

The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them.

He started using his mobile phone and tablet to teach students rhymes and realised that their interest levels increased sharply. Seeing Ravi's performance, a local MLA supported him with cash prize of Rs 1 lakh which he used to buy a projector and speakers etc.

Seeing its performance, the state government rewarded the school with a cash prize of ₹ 1.2 lakh in 2015-16. ""I used the money to buy audio video gadgets and transformed the school into a smart class. I started using the audio-visual mode of communication to teach other subjects as well. The attendance began improving. Now there are 325 students in the school. Today, the students don't want to miss any class,"" he said.

This is not the lone example.

Alpa Nigam, headmaster of a school in Gorakhpur, said when she joined in 2010, very few students were enrolled and most of them ran away after lunch time. To catch their interest, Alpa too started using a mobile phone and speakers.

Impressed with her dedication, Rotary Club and other well-wishers donated a projector, which is being used to screen educational movies for students. Now the school has three laptops and learning is fun here.

Sushil Singh, principal of primary school Gulriha in Harak block of Barabanki district said, ""We had received ₹1.2 lakh from the state government as part of an excellence award. We used the prize money to buy a projector, speakers and an inverter and started smart classes. The results have been encouraging. We hope other schools will follow our model instead of waiting for government assistance.""

The number of government schools in Uttar Pradesh running smart classes had been slowly but steadily growing, said a basic education department official. He said this was largely due to efforts of individual teachers who were seeking help from good Samaritans or opting for crowd funding to arrange the money needed to digitize the teaching process.

At a time when the state government is still to make any budgetary provision for running smart classes in schools, these teachers are doing their best to equip their institutions with the latest technologies and compete with private institutions mushrooming in small districts.

Now the basic education department is preparing a database of all such schools.

""The findings, so far, have come as a surprise. Nearly 1,200 schools (out of the total 1.54 lakh in the state) are running smart classes,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh. He said it was equally surprising that the state capital was yet to catch up with other districts in this respect.

He said that most of these institutions were concentrated in far off districts like Gorakhpur or smaller ones such as Hardoi and Sitapur.

""Gorakhpur has the maximum number (124) of smart class schools. Hardoi is a close second with 122 schools, and Sitapur is next with 120. Some of the other districts with such schools are Azamgarh (33), Mau (28), Muzaffarnagar (20), Bulandshahr (18), Lalitpur (17), Kaushambhi (15) and Jaunpur (10),"" he said.

Singh said that by integrating technology with education, these schools had transformed the teaching-learning process, making it far more interesting.

""It has helped a lot in increasing student retention. For instance, now a science teacher doesn't just talk about blood circulation but actually shows the students how blood is circulated in the body via arteries and veins,"" he said.

The official said that soon these teachers would be invited to the state capital where they would interact with other government school teachers, inspiring them to generate resources to make their respective schools more appealing for students.

""Some of the teachers who have done good work will also be felicitated,"" Singh said."

This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it.

Chatting about the upcoming examination and reciting multiplication tables, they are getting ready for another day at the Government Senior Secondary School here.

From the outside, there's nothing extraordinary about the scene but as you enter, a pleasant surprise awaits.

Neatly furnished classrooms, a library and lab form part of an encouraging attempt to give these children quality education infrastructure, all thanks to an experiment by Brahm Prakash Shastri, a former principal of the school.

By bypassing administrative procedures and seeking help directly from NGOs, and tapping various corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives, Shastri's endeavours have ended up benefiting teachers as well as some 20 government schools in the district. And it's the power of community, he believes, which has helped turn his simple idea into gold, in the space of four years.

As a rule, to channel CSR funds, corporates and NGOs must approach the education department but this is a process that can, and often does, take a long time. ""And all the donations don't necessarily reach us,"" admits Shastri, who eventually sought the assistance of the big companies, with due approval from the education department. Now, the govt school in Basai has an impressive science and computer lab, an RO water purifier for clean drinking water, refurbished toilets, a diesel genset and split air-conditioners, besides well-furnished classes and staff rooms. Behind all this is teamwork.

Villagers, for example, have contributed by whitewashing the walls. ""Several local NGOs approached us for basic things, like installing RO and donating books. We then asked the companies to invest directly and they have helped (with) the entrance, walking tracks and boundary walls,"" Shastri adds.

According to a notification under Section 135 of The Companies Act 2013, it is compulsory for companies with a net worth of Rs 500 crore or more, turnover of Rs 1,000 crore or more, or net profit of Rs 5 crore or more, in any given financial year, to spend two percent of their net profit on CSR programmes.

And following the successful Basai model, government schools in Carterpuri, Jacobpura, Tikri, Shakurpur, Bhondsi and Tikli (and one in Sarsa, Bhiwani), have undergone renovation. The Tikri school, TOI found, is getting a new washroom for boys, girls and handicapped children (courtesy a North American real estate firm). Tulsiram, the principal here, happily acknowledges the transformation. ""Our school was initially in a very bad condition - there was no sewer connection and the boundary wall was in a dilapidated state,"" he recalls, sitting in his office-cum-staff room. ""We are not aware of the expenditure, but this CSR activity has brought a positive change in the school.""

Indeed, in two years, CSR funds have ensured that the Tikri govt school is not lacking when it comes to the bare essentials, among them a water tank, utensils for midday meals, a level playground and washrooms.

Dinesh Shastri, the district education officer, has visited 20 such schools across the state and claims that facilities are on a par with those in private schools. ""The drop-out rate has come down heavily too,"" he says.

However, for all the progress in infrastructure development, there are still more than 30,000 vacancies for teachers in the state. The data report card of the District Information System for Education (U-DISE) corroborates this fact, pointing out the acute shortage of teachers and principals in Haryana.

Still, with over 540 government schools in the district, there is no dearth of corporate majors who are prepared to come forward and do their bit towards make the learning ecosystem more welcoming and fun for children."

Mere rain or drizzle should not be taken as a cause for declaring holidays, it said.

Directing the collectors to exercise extra caution in declaring school holidays, school education secretary Pradeep Yadav has issued a series of guidelines to protect the interest of students.

This comes after the government noticed that the district collectors resorted to declaring holidays even on a normal rainy day ""without realising that it disturbs the entire lesson plan for teaching and learning.""

""The decision to close schools may be taken three hours before the opening of schools, taking into account the situation prevailing at that time,"" Yadav said.

The chief educational officers shall assess the gravity of the situation and suggest the area and day for declaring the holiday to the district collector.

Holiday may be restricted to the affected areas only. Revenue district need not be the unit of declaration of holiday, while educational district, block or any other local body could even be the unit for declaring holiday, Yadav said.

The official said the announcement for declaring holiday on other accounts such as local temple festivals should also contain the day on which compensatory classes would be held.

Each holiday declared in any area should be duly compensated by opening schools in that area on Saturdays so that schools do not miss any lesson planned for the day of holiday.

""Efforts should be made to open schools at the earliest,"" Yadav said. Camps, if any, should be shifted to other facilities available in the vicinity. Pumping out of water in case of water logging and cleaning of premises should be given the utmost priority in the scheme of relief and rehabilitation.

In Tamil Nadu, the holidays to schools are declared in a routine manner on the previous day itself on mere warnings of cyclone, irrespective of intensity. It has been noticed that on the days of holiday due to rain, there is bright sunshine.

The government schools are normally the first target for selecting as relief centres without even exploring other facilities such as community halls, service centres, cyclone shelters in the vicinity.

The studies of students studying particularly in government schools are adversely affected, Yadav said. There is also a predetermined schedule of tests and examinations, which gets derailed due to declaration of too many holidays."

Meanwhile with the government announcing winter vacations, students of these government schools were in a dilemma as they have not received their textbooks yet from the school authorities.

The annual examinations in government primary and middle schools culminated last month but the promoted students have not been provided with various textbooks by School Education Department (SED).

The teachers in various government-run-schools said that there is a non-availability of mathematics, history and geography books for the 9th standard and mathematics, Science in 10th standard also.

The teachers also said that the students from 5th to 8th standard are also without mathematics, history and civics textbooks.

Official sources in SED said that the Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) was probably supposed to order 50 lakh textbooks but this year the department ordered these books late.

""However the board have received some of the books but few books are yet to be received and the School Education Department,"" he said.

""SED has given a deadline to the JKBOSE for availing the pending books of various classes till December 05, sources said adding, ""The school authorities have been also asked to distribute the pending books on 15th of December to all respective students.""

He said that the JKBOSE was also directed to provide books and stationery to the school authorities of Ladakh district first because of the road closure issues.

Lamenting on the non-availability of various books in Srinagar district he said there is a huge non-availability of various books from Ist to 10th standard in the district.

Chairman, JKBOSE, Veena Pandita said, ""We have science books available but mathematics and Urdu books are pending for two classes."" ""Actually the trucks carrying the books are stuck somewhere in the highway. But in coming two days we are hopeful, we will receive these books too,"" she assured. She said that for the rest of the classes there was no shortage or non-availability of any book.

This is where the contribution of NGOs like Reachout India and organisations like Rotary and Lions become important as they can provide basic facilities like libraries, toilets, books and desks to run such schools, which are starved of funds, he said.

The sense of dismay was visible on the face of the officer, who is also in-charge of the swimming course conducted by the government, while leading the search operations to recover the bodies of two siblings from Karamana river on Tuesday/Wednesday.

""People are yet to realise the importance of teaching their children how to swim. Many drowning deaths could have been avoided. Government schools are not paying heed despite repeated requests,"" he said. Kumar is inching towards the fag end of his career and in the past one year alone he had attended more than ten similar cases of drowning.

Jalaraksha is a government project aimed at imparting free swimming lessons to students of government schools. The government also provides funds for free refreshments, including milk, egg and bread, to students enrolled under this scheme. Schools can approach local fire stations to avail the scheme. Private individuals can also avail the training here, but, only by paying fee.

It was in 2016 that the pool was constructed at Nedumcaud by local administration as a permanent facility for the scheme. ""It was more than two months ago that the last batch of students completed training here.

""But, we hardly get any applications,"" said Rasheed said adding that major share of fund allotted by the government to buy refreshments for the students was yet to be spent.

For most part of the 14 years of his life, Priyanshu Singh, a class 9 student of Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Yamuna Vihar, had no clue why his female friends complain about mood swings and abdominal pain for a day or two every month. Whenever the girls declined to participate in sports activities, he would mock and even crack jokes at their expense.

But all of that changed this September.

That was when Singh understood that it happens when the girls are either going through premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or on their monthly period cycle. ""While I knew what periods are, I was unaware about the difficulties women face when they are on their natural cycle. I used to laugh at my friends when they would complain about stomachache and mood swings. Now, I understand that mood swings are because of the PMS and it's normal to have stomach pain while they are on their periods,"" he said.

The change in mindset and the awareness was only possible because the school organised a workshop on 'menstrual awareness' in collaboration with non-governmental organisation (NGO) Sachhi Saheli. ""It was overwhelming to see the students, especially boys, asking menstruation-related queries with so much confidence. At the end of the workshop, the boys distributed packets of sanitary napkins among girls without any hesitation and pledged to make the campus period-friendly,"" RP Singh, principal of the school, said.

Now, the school is planning to organise a workshop for parents as well. ""Most of these students come from families where such discussions are prohibited. We are planning to organise a workshop for parents to sensitise them and encourage them to discuss these topics with their children,"" he said.

But their school is not an exception.

As many as 30 co-educational government schools have approached the NGO this year to organise workshops in order to sensitise students about menstruation. Till July this year, the NGO was conducting these workshops only in all girls' schools. ""We wanted to impart basic education about menstruation to students studying in government schools. We had contacted the Directorate of Education (DoE) last year and briefed them about our plan. The DoE gave us permission to conduct these workshops in girls' schools running under the Delhi government and the civic bodies. But, this year we started receiving requests from co-ed schools as well. We have already covered around 10 co-ed schools in the last four months and it has turned out to be a wonderful experience,"" said Dr Surbhi Singh, a gynecologist and founder of Sachhi Saheli.

During the workshops, the students are told about the science behind menstruation and the myths surrounding it. The girls are also taught basic hygiene that should be maintained during periods. ""We do not discuss about menstruation with boys at home or school and still expect them to be sensitive and supportive. It's very important to remove stigmas and taboos attached to periods from their minds. That's why we show them sanitary napkins and explain the importance of their use. We also tell boys about the physical and mental strains girls go though during their menstrual cycle,"" Singh said.

At another co-ed school in Nanakpura, a class 10 student Sagar Malik said he gifted his mother a pack of sanitary pads after attending the workshop. ""I had come to know about the issues women face in case they use cloth instead of sanitary pads during their periods. I requested the teacher in charge at my school to give a packet for my mother because I did not know what she uses. I have never heard anything about menstruation at home. When I gave her the packet, she looked shocked. But when I told her what I had learnt at school, she looked happy and relieved. She even called me a Padman,"" the 14-year-old said.

Meanwhile, a group of boys at a government co-ed school in Vasant Kunj has pledged to educate people in their localities about ""menstrual health"". ""We have decided to go from door to door in our localities and tell people the importance of maintaining hygiene during periods to avoid infections,"" said Lalit Singh, one of the students.

Girls, too, are happy with the change.

Divya Singh, a class 9 student at a school in Janakpuri, said she used to bring a 'black polythene bag' to carry the packet of sanitary napkins the school distributes under the Centre's Kishori Shakti Yojna. The girls in her school would collect their packets from the medical room after classes got over. Under the Kishori Shakti Yojna, girl students, between the ages of 11 and 18, are distributed a sanitary napkin packet every month in government schools across the country.

However, Singh and her classmates have now asked the teacher to distribute the pack of sanitary napkins in the classrooms. ""We had never uttered the word period in the presence of our male classmates before. It was the first time when a group, having more boys than girls, was sitting and discussing the myths and taboos attached to menstruation. Things have comparatively changed. Now, we do not have to think hundred times before talking about periods in school at least like we have to do at home,"" she said.

According to a survey published in Journal of Family and Community Medicine (JFCM) in September, 40% girls remained absent from school during their menstruation for reasons such as lack of privacy at school, source of information on menstruation and anxiety about leakage, and staining of their uniform. The survey was conducted on 600 girls studying in government schools in Delhi.

Experts say it's important to impart basic knowledge about menstruation at schools. ""It's important to make both make both genders aware of the science behind menstruation. While for girls, good menstrual hygiene can help prevent any kind of pelvic inflammatory diseases and infections, such talk sessions are equally important for boys to remove all the taboos and preconceived notions about periods. They should understand that it's a part of a girls' life and absolutely normal,"" said Dr Anuradha Kapur, a senior gynecologist at Max hospital in Saket.

Sanjay Goel, director of the DoE, said the government will encourage more co-ed schools to come forward and organise such workshops."

2. In Thiruvarur and Nagapattinam, Villagers Angry with Govt Response After Gaja

Anger simmers in the villages of Tiruvarur and Nagapattinam districts. It has been five days since Cyclone Gaja reduced their homes to rubble. A sea of discontentment is all that remains for the people in Thalayamangalam in Tiruvarur and Vizhanthamavadi in Nagapattinam districts. Despite the TN Chief Minister's claims that relief works started hours after the cyclone made landfall, people in these two villages deny it completely.

Villagers are involved in protests across the districts in the past two days alleging that no relief has come from the government's side for them. ""We (common men) immediately pitched in money and bought power saws to cut the trees. The trees in Rajagopalapuram village were cleared by the villagers after a lot of struggle. Even now there are a lot of trees fallen here,"" one said.

3. Jayalalithaa's Pet Project on Solar Energy Falls Behind Target

Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's pet scheme to promote solar energy in households through a subsidy scheme has been left languishing in cold storage since her death in 2016. She had announced the 'Capital Incentive Scheme' to promote solar energy among domestic consumers by giving a capital subsidy of ₹20,000 per kilo watt (KW) for grid-connected photo voltaic systems in the State.

She had also set a target of 10,000 domestic consumers as per the Government Order of the Energy Department, dated October 18, 2013. However, since the launch of the programme, the State has not been able to reach even the half-way mark of 5,000.

4. 32-Year-Old Man Murdered in TN, Police Probe If It Is a Case of Hate Killing

32-year-old Esakki Shankar body was sprawled on wild foliage, deep cuts visible on his hand and his chest. A fatal knife wound on his neck police believe was the likely cause of his death. Shankar's body was found at around 7.30 am on Tuesday at the banks of the Thamarbharani river which flows near his home at Vellanguli in Tirunelveli district. Shankar was murdered when he went to take a bath at the river.

But over a day after he was hacked to death, Deputy Superintendent of Police, who conducted the preliminary investigation says that they have established neither the motive for the murder nor zeroed in on possible suspects. An investigating official in his team however on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were looking into two possible motives, one of which is a hate crime.

The police raided 21 shops that were found selling second-hand mobile phones without proper bills near the Moore Market Complex on Tuesday. A total of 794 phones were seized.

According to the Tamil Nadu Scrap Merchant and Dealers in Second Hand Property and Owner of Auto-mobile Workshop and Tinkering Shop (Regulations Control and Licensing) Act 1985, the shop owners should have proof pertaining to when and from whom they purchased the equipment. ""However, most of the roadside shops selling the second-hand mobile phones do not have any proof and they do not produce any bill on purchase of the equipment. We suspect that stolen mobile phones can flood these shops,"" said a senior police officer.

6. 187 Buses Shifted from CMBT to KK Nagar Depot

A month after shifting Andhra Pradesh bound buses to the newly developed Madhavaram Mofussil bus terminus (MMBT), the Transport department has shifted buses operating to Puducherry, Cuddalore and Chidambaram from Koyambedu bus terminus to K K Nagar MTC depot. The move aimed at decongesting the Dr MGR bus terminus in Koyambedu and Inner Ring road, is expected to bring down travel time by 30 minutes.

Some 167 buses run by Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation (Villupuram) and 20 buses of Puducherry Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) have been shifted to K K Nagar MTC depot, two weeks ago. The decision was also attributed to the frequent accidents at Ashok pillar junction by official sources.

About two dozen schools from Vidarbha, receiving full or partial grant-in-aid from the exchequer, challenged the amendment made by government in Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of Service) Regulation Rules, 1981, by introducing online recruitment system through its 'Pavitra' portal and also to make appointments through eligibility/aptitude test conducted by it.

A notification was issued in this regard on June 22 last year while Tawde had declared to fill up over 18,000 teachers posts in aided schools through 'Pavitra' portal, during assembly session, here on July 9. He justified the move asserting that it would ensure total transparency and end any chances of corruption. Earlier, there were several complaints that the school managements used to charge in lakhs for single appointment.

""The procedure for teachers' selection and appointment in private schools should be governed by MEPS' Rule 6(1), (2) and (3) read with Rule 9 (2A) and (2B), without interfering with right of the management/committee to select and appoint qualified, eligible and suitable candidates by holding interviews,"" a division bench comprising justices Ravi Deshpande and Vinay Joshi ruled, while partly allowing the bunch of petitions.

The petitioners though counsels Bhanudas Kulkarni and Ravindra Khapre -- had termed amendment as violation of their fundamental right to carry on the occupation of education, as guaranteed by Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution of India. It encroaches upon their autonomy and privilege to select and appoint the teachers. They also challenged government resolution (GR) of June 23 last year, which binds the management to make appointments as per merit list of candidates, who cleared the eligibility/aptitude test.

The bench observed that Rule 9 (2B) of the MEPS Rules, retains power with school management/committee to select the teachers of its choice among the qualified candidates. ""We reject the state's argument that Rule 9 (2B) has to be interpreted in such a fashion so as to mandate the management/committee to appoint teachers strictly as per the merit list of those clearing eligibility/aptitude test conducted by centre/state without judging comparative merits and suitability to select the candidates on the basis of oral interview.""

The judges added that the school committee retains its powers under Rule 9 (2B) to conduct oral interview of candidates, and appoint a suitable one. ""We, however, make it clear that to maintain transparency, each member of the management/committee will have to mandatorily record reasons in brief for deviating from the order of merit shown in the list of successful candidates in the eligibility/aptitude test. The decision of majority will prevail in the matter of selection and appointment of teachers.""

They added that if government's interpretation was accepted, they have to strike down provision of Rule 9 (2B), to the extent it deprives right of the management to select and appoint teachers on grounds that it suffers from incompetence, makes right to appoint illusory, and violates fundamental rights of management.

Pavitra app was bound to fail, says Ganar

The setback at the HC for government over its Pavitra app has not surprised MLC Nago Ganar, who says it was 'bound to fail'.

Ganar, who represents the teachers constituency, said the government should have simply made an amendment in the act that regulates the hiring. ""The act says that management has the right of appointment, so unless that is modified by the legislature things will not change. It was a step in the right direction to end corruption, but the route the government chose was incorrect,"" said Ganar."

When Shobha Suryanarayan, a volunteer with Acharyas for a Better Community (ABC), first approached Vijayanagar Lower Primary School in Whitefield, the students could barely string together a sentence in English. The school had over 50 children from classes 1 to 5, but there was only one teacher and a headmistress (HM) to teach all of them. Children in classes 1, 2 and 3 would sit together; they were taught by the HM once she finished her official work. Children in classes 4 and 5 would sit together, and were taught by the other teacher, says Shobha.

ABC, an NGO based in Bengaluru, is driven by volunteers who go to teach in government schools. They also get CSR funding to meet each school's individual requirements.

At Vijayanagar school, the teachers asked ABC to take over English classes. In last November, ABC appointed a full-time teacher in the school, whose salary is paid with CSR funds. Within just three months, there was a huge difference, says Shobha. ""The students spoke in English, and even performed a skit in English. When I first had gone in, they had no idea about sentence structure,"" she says. ABC also appointed a janitor since students themselves used to clean the school, including its toilets, up till then.

ABC is also refurbishing the school, and setting up a peer lab and library there, with CSR funds. ""We have built a dining area and washing area for the kids. The ground has been levelled and cleaned up so that children have a safe place to play. We also raised the compound wall and put up barbed fencing to prevent anti-social activities that used to be common in the school premises at night,"" says Shobha. CSR funds also cover students' breakfast, which has resulted in both higher attendance rates and better attention span among students. Overall ABC has got Rs 40 lakhs as CSR funds for Vijayanagar School.

In Pattandur Agrahara School behind ITPL, the student enrolment went up from less than 10, to 96 now. The school which was in threat of being shut down, was rebuilt by ABC. ABC's volunteers also teach in the school. The school's transformation has most benefited children from the migrant construction labourer community who live nearby. Similar was the case with Nallurhalli Government Primary School.

ABC is one among the many volunteer-driven initiatives in the city that's changing government schools, one at a time. In addition to registered trusts like ABC, there are also informal volunteering groups, like one led by Anupama Harish in Malleswaram.

The shortage of competent teachers in government schools, lack of functional infrastructure, and difficult familial circumstances are causing many students to perform poorly in schools or to drop out altogether. Many low-income families also spend a large part of their income to send their children to private schools, in hope of better education, especially in English. However, studies show that low-income private schools are hardly any better than government schools in terms of learning outcomes. It's in this scenario that volunteer interventions are strengthening the public school system in Bengaluru.

Many volunteering organisations start off without much of a plan.

Malleswaram volunteers had come together when local resident Anupama Harish proposed her idea of volunteering in the 'Malleswaram & Suttha Muttha' Facebook group. Of nearly 12,000 members in the group then, many responded. Since 2015-16, Anupama's team has been teaching Mathematics in the Malleswaram 18th Cross Boys' High School.

The group has three volunteer-teachers for Maths each in 8th, 9th and 10th standards. Each teacher picks a favourite topic in Maths to teach - algebra, geometry etc. At any time, the group has 10-15 volunteers.

The school initially asked Anupama to get the permission of the Block Education Officer (BEO). The BEO was happy to have volunteer-teachers since the school had teacher shortage, especially in Maths. Maths was also the subject in which majority of the 10th standard students had failed in the previous year, in board exams.

After discussions with the school's head teacher, the group got a timetable. From this year, they have also been teaching Social Studies here. The team has developed a structured syllabus. They also update their progress in a common document so that there is no overlap in what's taught.

Having a structured syllabus is important since volunteers may otherwise teach random topics, concurs Jayashree Narayanan, who was a teacher-volunteer with the NGO OBLF (One Billion Literates Foundation). Jayashree, by her own initiative, had approached Kaikondrahalli Government School a few years back, interested in being a volunteer-teacher. She then became part of OBLF, which signed MoUs with the schools to allow its volunteer-teachers there.

Jayashree then found interested volunteers through her personal networks. OBLF volunteers have worked with five schools in Sarjapur Road area so far, but the volunteering has been stalled for this year because of the lack of committed volunteers. Jayashree plans to resume the programme next year.

OBLF volunteers start off the academic year by assessing students on spoken and written English. ""So we know where the kids stand, and we teach them from that level. We give another assessment at the end of the year to see how far the kids have progressed,"" says Jayashree. The team gets only a one-hour slot in a day. Usually there are two volunteers teaching English in each grade - one teachers three hours and the other two hours per week, so that there is continuity. Jayashree says schools have been open to them since they come from a registered NGO, with proper permissions.

ABC had started informally in 2016, as a group of 10-15 people. They initially had difficulty getting CSR funds, but this changed with their success in Pattandur Agrahara School. In late 2017, ABC registered as a Trust since corporates would fund only formal entities. Currently the NGO is a loosely structured organisation with a CSR group, operations group, social media group etc, all driven by volunteers. The organisation has about 50 volunteers in the city, and has worked with around 20 schools so far.

ABC starts engaging with a school by holding sports or art events, or by donating school bags etc to the students. During events, the team identifies the requirements of the school by talking to teachers and students. ""When we hold an event, they understand that we are serious. We list down requirements and create a proper project for the school,"" says Vikas Chandra, co-founder of ABC.

The requirements are put up on ABC's Facebook page, where people interested in volunteering or donating respond. The NGO also approaches corporates for CSR funds to do building repairs, set up new infrastructure, appoint teachers, distribute bags to students etc. It takes a good deal of time and effort to get CSR funds approved, says Chandra.

Volunteers say that working with high school or PUC students is more difficult as they often lack basic knowledge in subjects. Brijesh of the Malleswaram group says teaching 10th standard students was an uphill task. ""They didn't even know basic maths such as addition and subtraction. But we made sure that students who would come to 10th standard from 8th and 9th standards would get the basics right,"" he says.

Working with primary school students is more fruitful than working with high school or PUC students, opine volunteers. Younger children are more receptive to learning, and can get a good foundation at the appropriate age, they say. ""We want to enter the primary school sector now. If we strengthen the basics of primary school children, teaching high school students will become easier for our own volunteers,"" says Anupama.

Many students also come from very unstable backgrounds, such as abusive/alcoholic fathers, along with socio-economic backwardness or migrant nature of parents jobs. They need to be motivated to study, say volunteers. Schools get very little amounts for annual maintenance, and hence lack essential stationery materials and staff. In some schools, toilets are locked up or students are made to clean those due to the lack of cleaning staff. ""In a class of 30-40 students, only 10-15 would really want to learn. The other children don't even want to come to school,"" says Jayashree.

Coordinating between volunteers and schools is a challenge for volunteering organisations. Volunteers come from varying backgrounds, but most are homemakers or working professionals. While homemakers are available to volunteer on weekdays, coordinating with professionals on their time slots at the school can be a challenge. Negotiating with the school to get good time slots for teaching, having the school not cancel a time slot randomly, and having committed volunteers who go to the school regularly, are all challenges. Most volunteer organisations ask its members to commit to teaching in a school for at least a year.

The volunteering system acts as a self-sustaining system, where the interested, committed volunteers stay on their own. Volunteering groups say that most volunteers who stay on are well-qualified and passionate about teaching.

However, finding committed volunteers who are fluent in both English and Kannada has been difficult in Sarjapur Road area, says Jayashree. ""Many volunteers, once they start teaching, realise that not knowing Kannada is a barrier in reaching out to primary school children, since these children are very young.""

Some volunteers at ABC circumvented this problem by taking a six-month course in Kannada to learn the basics. ""This leads to a reverse teaching process in the class. Students love that they can teach Kannada to volunteers,"" says Shobha. Sometimes, if a student in the class knows Hindi, the child will act as a translator between the Hindi-speaking volunteer and other students.

Gaining entry into a school in the first place can be difficult as well. ""We struggle with regulatory challenges - BEO permissions, HMs not wanting to cooperate etc. For teachers, it is judgement on their work when we go in. So there is a lot of resistance. Sometimes we bulldoze our way through. But sometimes we find very cooperative and committed teachers,"" says Shobha. However, once the volunteers bring about good results, schools are only too happy to have them continue, say volunteers.

While volunteers pitching in with teaching, infrastructure support and funds is impactful for that specific school, it is not an institutionalised solution, and hard to sustain in the long run. Systemic changes to the education system need more thought out interventions and reforms, which we shall explore in subsequent stories."

He added that the SMC fund can be used to hire resource persons or experts for subjects and co-curricular activities. Mr. Sisodia said heads of schools who are able to utilise the funds well would be rewarded while those do ""indulge in wrong practices will be punished"", the statement said.

Speaking about the happiness curriculum, which was introduced earlier this year, Mr. Sisodia asked heads of schools to emphasise the programme that focuses on teaching mindfulness to students.

""Mindfulness is the most important element of the happiness curriculum. We have to make our children attentive instead of asking them to practice meditation. In case we succeed in inculcating the habit of being attentiveness in our children, they will do well throughout their lives,"" he said."

The guardians of students at the three schools -- in Ashok Vihar, Dwarka Sector 22 and Dwarka Sector 16B -- operating under the banner of Presidium, which runs eight other schools across Delhi's satellite cities, were informed through circulars that the schools were dissociating from the name 'Presidium' and changing to 'Prudence'. The circulars were signed by G S Matharoo, who was a part of the management team of Presidium group in the role of Advisor. In the circulars, his designation read 'Chairman of Prudence'.

The circular stated that the decision to dissociate from Presidium was due to its ""change in emphasis"" from ""an academically oriented, student-centric academic institution to a profit-centric institution"".

""The three schools are run by three different societies which are their governing bodies, and Presidium was only a brand they associated with. In July or August, Presidium placed a demand that the schools pay 20 per cent of their total collections in order to continue using the franchisee name. The governing bodies of all three schools passed unanimous resolutions rejecting this and they will now be operating under the new brand Prudence. Apart from the name, the entire management body remains as it was. It is the prerogative of a governing body to change the school's name,"" Matharoo told The Indian Express.

However, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia said that while a school cannot be forced to be a part of any franchise, the change has to receive government approval. ""A complaint from parents regarding this matter was received on Monday, and no prior intimation or application was received for the change,"" he said.

The circular was followed by a message by Presidium chairperson Sudha Gupta, circulated on social media, calling the change ""an act of fraud"" and ""sabotage"". Gupta added that ""to the best of my understanding, the change in name has not been done in accordance with the law"". Another circular by Matharoo followed, accusing Presidium of misappropriation of funds. Multiple attempts by The Indian Express to contact Gupta went answered. The founder of Mother's Pride, a chain of playschools, she is married to former MCD executive engineer Devinder Gupta.

Meanwhile, parents also objected to the change: ""We suddenly get to know our children are studying in a school with an unknown name,"" said Amit Kharkhari, whose children study in the Dwarka Sector 22 school.

The Presidium website markets joining the group as a franchisee as a ""smart business decision"", the requirements for which are land area, cost of construction, working capital for the initial years, and a franchisee fee comprising a licence fee and a percentage of revenue. In return for this, the franchisee is promised the ""backing of, and association with, a respected brand in education"" and ""full support in recruitment, training staff and marketing"", the agreement for which lasts 45 years."

""We have to take into consideration the wishes of the parents how they feel comfortable. The sale of the books at one place only makes things easier for the parents.""

""All the zonal education officers have been asked to conduct surprise visits to schools under their jurisdiction and all HoS directed to prepare modules for mock tests and extra classes for students set to take the board-level exams. The HoS are also going to sit in the classes where a large number of students failed. We are expecting to improve the results in the pre-board exams, to be held in December,"" Goel said.

Last year, only 31% students passed the class 10 pre-board exams, following which the DoE issued show-cause notices to as many as 120 schools. The results, however, improved to 69.32 % in the board exams."

Currently, the reimbursement in Maharashtra is approximately Rs 17,000 per year per child, but some school owners say that it is very less as compared to their original fee structure.

A school trustee in Nagpur said that only budget schools would charge lower but very few people line up for admissions in such schools.

""CBSE-affiliated schools are mostly in demand followed by state's English medium schools. The cheapest CBSE school in Nagpur would charge around Rs 25,000 annually but the average cost would be nearer to Rs 35,000. This means the government's reimbursement is half of what schools are charging to non-RTE students,"" said the trustee.

These are some of the issues the school owners will be discussing in December when they meet for a state-level conference in Chandrapur. TOI had reported about the latest RTE guidelines and how schools expressed unhappiness over the government's increasing paperwork.

While western Maharashtra-based trustee associations' leaders spoke openly against the government policies, local members preferred to remain anonymous. ""The government is putting its responsibilities on us. We have been asked to reserve 25% seats and we don't have any problem with that, but it should make financial sense. To raise revenue, the remaining 75% students will have to bear the cost through fee hike,"" said another school trustee."
