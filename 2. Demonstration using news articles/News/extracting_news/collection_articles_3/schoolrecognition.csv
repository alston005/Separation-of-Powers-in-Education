The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported. These include Bal Bharati School in Dwarka, St Marks Senior Secondary School in Meera Bagh, and Springdales, Dhaula Kuan."

""Once we receive the notice, we will take the appropriate legal remedy and we have full faith in the legal system,"" he added.

Keeping the students' interest in mind, the withdrawal of recognition would take effect on April 1, 2019, the order said, adding that no new admissions should be made in the meantime.

The school had argued that it had not been given land by the Delhi Development Authority on concessional rates, so the Delhi High Court judgment that gives the DoE the power to regulate fees of such schools was not applicable to it, the order said.

The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

In response to the number of complaints of fee hike of 8 percent by the parents of the students, Joint Director School Education through a letter here to the Chairman of the school sought his personal appearance in view of the complaints by the parents that they were denied the copies of the annual charges and the fee which was fixed by the Fee Fixation Committee.

The order by the Joint Director Education noted that chairman of the school should present himself at the office of the department in Srinagar on Wednesday and warned of strict action against the school in case he fails to attend the hearing. Besides the chairman, parents association of the school has also been asked to reach the department on Wednesday.

The order said that a delegation of parents of students at Hat Trick school had approached the department ""with regard to redressal of their genuine grievances"".

A delegation of parents had met the school authorities at the DESK and brought to their notice the violation of rules in denying them the information about the fee and annual charges which have been approved by the authorities. The notice by the Education department to the school came also in the wake of the complaints that the school was forcing the parents to buy the books from a particular shop to indulge in profiteering.

A Chinese high school is using facial recognition technology to monitor and analyze students' behaviour.

The technology scans classrooms at Hangzhou No. 11 High School every 30 seconds and records students' facial expressions, categorizing them into happy, angry, fearful, confused or upset. The system also records student actions such as writing, reading, raising a hand, and sleeping at a desk.

The school's vice principal said students' privacy is protected because the technology doesn't save actual images from the classroom and stores data on a local server rather than the cloud.

Last year Chinese company Qihoo 360 shut down hundreds of its surveillance livestreaming channels after an uptick in privacy concerns. The channels streamed camera footage from several public locations including swimming pools, restaurants, and classrooms - the latter protected only by a password.

But security systems are rising in popularity after an increase in violence and questionable practices at Chinese kindergartens. In Beijing, all kindergartens are now required to have surveillance systems, some of which are even connected to local police monitoring systems.

The use of facial-recognition technology is soaring in China, where it is being used to increase efficiency and improve policing. Cameras are used to catch jaywalkers, find fugitives, track people's regular hangouts, and even predict crime before it happens."

Now, there's a new target in Big Brother's crosshairs, and that's China's kids.

According to government run website Hangzhou.com, a school in the city has taken to facial recognition to keep students attentive in class. Three cameras have supposedly been installed above a blackboard at Hangzhou Number 11 High School in eastern China. The facial recognition system captures seven expressions, neutral, happy, sad, disappointed, angry, scared and surprised. It then uses these to determine whether each child is paying attention to the lesson, and feeds the data back to the teacher if they're not.

So far the system has been installed in just one classroom, but it's expected to be used by the entire school within a few months. ""Previously when I had classes that I didn't like very much, I would be lazy and maybe take a nap on the desk or flick through other textbooks,"" one student told Hangzhou.com. ""But I don't dare be distracted since the cameras were installed in the classrooms. It's like a pair of mystery eyes are constantly watching me.""

Obviously, the system has met with criticism from some groups, but the school principal said he believes it'll improve the standard of education being provided. ""It's the same as teachers having an assistant, and it can improve the quality of teaching,"" he said. """"Some have said it can infringe the privacy of students, but it only records students' movements, rather than filming activities in class.""

Worryingly though, he let on a rudimentary system of classification the system has, marking attentive students with an 'A' and others with a 'B'. It's probably only a matter of time before that system is used to segregate students into attentive and distracted classes, with those unable to keep up likely being saddled with extra study hours and the like."

(File)

The Directorate of Education (DoE) has withdrawn recognition of an east Delhi school for allegedly indulging in forgery and issuing school leaving certificates (SLCs) to students of two other schools that have recognition only till Class V.

DoE officials said St Gee Varghese Public School in Kalyanvas was allegedly issuing SLCs to students studying in classes VI-VIII of two schools -- Mother Marry Public School in Mandawali, and New Indraprastha Public School, East Vinod Nagar. Officials said both schools, recognised only up to Class V by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, have been illegally running classes up to Class X.

School authorities could not be reached for comment on the matter. The DoE has withdrawn recognition -- granted in 1989-90 -- from this academic session and has advised parents not to approach the school for admissions. The action was taken by the department following a complaint by a resident, Joginder Singh. In his complaint, Singh claimed that St Gee Varghese Public School's building was in a poor state and was not running from the same building for which it had got recognition.

Section 55 of the Delhi School Education Act & Rules (DSEAR), 1973, states that prior approval from the DoE is required before shifting the school to a new location: ""If a recognised school ceases to function; or is shifted to a different locality; or is transferred to a different trust, society, individual or a group of individuals; without previous approval of the appropriate authority, its recognition shall lapse on such censer, shifting or transfer, as the case may be... It shall, for the purpose of future recognition, be treated as a new school.""

In 2014, officials said the district education office had conducted an inquiry against the school. An inquiry committee found that the school, in its records, had shown ghost employees as well as students, and that there was just one attendance register for students from nursery to Class VIII. The DoE issued a showcause notice to the school management in 2017 to explain the anomalies. While the school had denied the other allegations, it said that the building was in poor shape and required repair. Hence, a nearby building was taken on rent and students of classes VI-VIII were shifted there.

""The school violated many provisions of the DSEAR. We have been conducting an inquiry since 2014. Despite issuing a showcause notice, the school failed to comply. Action had to be initiated,"" a senior DoE official said. The committee had also verified the SLC of a child studying in Mother Marry Public School and found that it was issued by St Gee Varghese Public School.

""The committee was constituted to simplify the existing procedure, not to amend the Act. The committee is still in existence and examining the provision. Probably in a month or two, it may finalise a decision and announce it,"" said a spokesperson from the DoE.

Singh and Tyagi argue that in the wake of closure threats issued by the Delhi government to unrecognised schools in the city, where lakhs of students are studying, the committee's say in the decision-making process could save thousands of schools from closing before the start of the new academic session.

Chandrakant Singh, had also sent a letter to Delhi Education Minister and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia requesting him not to close any of the unrecognised schools until a decision was taken by the committee.

The request was then forwarded by Sisodia's office to the DoE, asking Director Saumya Gupta to ""look into the matter for taking appropriate action"". ""No one has the right to put the future of lakhs of students at stake,"" said Singh."

It also lacked the mandatory requirement of No Objection Certificate (NOC) from government, petitioner alleged.

""It is for the state or central board to take a call on whether recognition shall or shall not be granted. Director of Education should decide whether the NOC shall be given or not.

The school had come to limelight in March 2017, when the Class XII students of this school did not get their roll numbers for board exams.

DEO Anujit Kaur said, ""We have proposed that the recognition be withdrawn for classes XI and XII from the next academic session (2018-19)."" The copy of the letter sent on January 9 is with TOI.

The education department had formed a committee and conducted an inquiry. In the letter, DEO has referred to the committee's report and stated, ""There is total mismanagement of the records and lots of anomalies are visible in the admission process.""

The letter further adds that the school authorities had not informed the parents of the students regarding the norms for the classes and ruined the precious time of their life by misguiding them. It was further stated that, ""There is malpractice found in general administration of the school.""

The report was submitted by the committee last year and had proposed to review the recognition of the school with effect from March 31, 2018 and also, to review the affiliation from CBSE.

A showcause notice was issued to the principal and keeping in view the reply, the education department had first written to CBSE to withdraw the affiliation but the board had written back asking the education department to withdraw the recognition first. This was reported by TOI in July 2017.

Thereafter, the department had again written to the school and, the DEO has once again written to DSE to ""withdraw the recognition of the school of senior secondary level from the current academic year (2018-19).""

The letter reads proposed officials have already informed the school verbally to not admit students in Class XI and XII in the new session. The school has also been warned that if anomalies are found in class X result this year then the school will be downgraded further to lower level.

The school authorities could not be contacted for a comment.
