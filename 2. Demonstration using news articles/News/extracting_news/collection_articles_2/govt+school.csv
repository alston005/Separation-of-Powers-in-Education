Farmers in Gorai and Tamautiya villages of Aligarh were forced to lock up the cows as several acres of farmlands have been destroyed by the bovines, left stray by their owners after they no longer yielded milk. Cow Slaughter, Banned by UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Creates Bovine Menace in State.

Speaking to reporters, the local farmers in Tamautiya said they are forced to remain awake throughout the nights in their fields to prevent the stray cattle from eating the the near-ready to harvest crops.

The number of bovines have multiplied exponentially over the past couple of years, since the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP was elected to power. The state government has rigorously enforced a ban on the slaughter of cows and cow progeny.

Apart from the government-enforced ban, vigilantes affiliated to some right-wing groups have been involved in attacks on cattle traders -- which has forced many of them to abandon their animals.

The incident on Tuesday in Aligarh led to a brief law and order violation as well, as the police team which arrived to free the cattle and take them to the nearest gaushala faced protests, including stone-pelting. The demonstrators were mobilised through a WhatsApp rumour claiming that the cows are being sent for slaughter.

The situation was brought under control, said said senior police officer Ajay Kumar Sahni, adding that four miscreants have been arrested."

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

According to the plea, Desai's husband, Sameer, worked as a peon in the school and his post was an approved one with his salary being paid by the government. However, he died on November 2, 2011 and Samita was left with two minor children. On March 26, 2012, the school management decided to appoint her in place of her husband on compassionate grounds.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts. The stand taken by the sate that a number of similarly situated persons are still awaiting regularisation of their services for want of vacancies, cannot be accepted as gospel truth,"" the order reads. Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Now, the school education department has to spend over and above the allocated budget of Rs 27,000 crore or seek funds from Centre again, at a meeting scheduled later this year.

Policy documents suggest that the state has relied on SSA funds in the past. Documents reveal that the Centre has delayed release of promised funds as well. For instance, the state could not begin construction of 880 toilets for children with disabilities for more than a year, due to short receipt of funds from HRD.

Eventually, students are at the receiving end of the delay, say experts. Education activist C Gopal said, ""Many toilets in government schools are poorly maintained forcing children to relieve themselves in secluded corners within the school premises"".

Government teachers in Rajasthan have resented a government 'diktat' to mark their compulsory attendance for a government-sponsored Teachers Day event in Jaipur. The BJP-led Vasundhara Raje government organised a grand Teachers Day on Wednesday at Amroodon Ka Baagh in the state capital.

The Education Department made it compulsory for all teachers, who got their jobs after December 13, 2013 -- the day Raje took over as Chief Minister -- to attend the programme. Around 50,000 teachers attended the event. Speaking to IANS, a Jodhpur-based teacher, who declined to disclose his name, said, ""We had to travel all the way from Jodhpur, about 330 km from the state capital.""

""In Digital India, is there any need to call thousands of teachers to the state capital when video conferencing facility is available in all cities and towns? Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been interacting with people via Mann Ki Baat. The Chief Minister could also have arranged video conferencing and saved money,"" he said.

A teacher who came from Hanumangarh, a 7-hour train jouney, told IANS that teachers were being made victims in the politically-charged environment in the state. ""We have been asked to stay in government schools. We are aware what kind of arrangements are available in these schools,"" he said.

""We were promised travel allowance, but we have been spending from our pockets,"" he complained. Yet another teacher from Jodhpur said that it would have been better had this programme seen voluntary participation from teachers. ""This is a diktat for us. We had to leave all our work...we worked for this event for a week and were mainly focused on preparations for this event,"" he said.

Long queues of vehicles were seen in the city throughout the day. ""There was no need to create such a mess on roads,"" he said. When asked why they can not disclose their names, the teachers had a common opinion. ""We are already under pressure to attend this event. If we disclose our identity, we might lose our jobs.""

The Rajasthan Education Department made it compulsory for all government teachers appointed after December 13, 2013, to attend the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur. Raje took oath on December 13, 2013, and the day marks the start of the term of the government.

The Opposition Congress has criticised the move, questioning the government as to how the Raje government could differentiate between teachers.

Former Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said: ""The government's behaviour towards teachers is condemnable. Teachers are not slaves of the government. This is not a respectable invite for them."" He said taxpayers' money too was being wasted on ""meaningless programmes.""

Surendra Saharan, patron, Rajasthan Senior Teacher's Association said, ""Verbal instructions were given to all teachers to avoid wearing black- colour outfits. We submitted a memorandum to the Education Department, but to no avail,"" he said. ""The government decision to invite new appointees while ignoring their seniors is sheer politicisation of education,"" Saharan added.

When Kankanala Kishan Reddy, 56, walked into Garshakurthi village's Government Primary School as its headmaster in 2013, he was shocked to find that it had only 39 students, with all the other children in the area going to private English medium schools. Since he was himself an alumnus of the same school, he felt a pang of disappointment. He decided to do something about it.

Mr. Reddy first convinced the education authorities concerned to make English the medium of instruction in the school from 2015-16. He then visited every household and persuaded the parents to enrol their wards in the government school.

Next, he spent his own money to buy textbooks in English worth ₹50,000 for the first academic year of 2015-16. For 2016-17, he spent ₹25,000 on purchase of books. He again used his own funds to purchase ties, belts, and ID cards for the students, so that they in no way felt inferior to their private school counterparts. Thanks to all these measures, the school's student strength now stands at 177.

But a major problem still remained: transportation. Students from the adjoining villages frequently bunked class due to lack of adequate transportation facilities.

So Mr. Reddy purchased a second-hand seven-seater autorickshaw to ferry the students to school and back, again by spending ₹80,000 of his own money. He appointed a driver on a salary of ₹5,000 a month, to be paid from his own pocket.

The driver starts his day with a trip from Kondapur village, about 7 km from the school, which brings in around 11 students. The second trip is from Achampalli village, located 3 km from the school, carrying 15 students. The third trip, from Kasaram and Garshakurthi villages, transports another 20 students. Parents who earlier used to fork out ₹500 per head per month to hire private autorickshaws now pay only ₹200 per head per month, and the money is used to pay for fuel. The autorickshaw drops the kids back home in the evening.

Mr. Reddy said that he had purchased the auto only because he wanted to provide safe, comfortable, and cheap transportation for the students coming from villages that are not at a walking distance.

He said that the auto driver was appointed with the consent of the village education committee. He hoped that, with quality education in the school, the student strength would cross 200 in the next academic year."

As she rushed through the task, her classmate patiently waited her to finish.

The class VII student at the school has to do the same thing every day after class because she has not received textbooks for any subject -- which were meant to be provided by the school administration -- even as the ongoing academic session has entered in its sixth month.

The Sarvodaya school, which started functioning in April last year was hailed as an example for how government schools should be run in the Capital and across the country. Not only did it have a spanking new building with a playground, no vacant posts for teachers, and a supply of books and study materials.

The school had become so popular that at least 800 students had moved from private schools in the vicinity to this school, according to the school administration, the Delhi government and parents of students, because of better facilities available free of cost.

But, school officials and parents say that, 17 months later, the school is fast becoming like any other government institution in the city, with 'guest teachers' being hired to fill regular teaching posts and about 30% of the students between Classes VI and VII not receiving textbooks and other study material that they are entitled to under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

""I have to copy everything taught by the teachers during the classes as I don't have textbooks to read at home. I like reading. I have copied this poem today. I will read it out to my younger sister at home,"" said the student cited above. She was studying in a private school in the neighbourhood until last year and had moved because of the facilities available at the Rohini government school.

""I have to wait for her to complete her work every day. The class teacher told me that the books will come by the end of this month,"" said the student's mother.

Other parents complained of the same problem. ""I have come here to meet the principal to know about the status of my grandson's books. He has to go at his friend's place every day for whatever work he gets at the school. The officials say that my grandson will not fail the exams as there is some policy for it. But what will he learn without books?"" said the grandfather of a Class VIII student who is among the 20 students in his class who has not received textbooks yet.

As per the section 8 (1) of the Delhi RTE rules, students studying at government schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms up to Class VIII.

Officials at the school say they have provided books to around 80% students. ""Only those who got late admissions are yet to receive text books. We do not have exact number of such students. This year, we got unprecedented number of admissions. The strength is almost doubled from last year's tally of 1,000 admissions,"" said an official who asked not to be named.

The school was also struggling with inadequate staffing till late July. ""The school was not ready to cater the needs of so many students. Until July,it was struggling with shortage of teachers. The teachers were taking combined classes of different sections. We had received complaints from parents and then raised it with the school authority.The problem was fixed after the government deployed 15 guest teachers in August,"" said Satyprakash, convener of the Delhi chapter of All India Parents Association, who has been visiting the school since last year.

Officials at the Directorate of Education (DoE) accepted there was a problem with the supply of books and contended that it had been caused due to a delayed request by the school.

When contacted, Delhi's education minister Manish Sisodia said that he will look into the matter. ""As per my knowledge, we have streamlined the supply of books which was conventionally late every year. But, in this case, I will have to inquire and fix where our system is still failing,"" Sisodia told the Hindustan Times.

Experts working in the field, however, said the situation was similar to what was faced by several other government schools. ""This is just one example. Thousands of students studying in Delhi government schools are waiting for books. We have been receiving such complaints on a daily basis. How do they expect students to study without books?"" said Khagesh Jha of social jurist, an education NGO.

""As you can see the ceiling of our classroom is leaking so we have no option but to study under an umbrella. We always carry umbrellas to our classroom,"" Muskan, a Class 1 student, is heard saying in the video.

It is not just the leaking roofs of the school, which has just two rooms, that has the children and their parents worried.

""Most of the time parents discourage us from going to school as the building is in a bad condition. Things are scary here. We don't know when our school building will collapse,"" Muskan says.

""Many parents want to withdraw their children from the school as the building is not safe. The leakage has also caused a drop in attendance,"" their teacher, Sunita Mishra, is also heard saying in the video.

She says that they have sent a number of applications to the state education department and the civic bodies in the area but no one has responded so far.

The school gets funds under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a government programme aimed at boosting education among children in the country. And, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh earmarked Rs 18,167 crore for the programme in its budget for this financial year.

The state's basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal said it was shocking to see students sitting with an umbrella in a classroom.

""We will shift the students to some another building. We cannot compromise with the safety of our students,"" Jaiswal said as she promised to seek a detailed report from her department.

With their contribution, the infrastructure of 425 government schools has been improved so far, and the project has set a target for 4250 schools to be converted into smart schools by the end of this academic session.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building, so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school it is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to a upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The plea is likely to come up for hearing on Friday before a bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao.

The application was filed by NGO Social Jurist in a pending petition highlighting the denial of admission to over 400 students in government schools in the national capital.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, claimed that there was violation of the Delhi School Education Rules in refusing readmission to 42,503 students who had appeared for the Class 10 examinations this year, but failed.

The plea alleged that instead of granting them readmission in the same government school, the students were forced to take transfer certificate (TC) and opt for the National Institute of Open Schooling instead.

It said that out of the 1,36,663 government school students who took the Class 10 exams this year, 94,160 passed and 42,503 failed. The students took a compartmental examination, but failed in that too.

""Last Eid, I left my children with my parents and instead joined the teachers agitation in Srinagar, demanding our salaries, which we have been denied for months together. Nobody is paying attention to our demands.

Hundreds of teachers like Mumtaza who have been employed under a centrally sponsored scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) in J&K are fighting a lonely battle over last few years, demanding payment of their salaries on a regular basis and availing benefits under seventh pay commission.

The teachers today refused to join work as a result of which the classwork in government and primary middle schools remained affected.

However, the successive state governments have reasoned that the salaries of the school teachers are funded by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development and that the induction and regularisation of the school teachers under the state rules is an uphill task.

This has led to a growing resentment among the school teachers in the valley who have protested outside the State Assembly, Raj Bhavan and also gone on hunger strikes.

On Monday, the teachers again staged statewide protests demanding the payment of their salaries and also availing benefits under the seventh pay commission.

The state government although agreed to pay a two months salary to the teachers, but the measure is described as inadequate by the protesting teachers.

""They pay heed to our demands only during the time of festivals and various issues we have still remain unresolved. We are serving in some of the remotest corners of the state, across schools where enrollment of poor children is very high.

Although, statistically, it is a 100% rise from last year when just two candidates made the cut, government school students have bagged an abysmal 0.16% of available MBBS seats this year.

In 2016, when admissions were based on Class XII marks alone, a total of 30 government school students secured MBBS seats. With just two more seats in government colleges available for mop-up counselling to be held on August 23, data released by state selection committee shows a steep 80% fall compared to 2016 admissions.

The performance of government-aided schools is slightly better -- 26 students joined MBBS courses.

""NEET has left behind a section of students who can't afford to pay high fees under the management quota or in deemed universities. Even with special training it may take a few years before they compete with students passing out of private schools,"" said Doctors for Social Equality general secretary Dr G R Ravindranath.

Errors in Tamil question papers were the biggest disadvantage for government school students, said K Kamatchi, a Class XII biology teacher. ""We encouraged many students to take the exam in Tamil. But 49 questions were wrong. The high court order to offer 196 additional marks was also turned down by the Supreme Court,"" she said.

Admission to all medical and dental colleges is conducted by the state committee based on NEET-2018 marks, in accordance with the 69% reservation for backward and SC/ST communities.

The difference in scores compared to last year was the smallest among ST category (39) and widest among MBCs (88). For open category, it is 42 marks higher than last year.

Selection committee secretary G Selvarajan said half the number of students admitted to MBBS courses in 2018 were break-year students. ""There were 1,680 students who passed Class XII in 2017, and 120 who passed in 2016. Nearly 51% of the students have taken a break to better their NEET scores,"" he said. The new trend, however, is MBBS aspirants opting to write NEET for the second time.

The NEET-2018 topper scored 676 marks - 20 more than last year. Eighty-one students scored above 550 in NEET in both 2017 and 2018. But there are 213 students who got 500 or more compared to 203 students last year. The gap widened as the scores went down. For instance, there were 1,279 students above 400 compared to 1,466 last year and 4,791 above 300 compared to 2,569 last year.

But when he got there, what he saw shocked him. The school was utterly dilapidated and Ramesh couldn't bear to see it in that condition.

Together with his father M Ramesh Babu and grandfather V Muthuraman, Krithik decided to start Empowering Rural India Foundation, a non-profit organisation, with the aim of uplifting government schools across the country.

But soon, Krithik realised that he did not have enough funds to take his vision forward. His folks suggested he look for sponsors.

Once he had the funds ready, Krithik approached the school management. Upon enquiring about the needs of the school, he was told that it faced occasional power outages, and the headmaster suggested that installation of solar panels would be of great help.

The family approached many solar service providers before finally zeroing in on a company, that two weeks ago, successfully managed to provide the school with the necessary infrastructure. With the installation of solar panels, the school can now easily save up to Rs 15,000 that otherwise was spent on electricity bills once in two months.

Interestingly, the solar panels can produce about 2kW of power, which is more than what the school needs. So, Krithik suggested that the school sell the excess power to the state electricity board.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

As many as 60 students of the Government Primary School in Urumandampalayam will no longer skip the first meal of the day as a group of socially-minded people have joined hands to serve freshly-cooked breakfast free of cost.

The free breakfast scheme, a joint initiative of a few philanthropists, alumni and members of the public, was launched on Tuesday to coincide with the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi and death anniversary of former chief minister K. Kamaraj, who introduced mid-day meal scheme in schools.

While Tamil Nadu sought Rs 43 crore for the purpose, the Union human resources development ministry approved only Rs 12 crore. Paucity of funds is cited as the reason for not releasing the entire amount, suggests minutes of the project approval board meeting held at New Delhi on July 31.

Policy documents suggest that the state has relied on SSA funds in the past. Documents reveal that the Centre has delayed release of promised funds as well. For instance, the state could not begin construction of 880 toilets for children with disabilities for more than a year, due to short receipt of funds from HRD.

The schools, which have received more than '5,000 for purchase of uniforms and shoes, have been asked to sign an agreement with one of the GST registered distributors in their locality and maintain all details regarding procurement in school record books, they added.

When Kankanala Kishan Reddy, 56, walked into Garshakurthi village's Government Primary School as its headmaster in 2013, he was shocked to find that it had only 39 students, with all the other children in the area going to private English medium schools. Since he was himself an alumnus of the same school, he felt a pang of disappointment. He decided to do something about it.

Mr. Reddy first convinced the education authorities concerned to make English the medium of instruction in the school from 2015-16. He then visited every household and persuaded the parents to enrol their wards in the government school.

Next, he spent his own money to buy textbooks in English worth ₹50,000 for the first academic year of 2015-16. For 2016-17, he spent ₹25,000 on purchase of books. He again used his own funds to purchase ties, belts, and ID cards for the students, so that they in no way felt inferior to their private school counterparts. Thanks to all these measures, the school's student strength now stands at 177.

But a major problem still remained: transportation. Students from the adjoining villages frequently bunked class due to lack of adequate transportation facilities.

So Mr. Reddy purchased a second-hand seven-seater autorickshaw to ferry the students to school and back, again by spending ₹80,000 of his own money. He appointed a driver on a salary of ₹5,000 a month, to be paid from his own pocket.

The driver starts his day with a trip from Kondapur village, about 7 km from the school, which brings in around 11 students. The second trip is from Achampalli village, located 3 km from the school, carrying 15 students. The third trip, from Kasaram and Garshakurthi villages, transports another 20 students. Parents who earlier used to fork out ₹500 per head per month to hire private autorickshaws now pay only ₹200 per head per month, and the money is used to pay for fuel. The autorickshaw drops the kids back home in the evening.

Mr. Reddy said that he had purchased the auto only because he wanted to provide safe, comfortable, and cheap transportation for the students coming from villages that are not at a walking distance.

He said that the auto driver was appointed with the consent of the village education committee. He hoped that, with quality education in the school, the student strength would cross 200 in the next academic year."

As she rushed through the task, her classmate patiently waited her to finish.

The class VII student at the school has to do the same thing every day after class because she has not received textbooks for any subject -- which were meant to be provided by the school administration -- even as the ongoing academic session has entered in its sixth month.

The Sarvodaya school, which started functioning in April last year was hailed as an example for how government schools should be run in the Capital and across the country. Not only did it have a spanking new building with a playground, no vacant posts for teachers, and a supply of books and study materials.

The school had become so popular that at least 800 students had moved from private schools in the vicinity to this school, according to the school administration, the Delhi government and parents of students, because of better facilities available free of cost.

But, school officials and parents say that, 17 months later, the school is fast becoming like any other government institution in the city, with 'guest teachers' being hired to fill regular teaching posts and about 30% of the students between Classes VI and VII not receiving textbooks and other study material that they are entitled to under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

""I have to copy everything taught by the teachers during the classes as I don't have textbooks to read at home. I like reading. I have copied this poem today. I will read it out to my younger sister at home,"" said the student cited above. She was studying in a private school in the neighbourhood until last year and had moved because of the facilities available at the Rohini government school.

""I have to wait for her to complete her work every day. The class teacher told me that the books will come by the end of this month,"" said the student's mother.

Other parents complained of the same problem. ""I have come here to meet the principal to know about the status of my grandson's books. He has to go at his friend's place every day for whatever work he gets at the school. The officials say that my grandson will not fail the exams as there is some policy for it. But what will he learn without books?"" said the grandfather of a Class VIII student who is among the 20 students in his class who has not received textbooks yet.

As per the section 8 (1) of the Delhi RTE rules, students studying at government schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms up to Class VIII.

Officials at the school say they have provided books to around 80% students. ""Only those who got late admissions are yet to receive text books. We do not have exact number of such students. This year, we got unprecedented number of admissions. The strength is almost doubled from last year's tally of 1,000 admissions,"" said an official who asked not to be named.

The school was also struggling with inadequate staffing till late July. ""The school was not ready to cater the needs of so many students. Until July,it was struggling with shortage of teachers. The teachers were taking combined classes of different sections. We had received complaints from parents and then raised it with the school authority.The problem was fixed after the government deployed 15 guest teachers in August,"" said Satyprakash, convener of the Delhi chapter of All India Parents Association, who has been visiting the school since last year.

Officials at the Directorate of Education (DoE) accepted there was a problem with the supply of books and contended that it had been caused due to a delayed request by the school.

When contacted, Delhi's education minister Manish Sisodia said that he will look into the matter. ""As per my knowledge, we have streamlined the supply of books which was conventionally late every year. But, in this case, I will have to inquire and fix where our system is still failing,"" Sisodia told the Hindustan Times.

Experts working in the field, however, said the situation was similar to what was faced by several other government schools. ""This is just one example. Thousands of students studying in Delhi government schools are waiting for books. We have been receiving such complaints on a daily basis. How do they expect students to study without books?"" said Khagesh Jha of social jurist, an education NGO.

The children can be seen with umbrellas in one hand and writing with the other in the video because the ceiling of their classroom leaks every time it rains in Banki, which is around 30 km from the state capital of Lucknow.

""As you can see the ceiling of our classroom is leaking so we have no option but to study under an umbrella. We always carry umbrellas to our classroom,"" Muskan, a Class 1 student, is heard saying in the video.

It is not just the leaking roofs of the school, which has just two rooms, that has the children and their parents worried.

""Most of the time parents discourage us from going to school as the building is in a bad condition. Things are scary here. We don't know when our school building will collapse,"" Muskan says.

""Many parents want to withdraw their children from the school as the building is not safe. The leakage has also caused a drop in attendance,"" their teacher, Sunita Mishra, is also heard saying in the video.

She says that they have sent a number of applications to the state education department and the civic bodies in the area but no one has responded so far.

The school gets funds under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a government programme aimed at boosting education among children in the country. And, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh earmarked Rs 18,167 crore for the programme in its budget for this financial year.

The state's basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal said it was shocking to see students sitting with an umbrella in a classroom.

""We will shift the students to some another building. We cannot compromise with the safety of our students,"" Jaiswal said as she promised to seek a detailed report from her department.

Basic Shiksha Adhikari Vinay Kumar said the matter has come to his knowledge.

""I have asked the block education officer to shift the school temporarily to another building and submit a report. Funds have also been issued for the maintenance of the school,"" Kumar said."

PUNJAB GOVERNMENT is looking at NGOs, charitable trusts and private firms to improve critical infrastructure in its government schools, to address the financial deficit that government schools face.

Punjab government's Education Department has already launched a project in government schools in the state under its smart school project to enhance the overall performance of school.

A letter by the Director General School Education (DGSE) -cum-State Project Director office to NGOs and all others said that in addition to this, the schools can be supported by introducing digital education (setting up smart class rooms); constructing more class rooms , laboratories and toilets; providing books in libraries; uniform to the students; furniture and free boards in class rooms; creating infrastructure for mid day meals and sports; installing solar power system and RO water coolers and any other way that the donors and schools deem fit.

With their contribution, the infrastructure of 425 government schools has been improved so far, and the project has set a target for 4250 schools to be converted into smart schools by the end of this academic session.

""With the contribution of such people and organisations, we want to create a sense of belonging in the community that will fund it, so that it will become a sustainable model through ownership and accountability,"" said Kumar, adding that the government will provide support in teaching and resolving specific problems, which will enhance the performance of the government schools in every possible manner.

Education Minister Manish Sisodia had ordered the inquiry following complaints. Following the completion of the inquiry, she was suspended.

She added that other models would help them learn numerals, basic arithmetic, alphabets and two-four letter words.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building, so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school it is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to a upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

In 2016, when admissions were based on Class XII marks alone, a total of 30 government school students secured MBBS seats. With just two more seats in government colleges available for mop-up counselling to be held on August 23, data released by state selection committee shows a steep 80% fall compared to 2016 admissions.

The difference in scores compared to last year was the smallest among ST category (39) and widest among MBCs (88). For open category, it is 42 marks higher than last year.

Selection committee secretary G Selvarajan said half the number of students admitted to MBBS courses in 2018 were break-year students. ""There were 1,680 students who passed Class XII in 2017, and 120 who passed in 2016. Nearly 51% of the students have taken a break to better their NEET scores,"" he said.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements.

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts. The stand taken by the sate that a number of similarly situated persons are still awaiting regularisation of their services for want of vacancies, cannot be accepted as gospel truth,"" the order reads. Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

Advocate Charanpal Singh Bagri told The Indian Express on Thursday that they were waiting for the verdict since July as the court had reserved it and it was made available on Wednesday."

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Policy documents suggest that the state has relied on SSA funds in the past. Documents reveal that the Centre has delayed release of promised funds as well. For instance, the state could not begin construction of 880 toilets for children with disabilities for more than a year, due to short receipt of funds from HRD.

Eventually, students are at the receiving end of the delay, say experts. Education activist C Gopal said, ""Many toilets in government schools are poorly maintained forcing children to relieve themselves in secluded corners within the school premises"".

Government teachers in Rajasthan have resented a government 'diktat' to mark their compulsory attendance for a government-sponsored Teachers Day event in Jaipur. The BJP-led Vasundhara Raje government organised a grand Teachers Day on Wednesday at Amroodon Ka Baagh in the state capital.

The Education Department made it compulsory for all teachers, who got their jobs after December 13, 2013 -- the day Raje took over as Chief Minister -- to attend the programme. Around 50,000 teachers attended the event. Speaking to IANS, a Jodhpur-based teacher, who declined to disclose his name, said, ""We had to travel all the way from Jodhpur, about 330 km from the state capital.""

""In Digital India, is there any need to call thousands of teachers to the state capital when video conferencing facility is available in all cities and towns?

""We were promised travel allowance, but we have been spending from our pockets,"" he complained. Yet another teacher from Jodhpur said that it would have been better had this programme seen voluntary participation from teachers. ""This is a diktat for us. We had to leave all our work...we worked for this event for a week and were mainly focused on preparations for this event,"" he said.

Long queues of vehicles were seen in the city throughout the day. ""There was no need to create such a mess on roads,"" he said. When asked why they can not disclose their names, the teachers had a common opinion. ""We are already under pressure to attend this event. If we disclose our identity, we might lose our jobs.""

The Rajasthan Education Department made it compulsory for all government teachers appointed after December 13, 2013, to attend the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur. Raje took oath on December 13, 2013, and the day marks the start of the term of the government.

The Opposition Congress has criticised the move, questioning the government as to how the Raje government could differentiate between teachers.

Former Chief Minister and Congress leader Ashok Gehlot said: ""The government's behaviour towards teachers is condemnable. Teachers are not slaves of the government. This is not a respectable invite for them."" He said taxpayers' money too was being wasted on ""meaningless programmes.""

Surendra Saharan, patron, Rajasthan Senior Teacher's Association said, ""Verbal instructions were given to all teachers to avoid wearing black- colour outfits. We submitted a memorandum to the Education Department, but to no avail,"" he said. ""The government decision to invite new appointees while ignoring their seniors is sheer politicisation of education,"" Saharan added.

Next, he spent his own money to buy textbooks in English worth ₹50,000 for the first academic year of 2015-16. For 2016-17, he spent ₹25,000 on purchase of books. He again used his own funds to purchase ties, belts, and ID cards for the students, so that they in no way felt inferior to their private school counterparts. Thanks to all these measures, the school's student strength now stands at 177.

But a major problem still remained: transportation. Students from the adjoining villages frequently bunked class due to lack of adequate transportation facilities.

So Mr. Reddy purchased a second-hand seven-seater autorickshaw to ferry the students to school and back, again by spending ₹80,000 of his own money. He appointed a driver on a salary of ₹5,000 a month, to be paid from his own pocket.

The driver starts his day with a trip from Kondapur village, about 7 km from the school, which brings in around 11 students. The second trip is from Achampalli village, located 3 km from the school, carrying 15 students. The third trip, from Kasaram and Garshakurthi villages, transports another 20 students. Parents who earlier used to fork out ₹500 per head per month to hire private autorickshaws now pay only ₹200 per head per month, and the money is used to pay for fuel. The autorickshaw drops the kids back home in the evening.

Mr. Reddy said that he had purchased the auto only because he wanted to provide safe, comfortable, and cheap transportation for the students coming from villages that are not at a walking distance.

He said that the auto driver was appointed with the consent of the village education committee. He hoped that, with quality education in the school, the student strength would cross 200 in the next academic year."

As she rushed through the task, her classmate patiently waited her to finish.

The class VII student at the school has to do the same thing every day after class because she has not received textbooks for any subject -- which were meant to be provided by the school administration -- even as the ongoing academic session has entered in its sixth month.

The Sarvodaya school, which started functioning in April last year was hailed as an example for how government schools should be run in the Capital and across the country. Not only did it have a spanking new building with a playground, no vacant posts for teachers, and a supply of books and study materials.

The school had become so popular that at least 800 students had moved from private schools in the vicinity to this school, according to the school administration, the Delhi government and parents of students, because of better facilities available free of cost.

But, school officials and parents say that, 17 months later, the school is fast becoming like any other government institution in the city, with 'guest teachers' being hired to fill regular teaching posts and about 30% of the students between Classes VI and VII not receiving textbooks and other study material that they are entitled to under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009.

""I have to copy everything taught by the teachers during the classes as I don't have textbooks to read at home. I like reading. I have copied this poem today. I will read it out to my younger sister at home,"" said the student cited above. She was studying in a private school in the neighbourhood until last year and had moved because of the facilities available at the Rohini government school.

""I have to wait for her to complete her work every day. The class teacher told me that the books will come by the end of this month,"" said the student's mother.

Other parents complained of the same problem. ""I have come here to meet the principal to know about the status of my grandson's books. He has to go at his friend's place every day for whatever work he gets at the school. The officials say that my grandson will not fail the exams as there is some policy for it. But what will he learn without books?"" said the grandfather of a Class VIII student who is among the 20 students in his class who has not received textbooks yet.

As per the section 8 (1) of the Delhi RTE rules, students studying at government schools are entitled to free textbooks, writing material and uniforms up to Class VIII.

Officials at the school say they have provided books to around 80% students. ""Only those who got late admissions are yet to receive text books. We do not have exact number of such students. This year, we got unprecedented number of admissions. The strength is almost doubled from last year's tally of 1,000 admissions,"" said an official who asked not to be named.

The school was also struggling with inadequate staffing till late July. ""The school was not ready to cater the needs of so many students. Until July,it was struggling with shortage of teachers. The teachers were taking combined classes of different sections. We had received complaints from parents and then raised it with the school authority.The problem was fixed after the government deployed 15 guest teachers in August,"" said Satyprakash, convener of the Delhi chapter of All India Parents Association, who has been visiting the school since last year.

Officials at the Directorate of Education (DoE) accepted there was a problem with the supply of books and contended that it had been caused due to a delayed request by the school.

When contacted, Delhi's education minister Manish Sisodia said that he will look into the matter. ""As per my knowledge, we have streamlined the supply of books which was conventionally late every year. But, in this case, I will have to inquire and fix where our system is still failing,"" Sisodia told the Hindustan Times.

Experts working in the field, however, said the situation was similar to what was faced by several other government schools. ""This is just one example. Thousands of students studying in Delhi government schools are waiting for books. We have been receiving such complaints on a daily basis. How do they expect students to study without books?"" said Khagesh Jha of social jurist, an education NGO.

""As you can see the ceiling of our classroom is leaking so we have no option but to study under an umbrella. We always carry umbrellas to our classroom,"" Muskan, a Class 1 student, is heard saying in the video.

It is not just the leaking roofs of the school, which has just two rooms, that has the children and their parents worried.

""Most of the time parents discourage us from going to school as the building is in a bad condition. Things are scary here. We don't know when our school building will collapse,"" Muskan says.

""Many parents want to withdraw their children from the school as the building is not safe. The leakage has also caused a drop in attendance,"" their teacher, Sunita Mishra, is also heard saying in the video.

She says that they have sent a number of applications to the state education department and the civic bodies in the area but no one has responded so far.

The school gets funds under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a government programme aimed at boosting education among children in the country. And, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Uttar Pradesh earmarked Rs 18,167 crore for the programme in its budget for this financial year.

The state's basic education minister Anupama Jaiswal said it was shocking to see students sitting with an umbrella in a classroom.

""We will shift the students to some another building. We cannot compromise with the safety of our students,"" Jaiswal said as she promised to seek a detailed report from her department.

Basic Shiksha Adhikari Vinay Kumar said the matter has come to his knowledge.

With their contribution, the infrastructure of 425 government schools has been improved so far, and the project has set a target for 4250 schools to be converted into smart schools by the end of this academic session.

A landslide on August 9 had torn through the school's one-acre compound and created two craters near the building and making it inaccessible.

Until Monday, the teachers and villagers were unsure of the future of the institute's 92 students.

In two days, the uncertainty gave way to a new-found confidence -- now seen across the state -- as the exuberant students started school on the top floor of a madrassa, barely a kilometre away.

The temporary establishment has become a symbol of communal harmony and determination of a resilient village that refused to be cowed down by adverse conditions, despite their debilitating effect.

There was an effort to clean up the three-foot mud and slush from the school building, so that the classes could commence. Recurring landslides, however, posed a constant risk, forcing the authorities and volunteers to abandon their efforts.

Realising the need for continuing the school, the local mahal committee stepped in and offered space in the Hayathul Islam Madrassa building. Local residents and volunteers swung into action and made necessary arrangements on the top floor of the building.

They converted the top floor into a full-fledged school with four classrooms and a staffroom in 72 hours.

As the classes restarted on Wednesday morning, the building earned the distinction of having a madrassa, a mosque and a government school under the same roof.

The school, meanwhile, adjusted its working days. It would be closed on Fridays -- so that the faithful would have enough space for their prayers -- and instead, would work on Saturdays. The arrangement would continue for the rest of the academic year.

Authorities said the school would function in the madrassa until it a new building somewhere nearby.

Among the students who attended school on Wednesday, five have been rendered homeless by the landslides. A Facebook community, Human Being Collective, Malabar Flood Relief Forum and Green Palliative Volunteers had raised around Rs 4 lakh and helped the villagers recreate the school, which now sport brand new furniture, blackboards, teaching aids and colourful walls with animated characters and even indoor plants.

The pre-primary section has been accommodated in the madrassa's courtyard, where the Hayathul Islam mosque is also located.

""Even the children hailing from families who had suffered huge losses in the landslide were so happy on seeing their new school. It will immensely help them in erasing their traumatic experiences,"" district collector Keshvendra Kumar said.

The school it is also a reaffirmation of the secular credentials of Kerala where everyone is helping each other, cutting across religious, social and other barriers,"" who spent around three hours at the school, added.

The school's PTA President Mohammed Aslam, also the vice president of the mahal committee, said the entire mahal was very forthcoming in opening up its premises for the school. ""Though properties worth crores were lost in the landslide, our biggest loss was the Kurichiar Mala LP School. Most of the people in the village work in the nearby tea plantation and the school was their only hope for a better future of their children,"" Aslam said.

School headmaster Sasi P K said the deputy director of education has sanctioned the changes in the school working days to facilitate the Friday prayers at the mosque.

C K Saseendran, representing Kalpetta in the state assembly, said the school would be upgraded to a upper primary school with Rs 1 crore from the MLA fund and a Rs 49 lakh grant from the central government's multi-sectoral development programme. The Tata Group, meanwhile, has promised to construct a new building for the school on identifying a new location.

The district collector said the damaged school building would be converted to a memorial to showcase how the people overcame the natural calamity."

It noted that the competent authority had in principle granted approval for construction of the secondary school at Eidgah at Quresh Nagar in the Walled City. The Bench disposed the plea after the petitioner expressed satisfaction over the development.

The court had last year asked the government and the authorities concerned to explore the possibility of allotting land for the minority school. It had asked the Delhi Chief Secretary to coordinate with all agencies, including the DDA and the civic body.

The court was hearing a petition filed by civil activist Firoz Bakht Ahmed, who contended that the State of affairs at the Qaumi School was ""sad and pitiable"" as it was functioning from Eidgah grounds in Old Delhi after its building was demolished."

A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Thursday seeking directions to the Delhi government to grant readmission to 42,503 government school students, who failed the Class 10 CBSE exams this year, in the same institutions.

The plea is likely to come up for hearing on Friday before a bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao.

The application was filed by NGO Social Jurist in a pending petition highlighting the denial of admission to over 400 students in government schools in the national capital.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, claimed that there was violation of the Delhi School Education Rules in refusing readmission to 42,503 students who had appeared for the Class 10 examinations this year, but failed.

The plea alleged that instead of granting them readmission in the same government school, the students were forced to take transfer certificate (TC) and opt for the National Institute of Open Schooling instead.

It said that out of the 1,36,663 government school students who took the Class 10 exams this year, 94,160 passed and 42,503 failed. The students took a compartmental examination, but failed in that too.

Agarwal said he had sent a legal notice to the heads of the schools on August 20 with a copy sent to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, but readmission was not given to the students."

Mumtaza, 29 a resident of Budgam district in Jammu and Kashmir is not upbeat about Eid-al Adha this year. In fact, the last Eid also brought no cheer to her and family. Mumtaza, a government school teacher working in a primary school located in a remote village in Budgam, a few kilometres away from her house has not received her salary for the last three months.

A single mother, who lost her husband last year, she is the only bread earner for her family which comprise her two children.

This Eid also, Mumtaza says she would not be able to buy new clothes, good food for her children despite her working in a school.

""Last Eid, I left my children with my parents and instead joined the teachers agitation in Srinagar, demanding our salaries, which we have been denied for months together. Nobody is paying attention to our demands. Most of the teachers who work with me in the remote villages belong to poor families and we are the lone sources of income for our families,"" Mumtaza said.

Hundreds of teachers like Mumtaza who have been employed under a centrally sponsored scheme, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyaan (SSA) in J&K are fighting a lonely battle over last few years, demanding payment of their salaries on a regular basis and availing benefits under seventh pay commission.

The teachers today refused to join work as a result of which the classwork in government and primary middle schools remained affected.

However, the successive state governments have reasoned that the salaries of the school teachers are funded by the Ministry of Human Resources and Development and that the induction and regularisation of the school teachers under the state rules is an uphill task.

This has led to a growing resentment among the school teachers in the valley who have protested outside the State Assembly, Raj Bhavan and also gone on hunger strikes.

On Monday, the teachers again staged statewide protests demanding the payment of their salaries and also availing benefits under the seventh pay commission.

The state government although agreed to pay a two months salary to the teachers, but the measure is described as inadequate by the protesting teachers.

""They pay heed to our demands only during the time of festivals and various issues we have still remain unresolved. We are serving in some of the remotest corners of the state, across schools where enrollment of poor children is very high. If we are not paid regularly, the education sector in the state will suffer. But the government seems to be inconsiderate,"" Muhammad Fayaz, a protesting school teacher said."

Although, statistically, it is a 100% rise from last year when just two candidates made the cut, government school students have bagged an abysmal 0.16% of available MBBS seats this year.

In 2016, when admissions were based on Class XII marks alone, a total of 30 government school students secured MBBS seats. With just two more seats in government colleges available for mop-up counselling to be held on August 23, data released by state selection committee shows a steep 80% fall compared to 2016 admissions.

The performance of government-aided schools is slightly better -- 26 students joined MBBS courses.

""NEET has left behind a section of students who can't afford to pay high fees under the management quota or in deemed universities. Even with special training it may take a few years before they compete with students passing out of private schools,"" said Doctors for Social Equality general secretary Dr G R Ravindranath.

Errors in Tamil question papers were the biggest disadvantage for government school students, said K Kamatchi, a Class XII biology teacher. ""We encouraged many students to take the exam in Tamil. But 49 questions were wrong. The high court order to offer 196 additional marks was also turned down by the Supreme Court,"" she said.

Admission to all medical and dental colleges is conducted by the state committee based on NEET-2018 marks, in accordance with the 69% reservation for backward and SC/ST communities. But admission to MBBS courses in the state was tougher in 2018 compared to 2017, and the last student from a reserved category to enter a state-run medical college in the state this year had a score of 200 in NEET, as compared to 161 in 2017. The difference in scores compared to last year was the smallest among ST category (39) and widest among MBCs (88). For open category, it is 42 marks higher than last year.

Selection committee secretary G Selvarajan said half the number of students admitted to MBBS courses in 2018 were break-year students. ""There were 1,680 students who passed Class XII in 2017, and 120 who passed in 2016. Nearly 51% of the students have taken a break to better their NEET scores,"" he said. The new trend, however, is MBBS aspirants opting to write NEET for the second time.

The NEET-2018 topper scored 676 marks - 20 more than last year. Eighty-one students scored above 550 in NEET in both 2017 and 2018. But there are 213 students who got 500 or more compared to 203 students last year. The gap widened as the scores went down. For instance, there were 1,279 students above 400 compared to 1,466 last year and 4,791 above 300 compared to 2,569 last year.

On Monday, the committee said it would hold the mop-up counselling on Thursday to fill two seats in government medical colleges, 19 others in self-financing medical colleges and 9 seats in government dental colleges.

A detailed schedule for the mop-up will be hosted on www.tnhealth.org/ www.tnmedicalselection.org."

Many who came to school without having breakfast suffered from sunstroke and stomachache. He, however, was not one to turn a blind eye to the problem. Starting July, Ilamaran has been providing free breakfast for 120 students out of his pocket.

""I am happy to spend some time with the students in the morning when serving them food. We buy idli and pongal from the nearby Amma Unavagam,"" said Ilamaran, who is also president of the Tamil Nadu Teacher Association.

The teacher, who handles students of Classes VII and IX, first made a list of pupils from Classes I to X who skip their morning meal due to their financial status. Every day, Ilamaran serves a hot meal from 7.30am to 8am for students of Class X and 8.20am to 8.50am for those in Classes I to IX. This is just one of the many initiatives the school and its teachers have taken up.

Muni Ramaiah, the school's principal, has been instrumental in raising the number of students and teachers at the school.

""I previously worked as the headmaster of Chennai High School in MMDA Colony, Arumbakkam. When I joined, there were only 370 students but in four years, the strength rose to 980. The number of teachers also increased from 11 to 35,"" Ramaiah said. ""I am trying a similar strategy here. Starting September, the management has planned to provide free tuition for Class X students. Students who aren't scoring as well as they can are also given special coaching after school hours.""

The institution has 68 Class X students in their 2018-19 batch. It has achieved 100% pass results in Class X public examinations for the past six years. The school is introducing more facilities to increase its student population.

With the help of sponsors, the management has installed CCTV cameras at eight locations. ""We are the only government school to use a biometric system to monitor both teacher and student attendance. The device is installed outside the headmaster's room,"" Ramaiah said."

The actor-director tagged West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee and Derek O'Brien in his tweet.

Chatterjee on Sunday said the government will take necessary steps after finding out the details.
