Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

Close on the heels of accidents involving buses, in which a number of school children lost their lives and many others were injured, the state government on Wednesday banned school picnic buses from plying at night.

They had gone to Dangs for a picnic. In another incident, a bus conductor died and 24 children of a school in Ahmedabad were injured when their bus rammed into a tree in Godhra in the wee hours of Tuesday.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters that the decision had been taken during the weekly meeting of the state cabinet, presided over by chief minister Vijay Rupani.

""Our government has decided to impose a ban on buses with school children from plying between 11pm and 6am to avoid accidents such as these in the future,"" Patel said.

The deputy CM said the decision had been taken bearing in mind the safety of children.

""The bus operators will be required to stop the journey during night time. They will also have to make lodging and boarding arrangements for children,"" he further added.

Chief secretary Dr JN Singh said, ""The issue was discussed with utter sincerity in the cabinet. The government has made it mandatory for school authorities to get sanction from concerned RTO office for educational tours. The RTO will assess the condition of the vehicle for transportation and number of students travelling on the bus viz-a-viz capacity of the vehicle.""

In case of both accidents, private luxury buses had been hired for picnics. In the first case, the bus was hired by a tuition class. Eight children and two others were killed in the accident in Dangs. In the second one, one person was killed and two dozen children were injured when the bus, returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh, met with an accident near Godhra.

The Ahmedabad RTO released a circular saying that all tour operators will have to abide by the new rules and that the number of children can't exceed the total capacity of the vehicle. The RTO also announced that strict measures would be taken against those tour operators who flout rules."

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said. Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The teachers in turn will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

""We designed them in such a way that students can use them to keep their books on them and read. Tapes were used for providing a smooth finishing at edges. After testing the strength, we distributed them to students in eight government schools,"" she added.

Puducherry lt governor Kiran Bedi, former Indian cricketer Anil Kumble, first Indian to travel in space Rakesh Sharma and others were impressed by the idea and extended their support to the campaign, said an official release.

Though Shaastra started as a tech-fest, it broadened out into taking up a social initiative each year to create a positive impact in society.

The previous campaigns included producing liquid handwash bottles out of recycled soap, building toilets with used water bottles and pledge-a-book campaign aimed at distributing books to underprivileged children, the release added."

Speaking to The Shillong Times, Education Minister Lahkmen Rymbui said the direction to reduce weight of school bags and other matters as directed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development will be analysed by the government.

Though the minister admitted that it is necessary to reduce the burden of children, he said solid foundation of education should be imparted too.

""The root of education should not be weakened. We have to check the books as well. There is no need to rush as it is for the benefit of students,"" he added.

As the government still contemplates implementing the order, parents keep worrying about their children and the ""unnecessary"" pressure that they have to endure.

Another parent of a Class VI student was critical of the existing education system. According to him, more books and heavier bags do not make a student scholar.

""It is the way teachers teach in schools that makes a difference. But how many teachers are sincere? I see every student taking tuitions and why? Because what is taught in schools is not enough. And what about their health? My son already complains of backache,"" said the father who refused to give his name lest ""my ward is harassed and that is another issue, you cannot speak the truth"".

Robert Z Street, chairman of St John's Whitehall, sympathises with the children and their parents. ""The number of textbooks should be reduced and the children should instead take home story books. There is no benefit in giving excessive homework. Teaching and understanding should be in the classroom,"" he said.

Some parents feel there should be locker facilities. ""Heavy school bags are the problems for children... I strongly feel that schools should have some kind of arrangements to keep some of the workbooks in the class pigeonholes with locking facility,"" said a father.

Aaron Warjri, the principal of Shillong Government School, while welcoming the directive said children these days are ""overburdened by heavy schoolbags which may harm their bodies at a later age""."

""We go to their place and speak to their parents. The exercise helps us develop a contact with the parents and also see if students set aside enough time for studies at home,"" he said.

Recently, the school conducted a rangoli competition for students. It was unique because the students were told to draw the diagrams they study as part of their science syllabus. A student drew an image of the brain, nervous system, and respiratory system using colours provided by the teachers.

After school hours, students of classes 8, 9, and 10 have to take part in group studies. With the help of villagers, the school has got special benches on the campus for evening classes.

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

But when he got there, what he saw shocked him. The school was utterly dilapidated and Ramesh couldn't bear to see it in that condition.

Together with his father M Ramesh Babu and grandfather V Muthuraman, Krithik decided to start Empowering Rural India Foundation, a non-profit organisation, with the aim of uplifting government schools across the country.

But soon, Krithik realised that he did not have enough funds to take his vision forward. His folks suggested he look for sponsors.

Once he had the funds ready, Krithik approached the school management. Upon enquiring about the needs of the school, he was told that it faced occasional power outages, and the headmaster suggested that installation of solar panels would be of great help.

The family approached many solar service providers before finally zeroing in on a company, that two weeks ago, successfully managed to provide the school with the necessary infrastructure. With the installation of solar panels, the school can now easily save up to Rs 15,000 that otherwise was spent on electricity bills once in two months.

Interestingly, the solar panels can produce about 2kW of power, which is more than what the school needs. So, Krithik suggested that the school sell the excess power to the state electricity board.

On Saturday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had decided to reduce this to 1,600 square metres, with support of DDA members.

On August 27, a High Court bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had asked the DDA to complete all formalities with regard to the land in three months, and give possession to the Delhi government. It had asked that the government and various agencies cooperate for the development of a top-class Urdu medium school at the site of a vacated abattoir, which had earlier been earmarked for a parking lot.

On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that on September 12, Prakash convened a meeting without informing him, and that it was decided to reduce the size of the school to 1,600 square metres. ""They did so stating that 1,600 square metres is sufficient in accordance with CBSE's affiliation rules. They said children studying in classes XI and XII can be moved to other schools.

He further alleged that the matter was discussed in two DDA meetings -- one in September and one on Friday -- and that BJP members of the DDA supported ""commercial use"" of the land.

Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested. It is completely commercialised and parking is a matter of highest priority... It is not possible to comment on this issue as the facts are not before us, but school, parking, everything can be worked out in the space.

Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

Bringing tennis to Delhi government schools, five clay courts were inaugurated by Education Minister Manish Sisodia at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya No 2 in Punjabi Bagh Sunday. According to officials, the courts can be used by both private and government school students. Coaching, meanwhile, will be provided by Puneet Rawat, who runs tennis academy 'Tennis O Holic'. However, officials said, rackets and kits will be provided free of charge only to government school students.

""It is a core intervention in sports, where students from government schools can get the best coaching. Most of our schools are idle after hours, so this is the optimum utilisation of resources... Students from private schools can also avail the opportunity,"" said Sisodia.

Enrollment for coaching began two weeks ago. Around 180 students are from government schools, of which 140 are from Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya No. 2, and 13 are from private schools nearby. The children are aged between 8 and 12 years.

These courts are part of the Delhi government's initiative to involve various academies, clubs and trainers in the training of student sportspersons in government schools. Under the initiative, private academies can use the premises of government schools for commercial use. But they cannot charge fees from government school students, who must make up half the total number of children enrolled for training at the premises.

Apart from tennis, the private trainer-government school initiative has been extended to other sports such as volleyball, taekwondo, basketball, football, cricket, softball, boxing, kabbaddi, judo, hockey, and athletics among others.

The government is also starting its initiative, ""Play and Progress"", to provide financial assistance to ""upcoming school sportspersons"".

Eligible students -- who have lived in Delhi for the last three years or are regular students of any Delhi school for three years -- will receive financial support for nutrition, equipment, medical insurance and travel within the country, with a ceiling of Rs 2 lakh for students up to the age of 14 and Rs 3 lakh for those up to 17 years.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday inaugurated five tennis courts and a tennis academy at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya No. 2 in Punjabi Bagh as part of the Delhi government's policy that allows private academies to use the premises of schools run by the government.

These academies are given land for free and can use it commercially on two conditions -- half of all enrolments should be from Delhi government schools and that these students are not charged a fee.

Mr. Sisodia said the policy has received very enthusiastic response from organisations with expertise in sports training, and imparting art and cultural activities to children.

Stating that there should not be any difference in the quality of training, the Education Minister instructed the academy to ensure there is no segregation between students from surrounding areas and those from Delhi government schools.

He also asked the MLA and the school principal to explore the possibility of organising inter-school tournaments once the students are trained.

The Delhi government has also rolled out a 'Play and Progress' scheme to help talented sportspersons at the school-level hone their skills. Under the scheme, sportspersons under the age of 14 years are eligible to receive a quantum of assistance of ₹2 lakh per annum and ₹3 lakh for students in 14-17 years age bracket. The quantum of assistance can be enhanced by 20% in some cases.

Specialised training for these sportspersons is organised at 18 places, including Chhatrasal Stadium, Thyagaraj Sports Complex, East Vinod Nagar Sports Complex and Najafgarh Stadium.

Another scheme rolled out for established young sportspersons, called 'Mission Excellence', aims to see 100 top-level sportspersons of Delhi receive training and coaching sponsored by the government to prepare for international tournaments and championships.

Mr. Sisodia said that the problem with sports administration was that decision-making powers are held by those who have had no link with sports in their lives. ""The Delhi government has formed a special panel of experts with sportspersons to pick talented students, coaches and coaching techniques."""

However, reacting to the circular issued by the school on November 28, 2018, the directorate of education (DoE) has claimed that it has surplus funds of over Rs 2.5 crore. The DoE had ordered a rollback of the hike in fee, accusing the school of ""misuse of funds"".

The school says it was denied an opportunity to convey its stand and that it had increased the fee to meet the salary burden of the Seventh Pay Commission. It has moved court against the order.

In an order sent to the school in August 2018, the DoE said: ""The total funds available for the year 2017-18 amounts to Rs 20,16,52361 out of which cash outflow in the year 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 17,61,95435. This results in surplus funds amounting to Rs 2,54,56,926. In view of the examination, it is evident that the school is having sufficient funds to meet the financial implications for financial year 2017-18 after meeting its expenditure.""

DoE audited the school's finances after some parents complained to the deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.

The DoE has also accused the school of misusing the development fund collected from the students. The order says that under a provision in the Delhi School Education Rules of 1973 (DSER), ""schools can charge development fee not exceeding 15% of the tuition fee for purchase, upgradation (and) replacement of furniture fixture and equipment."" The order raised red flags on the purchase of desks and chairs and on the transport fee collected from students.

""The school is collecting transport fee from the students but (it's) not shown in the financial statements of the school till 2015-16,"" said the order. The government has also questioned the amount spent by the school on computers. ""The expenditure on purchase of computers in 2016-17 was Rs 28.73 lakh, in 2017-18 it was Rs 50 lakh and the proposed expenditure for 2018-19 is Rs 10 lakh.

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

The chief minister has issued strict instructions to show no laxity in the matter as the respect and dignity of the students could not be allowed to be compromised at any cost.

Singh has reiterated his government's commitment to providing a favourable environment for education and empowerment of girls.

The chief minister had on Friday ordered a probe into the allegations of stripping made by some of the students and their parents. The chief minister had also directed Secretary Education Krishan Kumar to complete the investigation by Monday and take further action if necessary.

The inquiry report said the students were checked twice on the directions and with full knowledge of the school principal and the teacher.

The girls were checked with their clothes on the first time and then the two women got them checked again by senior girl students of class 8 with their clothes taken off, as per the SDM Abohar, at whose office the statements of Kuldeep and Jyoti were recorded on Monday.

During the first checking, which was undertaken in the mid-day meal kitchen, Kaur was standing outside during the process, the inquiry committee members, District Education Officer Fazilka Kulwant Singh, Station House Officer Sadar Abohar Angrej Singh and District Child Protection Officer Fazilka Ritu, have stated in their report, the spokesperson said.

The committee unanimously agreed to the ""indifference and insensitivity"" towards women's physical dignity expressed by the school staff.

The report further said that though there may not have been any intent of physical/sexual assault, the teachers, at the outset, were found to be ""negligent and careless""."

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government about the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of its circular on ensuring safety of children in all the schools in the national capital.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao directed the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government to state in an affidavit the standard operating procedures laid down or instructions issued to implement the circular issued on August 11, 2018 and listed the matter for further hearing on January 24 next year.

The August 11 circular issued by DoE said that despite court orders and directions of DoE to the schools to carry out ""self inspection"" of the infrastructure and submit quarterly safety reports, there has only been ""half-hearted compliance"".

It also said that such ""half hearted approach"" would not work if the schools were serious about providing foolproof safety and security to the students.

The circular had suggested setting up of a school safety committee, holding monthly safety walks and submitting online safety reports to DoE and had warned of severe action, including withdrawal of recognition, against aided and recognised schools for repeated violation of the guidelines.

It had also warned of disciplinary action against the heads of the government-run schools for failure to follow the guidelines laid down in the circular.

The non-compliance of the circular was raised before the bench by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been appointed as amicus curiae by the court to inspect schools in the national capital and ascertain how safe and secure they are for the children studying there.

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

Delhi resident Dishant Sharma had written a letter to the High Court seeking framing of guidelines to make schools accountable for children's safety.

He has also sought police verification of the support staff in the schools, counselling of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras on school premises, separate washrooms for students and no direct access of support staff in the premises.

In his report submitted before the court, Aggarwal has said that he visited six schools in the national capital and found that they were overcrowded, lacked proper infrastructure, were not completely disabled friendly, toilets were in bad shape and drinking water was not properly available.

Apart from that the two complaint boxes set up inside the schools to be checked by the police and the school, were never ever opened, he said in his report."

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

""I wanted to join in a dance academy. But, due to my family's poor financial condition, I did not ask my parents to admit me in one,"" said Sujith.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts.

Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination. I have already filed an appeal in high court,"" he said. The case will be heard on October 19."

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

Close on the heels of accidents involving buses, in which a number of school children lost their lives and many others were injured, the state government on Wednesday banned school picnic buses from plying at night.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

The school has 144 students but does not have a single piece of furniture or boundary wall on one side, posing a security threat.

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

""We received money from the government and have disbursed it to different districts but issuing of tender and other such procedures may take time,"" said VS Rawat, additional director, elementary education."

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school. Now, Perumanallur government girls' high school was started in the abandoned building,"" he said.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school. The government has ordered to transfer 249 girls, between class VI and class X, from Perumanallur government higher secondary school to this school, which is now Perumanallur government girls' high school. After completion of half-yearly exam holidays, the school will start functioning on January 2,"" M Dhanabaggiam, headmistress of the new school told TOI.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

According to the plea, Desai's husband, Sameer, worked as a peon in the school and his post was an approved one with his salary being paid by the government. However, he died on November 2, 2011 and Samita was left with two minor children. On March 26, 2012, the school management decided to appoint her in place of her husband on compassionate grounds.

The school sent an application on August 7, 2012 to the education department to regularise Samita's job, which was refused on grounds that there was a ban on approving new staff since May 2, 2012. Thereafter, Samitai and the school approached the court.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The Qaumi Senior Secondary School used to operate from a five-storey building in Sarai Khalil, demolished in 1976 during the Emergency. Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested.

Facing criticism for failing to do a lot in primary education, the government has decided to introduce weekly tests in schools for students of classes 3-8. Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Confirming the same, state education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama said, ""We had got cent percent score in infrastructure but in learning outcomes, we lagged behind. This idea emerged from Mission Vidya, which was launched this year to focus on weak students in every class.

Students of a private school have lot of benefits as their parents are educated so they pay attention to their wards. Whereas the situation in government schools, city and rural, is bad as in many cases, parents are not educated so they are unable to pay attention to the children.""

Teachers, in several meetings in the past, have claimed that while they teach the syllabus properly, students do not understand. ""I wanted to end this cycle.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

Members of National Association of the Deaf (NAD) sat on dharna at New Delhi's Civil Lines on the occasion of World Disability Day on Monday over the social welfare department's ""refusal"" to vacate the premises of a school for deaf students. NAD said the Delhi government department is occupying the premises of Government Lady Noyce Senior Secondary School at Feroz Shah Kotla in the national capital for more than 10 years now and had been making false promises to move out.

NAD Executive Director Anuj Jain, through his sign language interpreter Shivoy Sharma, said: ""The Government Lady Noyce Senior Secondary School for the Deaf, which is grappling with space constraint with every classroom being in a decrepit state and packed more than its capacity, has seen its number dwindling ever since the social welfare department of the Delhi government encroached on its space. Many deaf students have had to be transferred to the school's branches in Kalkaji and Mayur Vihar, and some even have to be turned away at the time of admission owing to lack of space. The quality of education in the school is suffering with the government department squatting not only in classrooms but also the playground.""

Jain said the school, established in 1931, currently has 500 students; the number was around 1,500 before the social welfare department occupied school in 2003. He added: It is the deaf students among the disabled who are most exploited as they cannot really advocate for themselves.""

On Monday, nearly 3,000 protesters comprising activists from Delhi and National Capital Region, members of NAD, several NGOs, current and former students of the school were present at the dharna. Arman Ali, Executive Director, National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People, said: ""Hearing impaired children have very few options for education. If even that is taken away, it is infringement on their fundamental right to education. The Delhi government cannot remain indifferent when is comes to children with disabilities.""

Prior to this, NAD had organised a protest against the occupation of school on October 25 and met Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam, who promised action within a week. Gautam, however, did not keep his promise.

After that, the organisation also sent letters to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, on November 22 and 27, urging that the department be moved to Kingsway Camp or elsewhere.

Transport officials said they have written to the education department asking them to collect data of students enrolled in all city schools including public-private and details of the transport used by them. They have requested for the data by December end.

""We have written to the education department to collect data of schools, students, owned buses, and hired cabs to assess the total demand and supply of such vehicles in the city. Similar data will also be asked from municipal corporation-run schools. Once the data is collated and studied, a fresh scheme will be formulated to grant permits for school cabs with additional incentives,"" said, a senior Delhi government official.

The government's transport department has already sent a proposal in this regard to transport minister Kailash Gahlot. The decision was taken during a high-level meeting on Thursday.

Sanjay Goel, director, Directorate of Education (DoE), said, ""We are yet to receive an official communication in this regard. We will be ready to provide the data, as it will help regulate illegal vehicles ferrying school children.""

The move comes after an eight-year-old was killed in a school van accident in north Delhi earlier this week. The cab was plying without a permit as well as was ferrying above capacity, which are major violations.

Earlier this year, a seven-year-old was crushed to death while 17 others were injured in a similar accident. After this the government had announced it will bring changes to the existing School Cab Policy 2007, as it was ""outdated"".

Following the incident, the transport department has formed 20 teams of five members each for a month-long drive to crackdown on illegally plying school vans. The drive will begin from Saturday.

According to data available with the department, at least 25,000 such illegal cabs are plying as school vans in the city putting the lives of thousands of children at risk. Most of these vehicles have only private licenses and are required to get school van permits to ferry school children, under which they will have to follow guidelines mandated for children safety.

Besides, the official said, the department will also invite applications from cab operators to apply for valid permits.

""The applications for this purpose may be called in next fortnight. It is expected that illegal operators may seek permit during this window to avoid impounding of their vehicles,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi traffic police have already started a crackdown on these vans. At least 1,511 school vans have been prosecuted over the last three days by the traffic police.

""We have roped in the education department to help get the basic data to formulate a fresh policy and bring all school cabs under the legal ambit. Once the data is received, it will take around a month to prepare the new policy,"" said K K Dahiya, special commissioner (transport).

In 2017, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a meeting with Delhi Cabs Association, which was protesting against a crackdown on these vans, had given them time till January 2018 to get registered."

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

READ| Heavy backpacks leading to kids' back bone problems: Experts

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government about the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of its circular on ensuring safety of children in all the schools in the national capital.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao directed the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government to state in an affidavit the standard operating procedures laid down or instructions issued to implement the circular issued on August 11, 2018 and listed the matter for further hearing on January 24 next year.

The August 11 circular issued by DoE said that despite court orders and directions of DoE to the schools to carry out ""self inspection"" of the infrastructure and submit quarterly safety reports, there has only been ""half-hearted compliance"".

It also said that such ""half hearted approach"" would not work if the schools were serious about providing foolproof safety and security to the students.

The circular had suggested setting up of a school safety committee, holding monthly safety walks and submitting online safety reports to DoE and had warned of severe action, including withdrawal of recognition, against aided and recognised schools for repeated violation of the guidelines.

It had also warned of disciplinary action against the heads of the government-run schools for failure to follow the guidelines laid down in the circular.

The non-compliance of the circular was raised before the bench by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been appointed as amicus curiae by the court to inspect schools in the national capital and ascertain how safe and secure they are for the children studying there.

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

Delhi resident Dishant Sharma had written a letter to the High Court seeking framing of guidelines to make schools accountable for children's safety.

He has also sought police verification of the support staff in the schools, counselling of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras on school premises, separate washrooms for students and no direct access of support staff in the premises.

In his report submitted before the court, Aggarwal has said that he visited six schools in the national capital and found that they were overcrowded, lacked proper infrastructure, were not completely disabled friendly, toilets were in bad shape and drinking water was not properly available.

Apart from that the two complaint boxes set up inside the schools to be checked by the police and the school, were never ever opened, he said in his report."

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

He said that use of synthetic drug was even more dangerous and alarming and it was the need of the hour to make the Anti Drug Abuse a mass movement, only then the future of our country could be safe.

Jai Ram Thakur urged the students to say no to drugs and also motivate those involved in drug abuse to leave this vice otherwise life would leave him or her. The state government would make all out efforts to check out this social vice. He said that efforts would be made to make drug peddling a non bailable offence.

The Chief Minister also administered oath to the students to say no to drugs and check drug abuse.

Later, the Chief Minister on the occasion of Maharishi Balmiki Pragatosav visited Balmiki Temple at Solan and performed puja. He said that Maharishi Balmiki has immense contribution towards the mankind. He was not only the

creator of Balmiki Ramayana, but a great saint.

Hundreds of students from different educational institutions, youth and general people participated in the Anti Drug Rally.

Speaker of State Vidhan Sabha Dr. Rajiv Bindal while addressing the Anti Drug Rally said that organising this rally in the historic Thodo Ground shows the commitment of the state government to make our society drug free. He said that it becomes the duty of each one of us to supplement the efforts of the state government to root out this vice from the society.

Social Justice and Empowerment Minister Dr. Rajiv Saizal said that the endeavour of the Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur was to make Himachal Pradesh Drug Free State. He said that to achieve the goal collective efforts were required, as life was precious and demon of the drug abuse must be killed.

Member of Parliament Virender Kashyap said that Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur was committed to eradicate the menace of drug abuse from the state and for this the government has taken major steps.

He said that the endeavour of the state government was to make Himachal Pradesh a 'Dev Bhoomi' in real sense and it becomes the social responsibility of each one of us to eradicate this vice from the society.

Dr. Virender Mohan, a renowned physician from the area, said that especially the age group of twelve to eighteen years were highly vulnerable to the drug abuse.

This may be due to the peer pressure or some other factor. He said that the teachers and parents must also keep an eye on the behavioural change among children. Any abnormal behaviour should be taken seriously.

To cater to the needs of tribal students in Periyur, Agnipavi, Sengulam, Kovil Natham and Sundaipodu hamlets in the hills, the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare started a primary school at Kongadai in 1993 that was later upgraded into middle school in 1998.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

When contacted, officials at the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare said that proposals have already been submitted to the State government and the government order for posting teachers is expected soon."

The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts. The stand taken by the sate that a number of similarly situated persons are still awaiting regularisation of their services for want of vacancies, cannot be accepted as gospel truth,"" the order reads. Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination. I have already filed an appeal in high court,"" he said. The case will be heard on October 19."

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

Close on the heels of accidents involving buses, in which a number of school children lost their lives and many others were injured, the state government on Wednesday banned school picnic buses from plying at night.

Eight children from Surat were killed and several others were injured when a private bus they were travelling in fell into a 300-feet deep gorge in Dangs on Saturday night. They had gone to Dangs for a picnic. In another incident, a bus conductor died and 24 children of a school in Ahmedabad were injured when their bus rammed into a tree in Godhra in the wee hours of Tuesday.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters that the decision had been taken during the weekly meeting of the state cabinet, presided over by chief minister Vijay Rupani.

""Our government has decided to impose a ban on buses with school children from plying between 11pm and 6am to avoid accidents such as these in the future,"" Patel said.

""The bus operators will be required to stop the journey during night time. They will also have to make lodging and boarding arrangements for children,"" he further added.

Chief secretary Dr JN Singh said, ""The issue was discussed with utter sincerity in the cabinet.

Farmers in Gorai and Tamautiya villages of Aligarh were forced to lock up the cows as several acres of farmlands have been destroyed by the bovines, left stray by their owners after they no longer yielded milk. Cow Slaughter, Banned by UP CM Yogi Adityanath, Creates Bovine Menace in State.

Speaking to reporters, the local farmers in Tamautiya said they are forced to remain awake throughout the nights in their fields to prevent the stray cattle from eating the the near-ready to harvest crops.

The number of bovines have multiplied exponentially over the past couple of years, since the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP was elected to power. The state government has rigorously enforced a ban on the slaughter of cows and cow progeny.

Apart from the government-enforced ban, vigilantes affiliated to some right-wing groups have been involved in attacks on cattle traders -- which has forced many of them to abandon their animals.

The incident on Tuesday in Aligarh led to a brief law and order violation as well, as the police team which arrived to free the cattle and take them to the nearest gaushala faced protests, including stone-pelting. The demonstrators were mobilised through a WhatsApp rumour claiming that the cows are being sent for slaughter.

The situation was brought under control, said said senior police officer Ajay Kumar Sahni, adding that four miscreants have been arrested."

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

But when he got there, what he saw shocked him. The school was utterly dilapidated and Ramesh couldn't bear to see it in that condition.

Together with his father M Ramesh Babu and grandfather V Muthuraman, Krithik decided to start Empowering Rural India Foundation, a non-profit organisation, with the aim of uplifting government schools across the country.

But soon, Krithik realised that he did not have enough funds to take his vision forward. His folks suggested he look for sponsors.

Once he had the funds ready, Krithik approached the school management. Upon enquiring about the needs of the school, he was told that it faced occasional power outages, and the headmaster suggested that installation of solar panels would be of great help.

The family approached many solar service providers before finally zeroing in on a company, that two weeks ago, successfully managed to provide the school with the necessary infrastructure. With the installation of solar panels, the school can now easily save up to Rs 15,000 that otherwise was spent on electricity bills once in two months.

Interestingly, the solar panels can produce about 2kW of power, which is more than what the school needs. So, Krithik suggested that the school sell the excess power to the state electricity board.

On Saturday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had decided to reduce this to 1,600 square metres, with support of DDA members.

On August 27, a High Court bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had asked the DDA to complete all formalities with regard to the land in three months, and give possession to the Delhi government. It had asked that the government and various agencies cooperate for the development of a top-class Urdu medium school at the site of a vacated abattoir, which had earlier been earmarked for a parking lot.

On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that on September 12, Prakash convened a meeting without informing him, and that it was decided to reduce the size of the school to 1,600 square metres. ""They did so stating that 1,600 square metres is sufficient in accordance with CBSE's affiliation rules. They said children studying in classes XI and XII can be moved to other schools.

He further alleged that the matter was discussed in two DDA meetings -- one in September and one on Friday -- and that BJP members of the DDA supported ""commercial use"" of the land.

The Qaumi Senior Secondary School used to operate from a five-storey building in Sarai Khalil, demolished in 1976 during the Emergency. Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested. It is completely commercialised and parking is a matter of highest priority... It is not possible to comment on this issue as the facts are not before us, but school, parking, everything can be worked out in the space.

Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

However, reacting to the circular issued by the school on November 28, 2018, the directorate of education (DoE) has claimed that it has surplus funds of over Rs 2.5 crore. The DoE had ordered a rollback of the hike in fee, accusing the school of ""misuse of funds"".

The school says it was denied an opportunity to convey its stand and that it had increased the fee to meet the salary burden of the Seventh Pay Commission. It has moved court against the order.

In an order sent to the school in August 2018, the DoE said: ""The total funds available for the year 2017-18 amounts to Rs 20,16,52361 out of which cash outflow in the year 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 17,61,95435. This results in surplus funds amounting to Rs 2,54,56,926. In view of the examination, it is evident that the school is having sufficient funds to meet the financial implications for financial year 2017-18 after meeting its expenditure.""

DoE audited the school's finances after some parents complained to the deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.

The DoE has also accused the school of misusing the development fund collected from the students. The order says that under a provision in the Delhi School Education Rules of 1973 (DSER), ""schools can charge development fee not exceeding 15% of the tuition fee for purchase, upgradation (and) replacement of furniture fixture and equipment."" The order raised red flags on the purchase of desks and chairs and on the transport fee collected from students.

""The school is collecting transport fee from the students but (it's) not shown in the financial statements of the school till 2015-16,"" said the order. The government has also questioned the amount spent by the school on computers. ""The expenditure on purchase of computers in 2016-17 was Rs 28.73 lakh, in 2017-18 it was Rs 50 lakh and the proposed expenditure for 2018-19 is Rs 10 lakh. A computer is a capital asset and lasts for many years. So much expenditure incurred every year (does) not appear to be correct,"" said the order.

""All the observations in the order are one-sided,"" protested principal Suman Kumar. ""No opportunity was given by the DoE to the school to clarify its stand...For example, the fact that today computers are central to education and need rapid upgradation has been ignored. Phased purchase by the school against a strength of about 1,900 students has been perceived as misutilisation. The stock can be verified. The buffer of Rs 2.5 crore worked out by the DoE is based on erroneous omission of accounting facts on record.""

""Similarly with regard to the transport fee, a separate account was maintained...as per the guidelines of the DoE issued in the past. There has been no misutilisation of the development fee,"" the principal added."

The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

""We have written to the education department to collect data of schools, students, owned buses, and hired cabs to assess the total demand and supply of such vehicles in the city.

Sanjay Goel, director, Directorate of Education (DoE), said, ""We are yet to receive an official communication in this regard. We will be ready to provide the data, as it will help regulate illegal vehicles ferrying school children.""

The move comes after an eight-year-old was killed in a school van accident in north Delhi earlier this week. The cab was plying without a permit as well as was ferrying above capacity, which are major violations.

Earlier this year, a seven-year-old was crushed to death while 17 others were injured in a similar accident. After this the government had announced it will bring changes to the existing School Cab Policy 2007, as it was ""outdated"".

Following the incident, the transport department has formed 20 teams of five members each for a month-long drive to crackdown on illegally plying school vans. The drive will begin from Saturday.

According to data available with the department, at least 25,000 such illegal cabs are plying as school vans in the city putting the lives of thousands of children at risk. Most of these vehicles have only private licenses and are required to get school van permits to ferry school children, under which they will have to follow guidelines mandated for children safety.

Besides, the official said, the department will also invite applications from cab operators to apply for valid permits.

""The applications for this purpose may be called in next fortnight. It is expected that illegal operators may seek permit during this window to avoid impounding of their vehicles,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi traffic police have already started a crackdown on these vans. At least 1,511 school vans have been prosecuted over the last three days by the traffic police.

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

As a first step, Mukundh Balajee, a Class XII student at National Public school in Koramangala, Bengaluru, has adopted a government higher secondary school at a village in his native Tiruvannamalai.

Mukundh founded the NGO 'Gramin Shiksha' with the help of his parents in June 2017. His father Balajee Subramaniyan whose family owns the Essae Group of Companies had assured to back his son's move.

Mukundh told TOI, ""The aim of opening the organisation was to help rural schools in Karnataka where we are settled. But a TOI article in September 'Fund crunch may force TN government to close down 3,000 schools' shocked me. After that, I held a discussion with my family and decided to adopt the school.""

School headmaster R Karunanithi said the school has 285 students -- including 133 boys and 152 girls.

Through Gramin Shiksha, Mukundh opted to contribute and setup a smart class room at a cost of 1.5 lakhs.

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

""I wanted to join in a dance academy. But, due to my family's poor financial condition, I did not ask my parents to admit me in one,"" said Sujith.

""The first dance that I choreographed on my own was when I was in Class VII for a school programme,"" he said. ""It gave me happiness when teachers and students appreciated my dancing style,"" he added. He has mastered western and folk dance.

To cater to the needs of tribal students in Periyur, Agnipavi, Sengulam, Kovil Natham and Sundaipodu hamlets in the hills, the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare started a primary school at Kongadai in 1993 that was later upgraded into middle school in 1998.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination. I have already filed an appeal in high court,"" he said. The case will be heard on October 19."

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

In the second one, one person was killed and two dozen children were injured when the bus, returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh, met with an accident near Godhra.

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said. Teachers will be taught to induce among students the habit of practising yoga to prevent obesity. The teachers in turn will teach the students, he said.

""The lessons will explain the necessity of regularly monitoring certain parameters like blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight. The first two factors have an intimate relation with obesity.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

The school sent an application on August 7, 2012 to the education department to regularise Samita's job, which was refused on grounds that there was a ban on approving new staff since May 2, 2012. Thereafter, Samitai and the school approached the court.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored.

Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

Navonil has written to the headmaster of his school that he will donate his entire scholarship money, a sum of Rs 24,000, to the school library so that students from poor families like his don't have to beg for books.

The elder among two sons of a man who runs the family by making photocopies of documents with an old machine and selling crops grown on a small patch of ancestral land, Navonil does not enjoy the luxury of having anything in plenty. His younger brother is a class 6 student.

Yet, the class 10 student from Badalpur Bidya Bhaban High School, from where he will appear for secondary examination next year, is ready to donate the money he received from the Union ministry of human resource development last month. He wants the state government-aided school to have a well-stocked library.

In 2016, when Navonil was in class 8, he appeared for the National Means cum Merit Scholarship, (NMMSS). The examination was launched in 2008 to award scholarships to meritorious students from economically backward sections. This was done to reduce drop-out rate at class 8 level. Navonil received the money last month.

""My grandfather always talked about helping people in need. I am paying homage to his memory,"" said Navonil. His father, forty-five-year old Debabrata Das, is the sole bread earner in the family.

""Navonil is a meritorious student. We are aware of his father's financial condition. We never imagined that he would decide to donate the money. We feel proud of him,"" Subodh Kumar Karan, head master of the school, said.

Badalpur Bidya Bhaban High School was set up in 1969. It has around 500 students and 11 teachers. The library has around 1500 books. The school authorities have decided to accept the donation from Navonil.

Debabrata Das has also welcomed his son's decision. ""My father did a lot to educate people in our village. I know that my son needs the money for his studies but he has my support,"" he said.

Navonil's teachers said they will help the teenager if he ever faces any problem."

It becomes even more dangerous during the monsoon and the school administration has propped up wooden poles on the verandah fearing an imminent crash of the roof.

The school has over 800 children on its rolls studying from classes VI to XII.

While the students from classes VI to X are accommodated in a new block, 500 children of Plus One and Plus Two attend classes in the South Block. The school has another Thendral block, which is in a good condition. But the block is used by the Kasturba Gandhi Government College for Women.

The South Block was constructed in the 1970s and all the 14 classrooms and labs for physics, chemistry and biology used by students of classes XI and XII have developed cracks on the ceiling and the roofs are leaking owing to lack of maintenance.

A teacher, on condition anonymity, said some repair works were taken up by a contractor to the south block in 2016.

""A few girders on the verandah were replaced. However, the work was suspended subsequently for want of funds,"" said the teacher.

These academies are given land for free and can use it commercially on two conditions -- half of all enrolments should be from Delhi government schools and that these students are not charged a fee.

Mr. Sisodia said the policy has received very enthusiastic response from organisations with expertise in sports training, and imparting art and cultural activities to children.

Stating that there should not be any difference in the quality of training, the Education Minister instructed the academy to ensure there is no segregation between students from surrounding areas and those from Delhi government schools.

He also asked the MLA and the school principal to explore the possibility of organising inter-school tournaments once the students are trained.

The Delhi government has also rolled out a 'Play and Progress' scheme to help talented sportspersons at the school-level hone their skills. Under the scheme, sportspersons under the age of 14 years are eligible to receive a quantum of assistance of ₹2 lakh per annum and ₹3 lakh for students in 14-17 years age bracket. The quantum of assistance can be enhanced by 20% in some cases.

Specialised training for these sportspersons is organised at 18 places, including Chhatrasal Stadium, Thyagaraj Sports Complex, East Vinod Nagar Sports Complex and Najafgarh Stadium.

Another scheme rolled out for established young sportspersons, called 'Mission Excellence', aims to see 100 top-level sportspersons of Delhi receive training and coaching sponsored by the government to prepare for international tournaments and championships.

Mr. Sisodia said that the problem with sports administration was that decision-making powers are held by those who have had no link with sports in their lives.

However, reacting to the circular issued by the school on November 28, 2018, the directorate of education (DoE) has claimed that it has surplus funds of over Rs 2.5 crore. The DoE had ordered a rollback of the hike in fee, accusing the school of ""misuse of funds"".

The school says it was denied an opportunity to convey its stand and that it had increased the fee to meet the salary burden of the Seventh Pay Commission. It has moved court against the order.

In an order sent to the school in August 2018, the DoE said: ""The total funds available for the year 2017-18 amounts to Rs 20,16,52361 out of which cash outflow in the year 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 17,61,95435.

DoE audited the school's finances after some parents complained to the deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.

""The expenditure on purchase of computers in 2016-17 was Rs 28.73 lakh, in 2017-18 it was Rs 50 lakh and the proposed expenditure for 2018-19 is Rs 10 lakh.

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

READ| Heavy backpacks leading to kids' back bone problems: Experts

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

The aim is to take international films to students in every nook and corner of the state. ""The festival curation team has zeroed in on the films to be screened in over three sessions. Private schools will host the festival for over four days,"" added Syed Sultan Ahmed, managing director, LXL Ideas Private Ltd, which will screen the films along with the education department.

The firm approached both private and government schools to screen children's films selected from global festivals. Stating that the response was encouraging, Ahmed said: ""Do children from far-off districts ever get to go to international film festivals? We want to take the world's best children's movies to their schools. Language is no barrier in children's films and there are English subtitles anyway.""

The organisers have picked 100 films from 30 countries in 20 languages; the duration varies from 2 minutes to 20 minutes."

The orders were issued on Monday night after Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh received an inquiry report, which found the incident to be a case of ""gross negligence, indifference and insensitivity"" on the part of the teachers of the school, he said.

School headmaster Kuldeep Kaur and teacher Jyoti have been suspended on the directives of the chief minister, the spokesperson said. A charge sheet will also be issued under Rule 8 of the Conduct Rules against Kaur and Jyoti, who have been placed under suspension, he said.

The incident, which came to light last week, was brought to the chief minister's notice after a video showed students crying and complaining that they had been stripped by the teachers in the school premises. The teachers were reportedly trying to find out who was wearing a sanitary pad, after a soiled one was found in the school toilet.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government about the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of its circular on ensuring safety of children in all the schools in the national capital.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao directed the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government to state in an affidavit the standard operating procedures laid down or instructions issued to implement the circular issued on August 11, 2018 and listed the matter for further hearing on January 24 next year.

The August 11 circular issued by DoE said that despite court orders and directions of DoE to the schools to carry out ""self inspection"" of the infrastructure and submit quarterly safety reports, there has only been ""half-hearted compliance"".

It also said that such ""half hearted approach"" would not work if the schools were serious about providing foolproof safety and security to the students.

The circular had suggested setting up of a school safety committee, holding monthly safety walks and submitting online safety reports to DoE and had warned of severe action, including withdrawal of recognition, against aided and recognised schools for repeated violation of the guidelines.

It had also warned of disciplinary action against the heads of the government-run schools for failure to follow the guidelines laid down in the circular.

The non-compliance of the circular was raised before the bench by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been appointed as amicus curiae by the court to inspect schools in the national capital and ascertain how safe and secure they are for the children studying there.

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

Delhi resident Dishant Sharma had written a letter to the High Court seeking framing of guidelines to make schools accountable for children's safety.

He has also sought police verification of the support staff in the schools, counselling of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras on school premises, separate washrooms for students and no direct access of support staff in the premises.

In his report submitted before the court, Aggarwal has said that he visited six schools in the national capital and found that they were overcrowded, lacked proper infrastructure, were not completely disabled friendly, toilets were in bad shape and drinking water was not properly available.

Apart from that the two complaint boxes set up inside the schools to be checked by the police and the school, were never ever opened, he said in his report."

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts. The stand taken by the sate that a number of similarly situated persons are still awaiting regularisation of their services for want of vacancies, cannot be accepted as gospel truth,"" the order reads. Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

Advocate Charanpal Singh Bagri told The Indian Express on Thursday that they were waiting for the verdict since July as the court had reserved it and it was made available on Wednesday."

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination. I have already filed an appeal in high court,"" he said. The case will be heard on October 19."

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

Rural Development Ministry data shows access to highest level of school education remains a concern, only 6.57 per cent villages have up to senior secondary schools.

New Delhi: Over 14 per cent of villages in India don't have schools, while as many as 10 states in the country have over 15 per cent such villages, shows the latest data available with the Rural Development Ministry.

Collected under Mission Antyodaya, the data also shows that around 47 per cent villages have schools only up to the primary level.

The comprehensive data, an assessment of village-level infrastructure facilities and amenities across states and Union Territories, is currently available for 5,27,507 villages and 2.3 lakh gram panchayats.

Apart from the 75,613 (14.33 per cent) villages that don't have schools, data shows 21 per cent villages have up to middle level schools (Classes 6 to 8), around 11 per cent have up to high schools (Classes 9 and 10) and only 6.57 per cent have up to senior secondary schools (Classes 11 and 12).

The ministry's aim behind collecting village-wise data is to identify gaps in villages based on the set parameters to ensure targeted development and execution of schemes.

Ten states -- Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Manipur, Goa, Odisha, Uttarakhand, Arunachal Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh -- are worse off than the national average, with over 15 per cent villages reporting no school at all.

Mizoram, Kerala and Gujarat, meanwhile, have less than 2 per cent villages with no schools.

Kerala also does exceedingly well with respect to higher education, with senior secondary schools available in as many as 80 per cent villages, and 11 per cent villages reporting at least up to high school level. This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

In fact, measurement of blood pressure, blood sugar and body weight should be regularly done among school students, he said.

""The instruments for measuring these parameters will be bought by the schools from funds provided by the department, mainly meant for this purpose,"" he said.

The department has already purchased sphygmomanometer and stethoscope for measuring blood pressure, he stated.

Weighing machines, skinfold callipers for determining state of obesity and glucometer for measuring blood sugar have also been purchased, he said. ""The teachers will be trained by physicians in handling the instruments. They will also be taught about the impact of blood pressure, blood sugar and how obesity can be controlled or prevented through controlling food habits and regular exercising,"" he said.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

The administrative work of the school is managed by a teacher as it doesn't have a principal. The former principal passed away in 2017 and no appointment was made since then.

This is one among several schools in the state that are struggling without basic necessities.

State education minister Arvind Pandey has been pushing for better facilities for students in government schools, but they are still a distant dream for many schools in the state.

According to the education department data for 2017-2018, out of 1,412 schools in Dehradun, 649 schools do not have a playground, 329 schools do not have ramp facilities or boundary walls, and fencing is missing in 117 schools.

Sunita Rawat, the teacher in charge of the primary school in Raipur, said: ""We got ~50,000 from the department this month and we will use it to repair the floors and toilets. We never had furniture in the school and students have been sitting on mats only.""

She also added that even the neighbouring schools don't have such facilities and they ""never asked the department especially for furniture"".

Another teacher said on condition of anonymity: ""We requested the department to release funds for repairing the boundary wall many times as it is a worry if any child sneaks out through the broken part of the wall.""

SB Joshi, chief education officer of Dehradun, said: ""There are over 1,000 schools in the district and we are trying to provide furniture to all. Till then, jute mats and carpets are provided for students to sit on.""

The department of school education sanctioned Rs 10 crore in November to all 13 districts for buying furniture for government schools.

After it was 'abandoned' a decade ago, the school had become a den for anti-social elements to play cards, booze and indulge in prostitution.

The state government has recently passed an order to start a government girls' high school in the building, which was inaugurated last week by the state school education minister K A Sengottaiyan.

The school was started in 1957 in a tile-roof building at Perumanallur. It was upgraded as government higher secondary school. When the strength increased, lack of infrastructure in the school became an issue. So, the students were shifted to a higher secondary school functioning on Kanakkampalayam Road, around 10 years ago. But the old school building was 'abandoned'.

""Especially women would fear to go near the school building because of the anti-social elements. Apart from the prostitution activities, many college students would camp in the dilapidated classrooms and involve in gambling. Despite continuous complaints, numerous incidents were happening in the school building. A few months ago, a class VIII girl was allegedly molested,"" said P Mouleeswaran, secretary, alumni association of the school.

""After our continuous requests to restart the school, the school education minister Sengottaiyan visited the abandoned school building. Quickly, the government passed an order to divide Perumanallur government higher secondary school, among four other government schools in the state, and separate the girl students from the school.

""A group of alumni of the school has come forward and helped to restore the buildings and established a smart classroom. With 10 classrooms, a well-furnished toilet facility, equipped with sanitary napkin incinerator. The alumni have, so far, spent, more than Rs 40 lakh,"" said Mouleeswaran, the 1981-batch student.

""It is commendable that the alumni were putting their hearts out in reviving the school.

A division bench of Justices S.C. Dharmadhikari and Bharati Dangre was hearing the petition filed by Samita Desai seeking directions to the state to regularise her post. The petition also sought directions to the state to pay her the dues accrued to her while working as a peon in the school.

Public prosecutor, Shruti Vyas, argued that there was a ban on approvals and the post had not been sanctioned as per the 2013-14 staffing pattern for the school.

The court, however, rejected the contentions and stated that Samita's appointment was done as per a December 2, 2002 state order which superseded the 2012 ban."

DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

A student, Madhurima Paul, has started a petition on change.org, 'Join hands to recognise Mount Carmel Dwarka', which has so far been signed by over 4,000 people. ""Considering the idea of graduating from a great school, which is just officially de-recognised, it is the value of the students' degree at stake. It is our admission in colleges at stake.... What really concerns me as a student is just that one parameter cannot and should not make the entire school shut down,"" Paul said in the petition addressed to Kejriwal and Sisodia. She has requsted that the school be recognised again.

On the note sent on December 11, the school said, ""We thank you for your continued support and trust in Mount Carmel. If you wish to extend your support, kindly send your emails with a copy to us addressed to chief minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.

The school claimed that it had received the notice, to be effective from April 1, 2019, on the same day. The government ""further instructed that no fresh admission to be taken. This information was made available to media almost a week ago and like many of you, we were greatly shocked and disappointed after reading the newspaper headlines"", said the note, which was signed by principal Sunita Howell.

The school said some parents had complained to DoE against the fixing of fees for the academic year 2016-17. ""So in the directorate's words, 'in the interest of parents and students the school has been de-recognised',"" said the note. According to DoE, the school had increased the fees without the prior approval of the authority.

On Saturday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had decided to reduce this to 1,600 square metres, with support of DDA members.

On August 27, a High Court bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had asked the DDA to complete all formalities with regard to the land in three months, and give possession to the Delhi government. It had asked that the government and various agencies cooperate for the development of a top-class Urdu medium school at the site of a vacated abattoir, which had earlier been earmarked for a parking lot.

On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that on September 12, Prakash convened a meeting without informing him, and that it was decided to reduce the size of the school to 1,600 square metres. ""They did so stating that 1,600 square metres is sufficient in accordance with CBSE's affiliation rules. They said children studying in classes XI and XII can be moved to other schools. However, that is irrelevant as according to the 2021 Delhi Master Plan, 4,000 square metres is the minimum area to set up a school -- which was promised at the HC for a senior secondary school,"" alleged Sisodia.

He further alleged that the matter was discussed in two DDA meetings -- one in September and one on Friday -- and that BJP members of the DDA supported ""commercial use"" of the land.

The Qaumi Senior Secondary School used to operate from a five-storey building in Sarai Khalil, demolished in 1976 during the Emergency. Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested. It is completely commercialised and parking is a matter of highest priority... It is not possible to comment on this issue as the facts are not before us, but school, parking, everything can be worked out in the space. Anyway, the Delhi government has so much land for constructing schools and does not do so.""

Firoz Bhakt, in response to whose petition the HC had passed its order, said he has no option but to move court once again. ""This is unethical and illegal. The three-month period given by the court has lapsed and the land grant has not moved forward. Instead of reducing, they should have been considering alloting more land so a playground can be developed for the school."""

Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

The DoE, however, said the March 9, 2000 allotment letter for the land given to the school showed it had been given the property at a concessional rate.

The school had also argued that being a minority institution it was exempt from the requirement of prior approval for increasing fees, but the DoE said the Supreme Court and High Court orders cited were about EWS admissions in minority schools, not fees."

The situation can be gauged from the fact that the school misses extra-curricular activities to avoid any mishap because of no boundary wall and even during the recess time, the students are asked to take extra caution by remaining confined to safer area.

Transport officials said they have written to the education department asking them to collect data of students enrolled in all city schools including public-private and details of the transport used by them. They have requested for the data by December end.

""We have written to the education department to collect data of schools, students, owned buses, and hired cabs to assess the total demand and supply of such vehicles in the city. Similar data will also be asked from municipal corporation-run schools. Once the data is collated and studied, a fresh scheme will be formulated to grant permits for school cabs with additional incentives,"" said, a senior Delhi government official.

The government's transport department has already sent a proposal in this regard to transport minister Kailash Gahlot. The decision was taken during a high-level meeting on Thursday.

Sanjay Goel, director, Directorate of Education (DoE), said, ""We are yet to receive an official communication in this regard. We will be ready to provide the data, as it will help regulate illegal vehicles ferrying school children.""

The move comes after an eight-year-old was killed in a school van accident in north Delhi earlier this week. The cab was plying without a permit as well as was ferrying above capacity, which are major violations.

Earlier this year, a seven-year-old was crushed to death while 17 others were injured in a similar accident. After this the government had announced it will bring changes to the existing School Cab Policy 2007, as it was ""outdated"".

Following the incident, the transport department has formed 20 teams of five members each for a month-long drive to crackdown on illegally plying school vans. The drive will begin from Saturday.

According to data available with the department, at least 25,000 such illegal cabs are plying as school vans in the city putting the lives of thousands of children at risk. Most of these vehicles have only private licenses and are required to get school van permits to ferry school children, under which they will have to follow guidelines mandated for children safety.

Besides, the official said, the department will also invite applications from cab operators to apply for valid permits.

""The applications for this purpose may be called in next fortnight. It is expected that illegal operators may seek permit during this window to avoid impounding of their vehicles,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi traffic police have already started a crackdown on these vans. At least 1,511 school vans have been prosecuted over the last three days by the traffic police.

""We have roped in the education department to help get the basic data to formulate a fresh policy and bring all school cabs under the legal ambit. Once the data is received, it will take around a month to prepare the new policy,"" said K K Dahiya, special commissioner (transport).

Fifth-grader Tushar Mehta walks gingerly with his overwhelmingly heavy bag, from his home to his school in Jhandewalan. It's a two-km daily drag for the little kid.

""We're forced to carry all textbooks and notebooks. If we miss anything, we get wooden scale slaps or have to stand outside the classroom for the whole period,"" he said, with sadness in his eyes and sharp pain in his tiny shoulders.

This is the story of most schoolchildren in Delhi-NCR. While the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) asked all states and Union Territories (UTs) on Monday to regulate the weight of school bags, a Mail Today reality check with a weighing machine showed this is going to be a daunting task as children remain crushed by the heavy bags they carry. Most bags weighed double the limit prescribed by the government. Many small kids were seen carrying even 10-kg bags. Those in classes III and IV were the worst suffers.

READ| Heavy backpacks leading to kids' back bone problems: Experts

As per the government circular, the weight of schoolbags for students of classes I and II should not exceed 1.5 kg, while those of students of class III to V should weigh between 2 kg to 3 kg. Schoolbags of students of classes VI and VII should not be more than 4 kg, while the weight of schoolbags of classes VIII and IX students should not be above 4.5 kg. The schoolbag of a class X student should not weigh above 5 kg.

But the reality is painful, and it will take some doing before the burden can actually be reduced. Shruti Desai, a class III student of a private school in Mayur Vihar, carries a 5 kg bag. Her mother, Kavita Desai, said nothing much can be done. ""Kids carry only what they are asked to. They have five subjects. Each subject has three books. There are computer and art books. Plus, there are notebooks. Teachers can ask for anything,"" she said.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

Many luminaries of Odia literature like Mayadhar Mansingh and Rajkishore Ray were a part of its teaching faculty.

However, for a school with such glorious past, its premises is dotted with government offices hampering education of the students.The present building of the school was constructed in 1936 by the then chief engineer of Kalahandi Indramani Kar, who was an alumni of the school. It was considered one of the best in the State but after 1970s, performance of the school started declining due to negligence of the authorities.

The school was initially spread over an area of about 10 acres. Although playground is considered a mandatory component of a school, Brajamohan High School currently does not have one. Unfortunately till 2017, the land was not recorded in name of the school by the State Government. In 2004-05, playground of the school was used for setting up the Town Planning office and Kalahandi Judicial Complex. After an outcry by alumnus, the Government recorded 6.66 acres of land in favour of the school on June 17, 2017.

This apart, many Government offices have come up on the school premises and this has been hampering the ambience. The District Education Office has been occupying a substantial portion of the school for the last 30 years. The 4(O) Naval unit of NCC currently functions from the hostel building of the school and another building of the school is occupied by Rashtriya Madhyamik Shikya Abhiyan office. The offices are frequented by a lot of visitors and this affects education of the students.

While Plus Two course has been merged with school education in other parts of the district, this has not been done here. Last year, the Government decided to open Plus Two course in all high schools but no such provision has been made in this school. Sources said to start the course, the offices need to be shifted and it seems difficult at this moment. District Inspector of Schools, Sanjiv Singh said since the District Education Office has no building of its own, it is functioning from the high school campus but no permanent land of the school has been allotted to the office. He assured to write to the School and Mass Education Department to allot permanent land for the office so that the land under its occupation can be given back to the school."

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

A Class XII student of government higher secondary school at Karamadai, Sujith is not a professional dancer. Nor did he undergo any proper training.

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

""I wanted to join in a dance academy. But, due to my family's poor financial condition, I did not ask my parents to admit me in one,"" said Sujith.

""The first dance that I choreographed on my own was when I was in Class VII for a school programme,"" he said. ""It gave me happiness when teachers and students appreciated my dancing style,"" he added. He has mastered western and folk dance.

""It is my ambition to become a professional dancer. But my parents want me to get a degree and join in a job,"" he said, expressing his hopes that they will eventually understand what dance actually means to him.

He said he is planning to do automobile engineering to make his parents happy but will never stop dancing."

To cater to the needs of tribal students in Periyur, Agnipavi, Sengulam, Kovil Natham and Sundaipodu hamlets in the hills, the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare started a primary school at Kongadai in 1993 that was later upgraded into middle school in 1998.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

When contacted, officials at the Department of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare said that proposals have already been submitted to the State government and the government order for posting teachers is expected soon."

The PUNJAB and Haryana High Court has ordered regularisation of services of an 84-year-old woman at a Punjab government school. The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts. The stand taken by the sate that a number of similarly situated persons are still awaiting regularisation of their services for want of vacancies, cannot be accepted as gospel truth,"" the order reads. Shanti's salary at present is Rs 2,250 per month and till 2012 it was only Rs 1,850 per month.

With the subway that is built between Irugur town and the school where a four-line railway track runs through remaining unusable, students are forced to cross the track to reach the school daily.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely. ""Presently, students have to walk a long distance to reach the school, if they are not crossing the railway track. Once the subway is ready for use, they have to walk just 200 metres.""

Presently, school teachers make sure that students cross the tracks safely every morning and evening, said headmaster P Krishnasamy. He said the students, who are afraid to cross the tracks, have to walk around 1.5km to use a rail over-bridge, which doesn't have a pedestrian walkway, posing danger from speeding vehicles. ""We had made several representations to officials of district administration, school education and highways departments about the pending work, but to no avail.""

The school earlier had 1,200 students, but the strength has come down to 700 as parents have shifted their wards to other schools, taking the risky commute into account.

Students, mobilised by the Student' Federation of India, staged a protest in front of the school on Tuesday morning. Subsequently, national highways department officials held talks with parents and school authorities.

When contacted, a national highways department official, who participated in the talks, said the work would be completed in two months. The official said the work to lay service roads to approach the subway was not done due to insufficient funds. ""Now, we have called for tenders for the work.""

The railways department had completed the subway work in April 2017, the official said. ""We have acquired revised administrative sanction for the cost layout and would finish the work in two months."""

The teacher, now out on bail, continued to teach at the school despite concerns raised by its principal who has pursued the case since 2013 when the harassment charges were registered.

In August 2018, a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act court convicted the 40-year-old teacher and sentenced him to three years imprisonment for sexually harassing minor students five years ago, in 2013. The teacher, though, secured a bail within three days of his conviction.

The principal said 39 students had given written complaints to her about the harassment they faced, three of whom deposed before the trial court.

The court allowed the convicted teacher's plea to be released on bail to file an appeal and told him to pay a fine of Rs 25,000 to the three survivors who had deposed.

The principal raised an alarm after the convicted teacher returned to teach and thereafter education department officials summoned representatives of the school management. ""On Monday, the management submitted a letter stating that they had terminated the teacher's services. They said they were waiting for the end of the 60-day grace period after conviction to allow an appeal to a higher court, as required under the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools Rules (MPSE), 1981. The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

This implies that the state has less than 10 per cent villages which have schools only up to middle or primary level.

The poorest performers at senior secondary level school education are Odisha, Nagaland and Jharkhand, with only 1.7 per cent, 1.8 per cent and 2.1 per cent villages, respectively, with such schools.

Ministry officials explain that the data is only for villages and not at the Gram Panchayat level -- which usually has a cluster of villages under it. The ministry hasn't yet collected Gram Panchayat-level data.

Effectively, this means that the 14 per cent villages that don't have schools might have one in a neighbouring village. This also implies that access to school education may not be as difficult.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)'s 2014 data said 94 per cent households in rural areas reported availability of primary school within 1 km from the house.

The NSSO data said it was the availability of higher levels of school that remained low in rural areas, a fact further corroborated by the current Rural Development Ministry data.

The government of India's flagship Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan aims at the universalisation of elementary education ""in a time bound manner"", as mandated by the Indian Constitution that calls for free and compulsory education to children in the 6-14 year age bracket.

They had gone to Dangs for a picnic. In another incident, a bus conductor died and 24 children of a school in Ahmedabad were injured when their bus rammed into a tree in Godhra in the wee hours of Tuesday.

Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel told reporters that the decision had been taken during the weekly meeting of the state cabinet, presided over by chief minister Vijay Rupani.

""Our government has decided to impose a ban on buses with school children from plying between 11pm and 6am to avoid accidents such as these in the future,"" Patel said.

The deputy CM said the decision had been taken bearing in mind the safety of children.

""The bus operators will be required to stop the journey during night time. They will also have to make lodging and boarding arrangements for children,"" he further added.

Chief secretary Dr JN Singh said, ""The issue was discussed with utter sincerity in the cabinet. The government has made it mandatory for school authorities to get sanction from concerned RTO office for educational tours. The RTO will assess the condition of the vehicle for transportation and number of students travelling on the bus viz-a-viz capacity of the vehicle.""

In case of both accidents, private luxury buses had been hired for picnics. In the first case, the bus was hired by a tuition class. Eight children and two others were killed in the accident in Dangs. In the second one, one person was killed and two dozen children were injured when the bus, returning from a picnic in Madhya Pradesh, met with an accident near Godhra.

The Ahmedabad RTO released a circular saying that all tour operators will have to abide by the new rules and that the number of children can't exceed the total capacity of the vehicle. The RTO also announced that strict measures would be taken against those tour operators who flout rules."

Besides imparting theoretical knowledge, the curriculum would also highlight the practical aspect of tackling obesity such as the necessity of physical activity, regular measurement of certain parameters and eating healthy food, the official said.

WITH 49 student suicides reported over the last five years from Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalayas across India, the Navodaya Vidyalaya Samiti (NVS) has proposed that the central government deploy two fulltime counsellors in each school, NVS Commissioner Bishwajit Kumar Singh tells Ritika Chopra. Excerpts:

Close to 50 suicides in five years. Is there something that the JNVs are doing wrong?

Student suicides in JNVs have to be understood in the context of the social background and psychological make-up of the children who study here. Entering the (Navodaya) system is a big change for them. There is a world of difference between rural life and life in a Navodaya Vidyalaya. I think we need a specialised set-up to help children acclimatise.

Although we have a system in place, it is not a specialised set-up. Our teachers are working hard on this front, but you have to acknowledge that one JNV teacher is responsible for 80 kids in a school. Raising even two children is a big challenge for parents these days. The teachers have largely succeeded (in helping students acclimatise), but there have been incidents of suicides.

Have you identified the main reasons behind the suicides?

Advertising

As I have mentioned already, the culture shock that a village boy or girl experiences after joining a JNV is a big reason. This is probably why suicides peak in July, August and September, which is right after the two-month summer break. The second peak period is exam season, January and February. Unrequited love and a hostile relationship between parents also drive students to an early grave. Lastly, corporal punishment or humiliation suffered at the hand of a teacher is also a reason why suicides have happened in the past.

Read: Suicides in Navodaya schools: 49 in 5 years, half of them Dalit and tribal students

What are you doing to stem these deaths?

Instead of leaving a chunk of teaching to the last few months before the exams, we have asked teachers to complete the syllabus by November, so that students have enough time to cope with stress. We are keen on engaging at least two counsellors in each school and we have recently submitted a proposal to this effect to the HRD Ministry.

We also noticed that a majority of suicides is by boys. This is probably because there are not any full-time wardens for the boys' hostels. The girls' hostel has had matrons since 1993. In the last one year, we have tried recruiting ex-servicemen as wardens, but there are not enough candidates. We have decided to not restrict the post to ex-servicemen.

Has the government agreed to the proposal on employing full-time counsellors in JNVs?

The proposal we sent involves an expenditure of Rs 56 to 60 crore every year. It is very expensive. So we are now looking at achieving the objective in an economical way. The fact remains that we do not require counsellors throughout the day. So now, there are two thoughts. First, why not have reputed institutions, which can be available on an on-call basis or which can counsel students online? Second, we could assign a counsellor to a cluster of five schools.

What do you do after a suicide to help other JNV students cope with the tragedy? Are they counselled?

Our school principals have certain amount of contingency fund, which can be used to hire a professional, but in general that does not happen. Usually, we depute teachers from other schools to ensure that they speak to the students so that they are not scared.

In many cases, JNV principals and teachers have been either suspended or transferred after a suicide for not being able to spot change in a child's behaviour or tell-tale signs of depression. They feel it's unfair to expect the overburdened employees to know what's going on in every child's mind. Your comment.

Advertising

When you head an institution you have to responsible and accountable. We have acted against principals and House Masters only in cases where we noticed they haven't discharged their duties properly. In 2017, a child in a JNV in Haryana committed suicide because a classmate didn't reciprocate his feelings. In such a case, the school authorities cannot claim they weren't aware of the change in the child's behaviour. The children are in our custody and the teachers should have known what the boy was going through. In a residential set-up, it is wrong for a teacher to think that their duty is only to teach. Also, should we not act in cases of corporal punishment? These incidents warranted action. We are not trying to harass teachers. Before any action there are two levels of inquiries."

Add to these the books for each subject. She also has to carry tiffin box and water bottle. Interestingly, she is only in Class II. Now can you imagine what we are doing to them,"" said the mother of two on condition of anonymity.

Another parent of a Class VI student was critical of the existing education system. According to him, more books and heavier bags do not make a student scholar.

""It is the way teachers teach in schools that makes a difference. But how many teachers are sincere? I see every student taking tuitions and why? Because what is taught in schools is not enough. And what about their health? My son already complains of backache,"" said the father who refused to give his name lest ""my ward is harassed and that is another issue, you cannot speak the truth"".

Robert Z Street, chairman of St John's Whitehall, sympathises with the children and their parents. ""The number of textbooks should be reduced and the children should instead take home story books. There is no benefit in giving excessive homework. Teaching and understanding should be in the classroom,"" he said.

Some parents feel there should be locker facilities. ""Heavy school bags are the problems for children... I strongly feel that schools should have some kind of arrangements to keep some of the workbooks in the class pigeonholes with locking facility,"" said a father.

Aaron Warjri, the principal of Shillong Government School, while welcoming the directive said children these days are ""overburdened by heavy schoolbags which may harm their bodies at a later age""."

The Government High School at Attavara in Hassan taluk gives a tough fight to private schools nearby by securing good results in SSLC, besides organising some unique activities to improve the learning ability of students.

""This time our target is 100% results will all first class,"" said K.P. Narayana, headmaster. Last year, we had 98% results and constant efforts by teachers helped improve the results this year. ""There is a notion among the public that rural students do not study hard. We want to prove that wrong.

Interestingly, teachers take out their personal time to visit their students late in the evening. Sometimes students are surprised to see their teachers on their doorstep. ""We go to their place and speak to their parents. The exercise helps us develop a contact with the parents and also see if students set aside enough time for studies at home,"" he said.

Recently, the school conducted a rangoli competition for students. It was unique because the students were told to draw the diagrams they study as part of their science syllabus. A student drew an image of the brain, nervous system, and respiratory system using colours provided by the teachers.

After school hours, students of classes 8, 9, and 10 have to take part in group studies. With the help of villagers, the school has got special benches on the campus for evening classes. All 98 students attend the classes, before leaving for home. H.L. Nagaraj, Assistant Commissioner of Hassan sub-division, has taken a special interest in improving basic amenities in the school. He visits the school regularly and motivates teachers and students for improving results.

The school has a rainwater harvesting system. Making use of the available water, students grow vegetables on the campus as part of their co-curricular activities. The vegetables grown are used for midday meals."

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

But when he got there, what he saw shocked him. The school was utterly dilapidated and Ramesh couldn't bear to see it in that condition.

Together with his father M Ramesh Babu and grandfather V Muthuraman, Krithik decided to start Empowering Rural India Foundation, a non-profit organisation, with the aim of uplifting government schools across the country.

But soon, Krithik realised that he did not have enough funds to take his vision forward. His folks suggested he look for sponsors.

Once he had the funds ready, Krithik approached the school management. Upon enquiring about the needs of the school, he was told that it faced occasional power outages, and the headmaster suggested that installation of solar panels would be of great help.

The family approached many solar service providers before finally zeroing in on a company, that two weeks ago, successfully managed to provide the school with the necessary infrastructure. With the installation of solar panels, the school can now easily save up to Rs 15,000 that otherwise was spent on electricity bills once in two months.

Interestingly, the solar panels can produce about 2kW of power, which is more than what the school needs. So, Krithik suggested that the school sell the excess power to the state electricity board.

On Saturday, Delhi Education Minister Manish Sisodia alleged that former Chief Secretary Anshu Prakash had decided to reduce this to 1,600 square metres, with support of DDA members.

On August 27, a High Court bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao had asked the DDA to complete all formalities with regard to the land in three months, and give possession to the Delhi government. It had asked that the government and various agencies cooperate for the development of a top-class Urdu medium school at the site of a vacated abattoir, which had earlier been earmarked for a parking lot.

On Saturday, Sisodia alleged that on September 12, Prakash convened a meeting without informing him, and that it was decided to reduce the size of the school to 1,600 square metres. ""They did so stating that 1,600 square metres is sufficient in accordance with CBSE's affiliation rules. They said children studying in classes XI and XII can be moved to other schools.

He further alleged that the matter was discussed in two DDA meetings -- one in September and one on Friday -- and that BJP members of the DDA supported ""commercial use"" of the land.

The Qaumi Senior Secondary School used to operate from a five-storey building in Sarai Khalil, demolished in 1976 during the Emergency. Since then, it has been operating out of rooms separated by tin sheets in a Shahi Dargah in Quresh Nagar, with classes beginning from the primary section and going up to Class XII. The management's struggle to rebuild the school received relief in September 2017 when the HC asked that the possibility of allotting land to the school be explored. Now, the fate of the project hangs in the balance again.

When contacted, Delhi Leader of Opposition and DDA member Vijender Gupta said, ""AAP gives everything a political colour. The area in question is extremely congested. It is completely commercialised and parking is a matter of highest priority... It is not possible to comment on this issue as the facts are not before us, but school, parking, everything can be worked out in the space.

Starting from December 22, students will appear for tests every Saturday with Gujarati being the first paper followed by Math, Environment, English, Hindi and so on.

The NAS survey, which was conducted in all the 33 districts of the state, interviewing over 1.25 lakh students, showed a consistent decline in the learning levels of students in mathematics, languages and science from Class III to Class VIII in the government school system -- both government schools and government-aided schools.

Cyberabad police commissioner V C Sajjanar said the police had arrested Methuku Ravinder, chief executive officer of Sun Pariwar Group of companies, and frozen Rs 14 crore deposited by his company in various banks.

Ravinder had been working as a government school teacher at Upper Primary School in Revalli village of Siddipet district. Unsatisfied with his meagre income, he applied for long leave from his job and floated his own company Sun Pariwar Group at Sangareddy in 2015.

""Since he was still a government employee, he started as many as eight different business outfits such as Sun Mutually Aided Thrift and Credit Cooperative Society Ltd, Methuku Chit Funds, Methuku Ventures etc. under the umbrella of Sun Pariwar Group, in the name of his close associates and relatives,"" the commissioner said.

Ravinder used to attract customers with a slogan of 'Kalisthe Gelustham (together we win)' and collected huge amounts to the extent of Rs 150 crore from gullible investors. His modus operandi was to collect Rs one lakh in the form of deposit in the company, for which the depositor would be returned Rs 6,000 per month as interest for a period of 25 months. In the 26th month, the depositor would be returned the principal amount of Rs 1 lakh.

""Ravinder also offered attractive incentives to the agents who would mobilise deposits -- a commission of 3% for a period of nine months if the deposit is Rs 5 lakh and 4% commission, if the deposit is more than Rs 5 lakh. Even if a member admits another member, he, too, would get a commission of 3%. He also used to take agents on holiday trips to Goa, Shimla, Bangkok and Dubai if they achieved their targets,"" Sajjannar said.

Thus, Ravinder collected huge amount of deposits running up to Rs 150 crore from gullible people who were attracted by high interest rates and commissions. Subsequently, he started avoiding payments of interests and principals to the depositors.

Following a complaint from a depositor, D Durgadas, the Shamirpet police of Cyberabad registered a case which was later transferred to the Economic Offences Wing. After a thorough investigation, the police cracked the case and arrested the accused.

""A cheating case was registered against Ravinder under section 420 of the IPC besides Section 5 of Andhra Pradesh Protection of Depositors of Financial Establishments Act, 1999. The other directors of the company are absconding,"" the police commissioner said."

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday inaugurated five tennis courts and a tennis academy at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya No. 2 in Punjabi Bagh as part of the Delhi government's policy that allows private academies to use the premises of schools run by the government.

These academies are given land for free and can use it commercially on two conditions -- half of all enrolments should be from Delhi government schools and that these students are not charged a fee.

Mr. Sisodia said the policy has received very enthusiastic response from organisations with expertise in sports training, and imparting art and cultural activities to children.

Stating that there should not be any difference in the quality of training, the Education Minister instructed the academy to ensure there is no segregation between students from surrounding areas and those from Delhi government schools.

He also asked the MLA and the school principal to explore the possibility of organising inter-school tournaments once the students are trained.

The Delhi government has also rolled out a 'Play and Progress' scheme to help talented sportspersons at the school-level hone their skills. Under the scheme, sportspersons under the age of 14 years are eligible to receive a quantum of assistance of ₹2 lakh per annum and ₹3 lakh for students in 14-17 years age bracket. The quantum of assistance can be enhanced by 20% in some cases.

Specialised training for these sportspersons is organised at 18 places, including Chhatrasal Stadium, Thyagaraj Sports Complex, East Vinod Nagar Sports Complex and Najafgarh Stadium.

Another scheme rolled out for established young sportspersons, called 'Mission Excellence', aims to see 100 top-level sportspersons of Delhi receive training and coaching sponsored by the government to prepare for international tournaments and championships.

Mr. Sisodia said that the problem with sports administration was that decision-making powers are held by those who have had no link with sports in their lives. ""The Delhi government has formed a special panel of experts with sportspersons to pick talented students, coaches and coaching techniques."""

However, reacting to the circular issued by the school on November 28, 2018, the directorate of education (DoE) has claimed that it has surplus funds of over Rs 2.5 crore. The DoE had ordered a rollback of the hike in fee, accusing the school of ""misuse of funds"".

The school says it was denied an opportunity to convey its stand and that it had increased the fee to meet the salary burden of the Seventh Pay Commission. It has moved court against the order.

In an order sent to the school in August 2018, the DoE said: ""The total funds available for the year 2017-18 amounts to Rs 20,16,52361 out of which cash outflow in the year 2017-18 is estimated to be Rs 17,61,95435. This results in surplus funds amounting to Rs 2,54,56,926. In view of the examination, it is evident that the school is having sufficient funds to meet the financial implications for financial year 2017-18 after meeting its expenditure.""

DoE audited the school's finances after some parents complained to the deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, who holds the education portfolio.

The DoE has also accused the school of misusing the development fund collected from the students.

The order raised red flags on the purchase of desks and chairs and on the transport fee collected from students.

""The school is collecting transport fee from the students but (it's) not shown in the financial statements of the school till 2015-16,"" said the order. The government has also questioned the amount spent by the school on computers. ""The expenditure on purchase of computers in 2016-17 was Rs 28.73 lakh, in 2017-18 it was Rs 50 lakh and the proposed expenditure for 2018-19 is Rs 10 lakh.

She is worried about her child's health. ""She is so fragile and often complains about her back. The problem can be fixed only by schools and teachers, we can only request them,"" she said.

The idea behind the government circular is to ensure good health and physical growth of growing children who are often seen complaining about back and shoulder pain.

JS Bhasin from the pediatric department at BLK Super Speciality Hospital said 68 per cent of the children in the age group of 7-13 face risks of a backache and hunchback because of heavy schoolbags. ""These problems may lead to early spondylitis and severe neck and back pain. It may also cause serious spinal damage and irreversible back problems. It also affects the mental growth of children as they feel tired all the time,"" he said.

He said heavy textbooks should be replaced with notepads. ""It's a one-time investment. Schools can provide files of various subjects,"" he said.

Avadesh Kumar Ojha, principal of Government Sarvodaya Coed Vidyalaya, Rohini Sector-8, said heavy bags are a result of traditional teaching patterns. ""Schools nowadays are focusing more on finishing the syllabus rather than enhancing students' learning abilities.""

""In my school, students don't carry water bottles weighing 1 kg as I have installed water purifiers. Similarly, if the school starts providing textbooks in classrooms, children will not have to carry such heavy bags,"" the Ojha said.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday asked the AAP government about the steps taken by it to ensure implementation of its circular on ensuring safety of children in all the schools in the national capital.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao directed the Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government to state in an affidavit the standard operating procedures laid down or instructions issued to implement the circular issued on August 11, 2018 and listed the matter for further hearing on January 24 next year.

The August 11 circular issued by DoE said that despite court orders and directions of DoE to the schools to carry out ""self inspection"" of the infrastructure and submit quarterly safety reports, there has only been ""half-hearted compliance"".

It also said that such ""half hearted approach"" would not work if the schools were serious about providing foolproof safety and security to the students.

The circular had suggested setting up of a school safety committee, holding monthly safety walks and submitting online safety reports to DoE and had warned of severe action, including withdrawal of recognition, against aided and recognised schools for repeated violation of the guidelines.

It had also warned of disciplinary action against the heads of the government-run schools for failure to follow the guidelines laid down in the circular.

The non-compliance of the circular was raised before the bench by advocate Ashok Aggarwal, who has been appointed as amicus curiae by the court to inspect schools in the national capital and ascertain how safe and secure they are for the children studying there.

Aggarwal was appointed as amicus in a PIL initiated by the court on its own after receiving a letter written by an advocate seeking improvement of the conditions in schools here.

Delhi resident Dishant Sharma had written a letter to the High Court seeking framing of guidelines to make schools accountable for children's safety.

He has also sought police verification of the support staff in the schools, counselling of all staff, installation of CCTV cameras on school premises, separate washrooms for students and no direct access of support staff in the premises.

In his report submitted before the court, Aggarwal has said that he visited six schools in the national capital and found that they were overcrowded, lacked proper infrastructure, were not completely disabled friendly, toilets were in bad shape and drinking water was not properly available.

Apart from that the two complaint boxes set up inside the schools to be checked by the police and the school, were never ever opened, he said in his report."

The Delhi High Court on Friday asked the Centre and the AAP government to sit together and work out a solution regarding the future of a 99-year-old school, which is in a dilapidated state, and the students studying there.

A bench of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao said the ""endeavour at first instance"" should be to provide a suitable alternative site to shift the Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, currently located in Delhi Cantonment, and the second option ought to be accommodating the students in other schools.

The direction by the court came after the Ministry of Defence said the land where the school is located cannot be handed over to the Delhi government for setting up a new institute.

""Handing over the land in question is out of the question,"" the ministry told the bench.

The Delhi government, on the other hand, said that while it can accommodate the students in other schools, it needs the school in question as its other educational institutions are ""overburdened"".

The court, thereafter, directed that deliberations be held at the highest level to work out a solution and a report be filed in three weeks.

""Endeavour at the first instance shall be to provide a suitable alternative site for the school,"" the court said and listed the matter for further hearing on January 8, 2019.

The bench was hearing a PIL by NGO Social Jurist which has alleged that Rajputana Rifles Heroes Memorial Senior Secondary School, taken over by the Delhi government in 1975 and getting 100 per cent aid from it, was in a horrible condition.

The Directorate of Education (DoE) of the Delhi government had earlier told the court that a joint inspection of the building had revealed that it was constructed in 1919 and has outlived its useful life and was unsuitable for habitation.

Advocate Ashok Agarwal, appearing for the NGO, had earlier said around 450 students are studying in the school and they have been unjustly deprived of adequate physical infrastructure and academic faculty.

The plea has said though the school is open for all, it mainly caters to the children of servants of military officials who are not in a position to educate their kids in private school.

It has alleged that the school lacks basic amenities, including potable drinking water, functional toilets, science and computer labs, clean classrooms and proper boundary wall and several posts of teaching staff are lying vacant.

The petition has sought direction that the existing building of the school be demolished and rebuilt as a state-of -the-art school."

As his father Yesudass is a truck driver, Sujit couldn't afford to take proper training in a dance academy.

Inspired by a senior who danced with dexterity during a school function when he was in elementary school, Sujith learned dance movements from watching movies.

Five years ago, when he was in Class VII, Sujith started to train himself by watching dance programmes in TV shows and YouTube.

Today, Sujith has won medals in more than 20 district-level competitions. He has also performed in programmes, including marriage functions.

Competing with more than 100 students from various schools, Sujith won the first prize in solo dance category competition at the 'Kala Utsav 2018' by performing folk dance.

Sujith has been selected for the state-level competition to be held in Chennai.

Of the eight students selected to participate in the state-level competitions under various categories, Sujith is the only student from government school.

""All I need is a platform to showcase my dancing skills and feedback from the viewers, so that I can improve myself. Dancing makes me happy. This is what matters to me and I am least bothered about winning or losing a competition,"" he said.

Apart from this, the School Education Department runs four primary schools while three special schools of National Child Labour Project (NCLP) were also run by an NGO, Service Unit for Development Activities in Rural (SUDAR) in the area.

After completing Standard 8 in the tribal school, students have to go to the Government Higher Secondary School at Bargur to continue their Standard 9. Since, the school is located about 29 km. from Kongadai, a few attend the school and stay in the hostels while most of them turn to be school drop outs.

With the demand for upgrading the school grew up, the State government had last year announced that the school would be upgraded. Hence, 50 students were admitted to Standard 9 in the current academic year. However, teachers are yet to be appointed.

S.C. Natraj, Director, Sudar, said that though the announcement for upgradation was made in September 2017, teachers were yet to be posted. Without teachers, the life of the students is affected who face many challenges in coming to the school, he added.

The woman has been working as a part time 'kuhar' since 1977 at a school in Sangrur district. 'Kuhar', according to Shanti Devi's counsel, is a person appointed to serve water and perform other menial tasks. ""In accordance with the state government policy, her services will now be regularised as a sweeper,"" her lawyer Charanpal Singh Bagri said.

The High Court also ordered regularisation of services of a 48-year-old woman, who has been working as a sweeper at another school since 1993. The two women had approached the High Court in 2014.

""After perusing the records and in view of the age of the petitioners, who are working in their respective schools from the last 21 to 35 years and still continuing in services, which are perennial in nature, the present petition is disposed of with a direction to the respondents to regularise the services,"" the order reads.

According to the case details, Shanti Devi has been working at Government Senior Secondary School, Khanori Kalan since October 1977. According to her Aadhaar card, her date of birth is January 01, 1934. Her counsels Charanpal Singh Bagri and Gurjit Kaur Bagri pleaded in the High Court that she has continued to work in the school due to extreme poverty and the school is in need of a full-time employee on the post.

""The petitioners are having good moral character and continuous attendance above 80 per cent since the time of their appointment,"" the counsel had submitted. The state government had contended that she has already attained the age of superannuation in December 1989 and until that year, her turn for regularisation of services had not come as per the seniority position defined in the policy.

However, Justice Jitendra Chauhan in the judgment said that Shanti had put in more than 12 years of service by the time she had reached the age of superannuation and as she is continuing her services, she cannot be denied her legitimate claim. ""Since the petitioners are working for the past 21 to 35 years in their respective schools, it is manifest that there is requirement of the posts.

Local residents said work on the subway, which commenced in 2014, was completed around two years ago. ""But the service road to connect the subway to the approach road has not so far been laid by the highways department.""

Pointing to the risk factor involved in crossing the railway track, CPI functionary V Vijayaraghavan, who is also a resident of Irugur, said the subway would help students reach the school safely.

The 60 days ended on Sunday,"" said Anil Sable, education inspector, Mumbai West.

MEPS Rules' Section 33 states that in case an employee is convicted in a lower court, the management can conduct an inquiry but not issue any order till the time the employee is entitled to appeal to a higher court against the conviction. ""Though the teacher said he had already moved Bombay high court against the lower court order, the management said they were unaware of the development and therefore gave him his termination letter on Monday,"" said Sable.

A copy of the letter has also been sent to the Maharashtra State Commission for Protection of Child Rights, the police and the suburban district collector's office -- all of whom were informed by the principal that the teacher had returned to the school. The principal, who has followed up on the case for years, said, ""The teacher's presence in the premises in spite of a conviction for such a grave case was dangerous.""

The school trustee did not respond to calls for a comment.

When TOI contacted the teacher, he said he had moved the high court on September 28. ""I will also approach the education department's tribunal for action against wrongful termination. I have already filed an appeal in high court,"" he said. The case will be heard on October 19."

Tithi Bhojan is a concept of providing nutritious food with community participation. It encourages families and religious/charitable institutions to donate food on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries, festivals and other

important days.

As per orders, the ministry wants local village residents and communities to contribute and organise a feast for kids to celebrate 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi. Following orders from MHRD, the state education department of Punjab too issued orders (dated October 12) to all schools to organise Tithi Bhoj for children on October 31. The school heads have to ensure that children are served some delicacies on October 31, not regular menu which they are served daily.

'Tithi Bhoj ' be organised with the community participation on 31/10/2018 and 2/10/2019,' say the orders.

Former HRD minister Smriti Irani had mooted the proposal to incorporate concept of Tithi Bhoj in mid-day meal in October 2014 and wanted other states to replicate Gujarat model, months after NDA government led by Narendra Modi came to power. Irani wanted all states in India to replicate Tithi Bhoj model of Gujarat where community participation is encouraged to serve food in schools. However, not many states had shown interest and it could not be implemented in all states.

Speaking to The Sunday Express, Prabhcharan Singh, general manager, Mid-Day Meal Society, Department of Education, Punjab, said that concept of Tithi Bhoj was similar to concept of 'langar' in Punjab. ""In both practices, community participation is encouraged. On special occasions, community members can contribute food for children's mid-day meal in local government schools. However, this is the first time that MHRD has issued orders to organise Tithi Bhoj on two particular days as part of Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary celebrations. It will be organised on October 31 this year and then October 2 (Gandhi Jayanti), 2019. We have ordered schools to implement it. They can either seek help of gurdwaras and local families to prepare feast for children or cook some delicacies in schools itself. Earlier too, when proposal was mooted in 2014 by former MHRD minister Smriti Irani, Punjab had no problem with it. In fact, we had even implemented it for few months and collected food materials from those who wanted to donate. But we do not collect any funds. Those who want to contribute can give food items only.""

He added that schools can organise Tithi Bhoj as per arrangements they have and there is no particular menu. ""They can prepare some desserts like kheer, halwa, other sweets or serve chana-poori, halwa-puri or something which is not served as part of regular menu. We have not given specific menu items so that teachers are not troubled but Tithi Bhoj has to be organised on October 31 and children should be served a feast in memory of Mahatma Gandhi,""

said Singh.

""I was apprised of the allegations by our officials. We decided to probe the accusations, and unfortunately they were found to be true. We have suspended the head of the school with immediate effect and initiated major penalty chargesheet against him,"" NDMC Commissioner Madhup Vyas told PTI.

The commissioner described the incident as ""bizarre"" and ""unpardonable"", saying it went against the grain of pluralistic society.

Mayor of North Delhi Adesh Gupta said the school in-charge was ""found to be guilty in preliminary investigation"".

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights also issued a notice to the head of school run by the NDMC, asking them the reason for shuffling students on the basis of their religion.

The commission said such a segregation could have an adverse effect on holistic learning and development of students and also negatively impact the social fabric of the country.

""The matter is very serious. It may damage the social fabric of the country. This is a plot against the Constitution. I have asked the director of Education Department to enquire into the matter and submit the report by Friday,"" Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said.

The primary school falls in Wazirabad area of north Delhi and administered by the NDMC. The area comes under the Civil Lines Zone of the civic body.

All municipal corporation-run schools in Delhi are primary schools. Teachers in other municipal schools expressed their shock over the reports.

""Schools, primary level no less, should be kept away from politics, and religion and caste matters should not be mentioned, for a balanced growth of a child. When a student enters a school, he or she is not a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh or Christian, but an Indian and that is how we should educate them,"" a teacher in a civic school in Karol Bagh said, on condition of anonymity.

""If the segregation is being done there, then it is condemnable, and we strongly disapprove of it. Schools should unite and not divide people, and these children are such impressionable minds, it will not bode well for their growth,"" he said."
