The aim is to detect unregistered schools as well as those not adhering to safety norms, officials said.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

""We have 685 government schools in Gautam Budh Nagar. However, these are not enough to meet the needs of a huge migrant population. At the same time, we cannot allow safety to be compromised,"" he added."

To tackle the taboo around menstruating, teachers have been advised similarly by Brighton Council to teach young children. However, the new rules have received harsh criticism for trying to confuse young children.

The teacher guidance, from Brighton & Hove City Council, states: 'Trans boys and men and non-binary people may have periods' and 'menstruation must be inclusive of all genders'. It says that ""bins for used period products are provided in all toilets"" for children. Also, trans pupils and students should be provided with additional support from a school nurse if required.

The emergence comes after it was reported that a state secondary in Brighton has 40 pupils who 'do not identify as gender presented at birth'. Daily Mail quoted Tory MP David Davies as saying that explaining the concept of transgender boys having periods to eight-year-olds would be 'insanity' for teachers. He said, ""Learning about periods is already a difficult subject for children that age, so to throw in the idea girls who believe they are boys also have periods will leave them completely confused.""

Stephanie Davies-Arai, from the campaign group Transgender Trend, said, ""Girls going through puberty are already having a difficult time. What they should be given is clear language to be able to talk about their bodies and their female biological functions without couching it in politically correct terms."" Campaigner Julie Bindel said, ""To tell impressionable children that boys can also menstruate sidelines girls who should be getting support when they start their periods.""

The report quoted Brighton & Hove City Council as saying, ""By encouraging effective education on menstruation and puberty, we hope to reduce stigma and ensure no child or young person feels shame in asking for period products inside or outside of school if they need them. We believe that it's important for all genders to be able to learn and talk about menstruation together... Our approach recognises the fact that some people who have periods are trans or non-binary."""

Also, the education department is planning to extend the Government Model Primary School (GMPS) in Sector 49 to middle level (till class VIII). This was stated by the officials from the education department in its preliminary plan as final decision will be taken only after conducting a proper survey of these schools and the nearby schools after the re-transfer process is done.

The eight primary schools being re-transferred are- GPS -12, GPS - Bapudham Colony, GPS- Buterla, GPS- Mauli Complex, GPS- Railway Colony, GPS- Manimajra - I, GPS- Manimajra - II, and GMPS - 49 (the newest among all schools).

""There are the schools which do not have good infrastructure and have less number of students, so we will be adjusting students in nearby schools. Also, the schools which are large in spaces will be further upgraded,"" said an official from the UT education department requesting anonymity.

The shifting, as per teachers may prove to be an unsuccessful task as the schools, especially in Mauli complex, railway colony and Manimajra are already overcrowded.

The schools that will get prior attention from the education department include Government Primary School in Maulijagran, Government Primary School in railway colony and Manimajra-II as these are running in worst conditions of all. GPS in Mauli and railway colony are not even having their own buildings and are being run in rented buildings.

In a reality check, the TOI had reported how these three schools had poor infrastructure as they are so small that they cannot even afford to have furniture in classrooms and accommodate students.

The department is also planning to close Government Primary School in Buterla, Sector 41 due to low enrollment of students. ""The building can be put to some other good use. There is no point in running a separate school for a few students,"" the official added.

The school has 130 students at present studying in nursery class and classes I-V.

These schools further lack basic facilities like playgrounds and teachers have to be on toes to ensure students don't get injured as few swings that lie in the corner of small yards. Thus, making it unsafe for students. In some schools situated in Mauli complex and railway colony, they utilize the adjoining neighbourhood park as they don't have their own playgrounds. This, however, raises security concerns for children, as the park is also used by people and vendors.

GMPS will further be upgraded to middle level. Moreover, the school's building needs attention too. The other seven government primary schools have been running under the MC Chandigarh since 2010."

""The idea is to inform parents and community members about various government welfare schemes, so that they could benefit from them and improve their living standards,"" said an official. Parents would also be able to inquire about their child's progress at these centres, he said.

The initiative stems from a successful experiment undertaken at a government primary school in Gonda district.

To connect better with community members, the primary school in Dhaurahra area of Gonda set up a parents' corner/ counter on its premises. ""The response was overwhelming. Parents and community people immediately connected with the school, inquiring about different welfare schemes,"" said principal Ravi Pratap Singh.

Now, a state government order, dated December 6, has directed officials to implement the initiative in all government primary schools in UP.

Director basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, said on Monday, ""It was an innovative idea of a visionary teacher in a Gonda school -- a wonderful move to connect with the community! It also helped increase the participation of community members in the school's activities. We now want to replicate the initiative in other schools, so that more people can benefit from it.""

""The parents' corner will disseminate information on emergency services such as Dial 100, 1090 (for women in distress), fire and ambulance services, as well as road safety and traffic rules,"" he said.

The initiative will also look at improving women's literacy in every district, as envisaged in the Centre's 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' (BBBP) campaign. ""It will educate masses about free and compulsory education for all children under the Right to Education (RTE) Act. For people who are uncomfortable in filling up bank cash deposit forms, the schools will keep deposit forms of different banks and help community people in filling them up,"" said director basic education.

He said the counter would also educate community members about the health department's new welfare schemes such as Ayushman Bharat and other programmes, including free cataract operations, vaccinations, and facilities available for pregnant women.

Explaining how the school managed to make a strong impact with its parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh said, ""We informed the locals about the government's Ujjwala scheme and many of them benefited from it. We followed it up with information on the CM's helpline for Swachh Bharat Mission, which enabled people to register their complaints. Likewise, we kept passing useful information to them from time to time.""

Gram pradhan Rajani added, ""As agriculture is the only occupation of villagers, the school's teachers took out time to educate farmers about the latest technologies that would improve their yield and lower costs. Teachers also educated villagers about the ill-effects of liquor and tobacco consumption on their health. How to preserve the environment for a better tomorrow was another subject on which the teachers created awareness.""

Apart from pioneering the idea of the parents' corner, Ravi Pratap Singh also introduced digital methods of imparting lessons at his school. He said that when he joined the school in August 2013, only 138 students were enrolled there. ""The biggest challenge was to make education interesting for them. I started using my mobile phone and tablet to teach them rhymes, and realised that their interest levels went up substantially,"" he said."

There is no better symbol for this diversity than the ancient banyan tree with its huge structure, deep roots and many branches which give shelter to so many different living beings.

Choosing the languages that are to be used in primary education is therefore no easy matter, and decisions will necessarily depend on local and regional infrastructures which vary enormously. While many teachers intuitively know that it is important to use the languages children speak at home also as the medium of instruction in school, there is considerable parental pressure to use more English in schools. Managing and reconciling different demands is no easy matter for policy makers and evidence is needed to ensure these decisions are well-informed. For this reason, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli from Cambridge University, and co-investigators from Reading University and academic institutions in India have started a new research project which focuses on multilingualism in primary schools in India. The project - in partnership with British Council - aims to provide policy makers, teachers, parents and (last but not least) the children themselves with new evidence which can help them to make better choices about schooling.

The MultiLila project aims to find out whether children who learn through the medium of a language which is different from their home languages have differing levels of learning outcomes than children whose home and school language is the same: do they learn more, or less, faster or slower? It also explores whether or not there are differences in the learning attainment of children attending schools in more deprived areas and between boys' and girls' learning of reading and maths. On a recent visit to Delhi, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli from the University of Cambridge, Principal Investigator of the project, discussed these issues with the Minister of Education in Delhi, Mr Manish Sisodia, who is keen to ensure educational policies are based on scientific evidence. Ms Atishi Marlena, advisor on education to the AAP-led Delhi government, concurred saying: 'With this project, we are also going to be the recipients of their research. British Council India and Cambridge University will provide us with a lot of insights on this.'

As all teachers know, it can be challenging to explain new concepts to learners. Concepts such as evaporation or condensation are not easy to understand for primary school children, who may struggle to grasp what these chemical processes involve. This is particularly true for children who learn through the medium of a second language, which is the case in schools where English is the medium of instruction. Most children do not speak English at home, but a variety of other languages, and they are still in the process of learning English. They may be able to use some everyday words and grammatical constructions, such as 'What's your name?' or 'I like reading' but this is not a sufficient basis for understanding abstract, academic or technical words such as condensation. An added problem is that translation equivalents may not be available or known in the local or regional languages.

Thus, one colleague present at one of the schools visited by the research team did not know the translation equivalent of 'condensation' in Hindi, despite being highly fluent in the language. Presenting children with translation equivalents in Hindi is not helpful if the concept itself is poorly understood. Despite these difficulties, some teachers excelled at explaining such ideas by making reference to the children's home environment: they asked the children to think about what happens to boiling water when their dinner is prepared at home. The children know that during cooking, water turns into steam which rises up into the air (evaporation) and it may subsequently condensate against the window. This can be seen on the window in the form of droplets (condensation). According to Professor Theo Marinis such explanations are best understood when the teacher uses the children's home languages: 'Developing children's understanding of science concepts and analytical skills in discussing these builds on language, as does learning in other school subjects.'

This is also true for so-called word problems in maths. These are short stories which contain an arithmetic problem that needs to be extracted by the child, as in: 'Ritu walks around the playground. The playground is a square, which means it has the same length on all the four sides. The playground is 20 meters along. Ritu walks all around the edges of the playground. How many meters does she walk in total?' Tackling such problems is only possible for a child who has a good understanding of the language used in the task, and this can be very challenging for children who learn through the medium of English. Many children will need to make use of their home languages in order to fully grasp what they need to do.

A key issue for all teachers and policy makers is therefore understanding what threshold level is needed for children to be able to take part in English-medium instruction: what is the minimum amount of English needed? This could be specified in terms of the number of words that need to be known but knowledge of grammar is equally essential. From the available literature we know that it can take between five and ten years until children are ready to handle the complexities of school subjects through the medium of a second language, but further evidence is needed to establish what thresholds are applicable in a variety of Indian contexts.

The MultiLila project takes place in three cities: Delhi (Professor Minati Panda), Hyderabad (Professor Suvarna Alladi and Dr Lina Mukhopadhyay) and Patna (Dr Lina Mukhopadhyay) and is funded by the UK's Economic Social and Research Council and by The Department for International Development. 'Key partners in the project are researchers from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), English and Foreign Languages University (Hyderabad) and the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences, Karnataka, as well as the British Council,' says Professor Tsimpli, 'as they know the Indian context.'

Currently, data collection is underway, with around 1,000 child participants (Standard IV) in the database. The same children will re-take the same language, cognitive and maths assessments in a year's time to establish development of skills over time under different conditions. Final research findings are to be expected to be reported in 2020."

In a district of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, 197 upper primary schools will adopt Chhota Internet to increase learning opportunities for their students.

Using this, the schools will be able to access better quality educational material over a WiFi network without using the internet. This digital initiative will also allow schools to focus on each student's progress and help them design custom-based programmes to further enhance a student's performance. Digital literacy, when harnessed in a controlled and responsible environment, can help schools find, evaluate, utilise, share and create content using information technologies and the internet.

Chhota Internet is aimed at bridging the gap between quality education and its beneficiaries, with students as the focus of buffer-free education content.

The initiative will uplift the traditional educational system in the rural area and address various issues that hinder the quality of education like lack of internet penetration, shortage of quality teachers and measurements of the growth of children.

In a press statement, Sandeep Arya, CEO and Chairman of Chhota Internet, said,

""The digital age has opened up newer dimensions to learning, which were previously unheard of. The 21st-century learning is more complex than ever before, and the current context of growth demands various skills from a student. Therefore, it is the need of the hour for us to use digital technology like Chhota Internet to provide more efficient ways of learning. As rural India prepares for a tectonic change in education with the launch of digital classrooms, we need to ensure consistent implementation of digital literacy on a large-scale to ensure quality education.""

His vision of Chhota Internet is to bridge the gap between learning and growth and erase the educational divide. Sandeep said, ""More of this can happen when corporations direct their CSR funds to this cause instead of solely depending upon government funding. Chhota Internet will achieve this by bringing students in rural India abreast with the rest of the world, in terms of providing access to a more advanced system of education that is loaded with the latest technological aids, paving the way for future growth via innovative technology."""

The General Education Department has also decided to provide space for anganwadis in government schools where excess accommodation was available and pre-primary school was not functioning.

SCERT Director J Prasad told Express that the new curriculum will focus on activity cards rather than using textbooks.

""In an effort to make the pre-primary education system scientific, we are introducing a new curriculum. As part of this, we have already started activity cards named 'Kalithoni'. The cards have 30 different themes and the first part is the collection of 10 themes.

""The cards aim at children's physical, creative, language, scientific and social and emotional development. Besides children, the new programme will also benefit the pre-primary school teachers"", Prasad said.

He, however, is apprehensive about the fund for implementing the project. ""We had long back submitted a project report to the union government for the funds. However, the funds are yet to be released. If the Centre doesn't sanction the funds, the state government has decided to move on with the state funds,"" said Prasad. General Education Secretary A Shahjahan said the SCERT and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyaan are on the job to implement the programme.

""Apart from benefiting the children, it could also help to give a good pay to the teachers. The engaging of pre-primary staff by the PTAs could not be termed as statutory appointments by the government.

""Therefore, their claim for salary was not sustainable. Similarly, employees in the government sector, such as anganwadi workers, helpers and alternative school teachers, were paid only honorarium. So a hike in honorarium will be considered along with the project,"" Shahjahan said."

""Children's library is a great place to read and learn, understand and explain,"" Sisodia asserted as he went on to inaugurate a similar library in School of Excellence, Khichripur.

The initiative is in continuation of the project that successfully transformed 45,000 classrooms from classes VIII to XII into hi-tech classrooms. The hi-tech lab project, which was announced in this year's state budget, would be funded by Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB). As per the DPR which KITE has submitted to the government, the entire process would be completed within six months.

Once the hi-tech lab project is completed, Kerala would become India's first 'digital state in education' before June 1 next year. The project covers 9,941 government and aided UP as well as LP schools in the state. As part of the project, each primary school would get between two to 20 laptops along with USB speakers, up to 10 multi-media projectors, multi-function printers and 42 inch LED TV. All schools included in the project would be equipped with high-speed broadband internet connectivity.

According to KITE vice chairman and executive director K Anvar Sadath, schools with an average student strength of seven or more in a division have been considered for the project. Exemptions have been given to special schools and tribal schools

The project also includes IT infrastructure upgradation, digital content, capacity building for teachers and students and e-governance. Unlike in high school and higher secondary section where all the classrooms were made hi-tech, ICT equipment is deployed in a movable stage in labs so that they can be taken to classrooms as and when required.

Currently dedicated ICT textbooks- Kalipetti for lower primary and e@Vidhya for upper primary are made available for all primary level students. ""We would complete the development of digital resources for primary schools in Samagra resource portal, impart ICT training for all teachers and empower primary school IT co-ordinators before setting up the hi-tech labs,"" Anvar Sadath added.

Equipment procured for the project would carry a five-year comprehensive warranty and insurance protection. A web-portal for complaint registration along with a call-centre facility would ensure timely complaint management."

On September 29, The Ministry of Education (MOE) said that the change will let students focus more on his or her learning progress. It will thus discourage them from comparisons and being overly concerned about their performances.

Here are the details that will be dropped from report cards:

The education ministry in a statement said, ""The change is to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned about comparisons.""

Abiding by the new rules, all examinations for Primary 1 and 2 pupils will also be removed. Reportedly, MOE said that the teachers will encourage learning through discussion, homework and quizzes. Teachers will use ""qualitative descriptors"" instead of marks and grades to evaluate students' performance.

Addressing around 1,700 school leaders, Ong said, ""I know that 'coming in first or second', in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student's achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from young that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline they need to master for life.""

He further said, ""Notwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses."" For older students in primary and secondary schools, marks will be rounded off and given as a whole number. During parent-teacher meetings, parents will receive information about the child's progress in school."

In a letter, Uttar Pradesh's Basic Shiksha Parishad secretary, Ruby Singh, asked all education officers to ensure schools remain open on Monday and hold programmes to educate children about the teachings of Vishwakarma.

According to The Times of India, last year, schools in the state remained open on 17 September, due to a pulse polio campaign, despite it being a Sunday. The Yogi Adityanath-led government increased the number of restricted holidays from 16 to 30 this year with Vishwakarma Puja as one of them.

""The Vishwakarma Puja was always an off day for schools until this year. Celebrations will take place for the first time,"" the report quoted an official as saying.

It is believed that Lord Vishwakarma built palaces, weapons and buildings for the gods. He is known as the 'God of Vastu Shastra', the 'First Engineer', the 'Engineer of the Gods' and the 'God of Machines'. On this day, workers such as architects, carpenters, engineers, artists, mechanics and factory workers take a break from their jobs and clean up the machines, tools, equipment etc. in their offices and factories, as per News18.

The festival is primarily celebrated in Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Bihar, Tripura, and Odisha.

In the case of Urdu medium schools, the ability to read a story in Urdu improved from 17% to 57%.

Elated with the success, the state government by the end of 2019 will extend this partnership with Pratham in 21 districts of the state.

Divulging details of the training method of Pratham which has brought about significant changes, founder of Pratham Mysore, Ashvini Ranjan told TOI, ""The uniqueness in our training lies in segregating the children based on their learning levels. In a typical classroom, there are children who have stopped learning at different levels. While 10% of a classroom is made up of frontbenchers who have little or no difficulty, the remaining 90% have difficulties in learning at various levels.""

""By segregating them, the teachers who are trained by our master trainers will provide individual attention to every child to help them catch up by clearing their doubts and the children rapidly catch up,"" said Ranjan.

""To promote a healthy and friendly classroom atmosphere, we ask the teachers to squat on the floor along with the children as it makes a world of a difference to the children as they feel less intimidated by the teacher,"" said Ranjan asserting that a significant change was witnessed after this method was adopted. The children do not get frightened and a friendly atmosphere is created and learning becomes fun, he added.

""We also update the parents about their wards' progress which is making them wake up and pay attention to their children,"" Ranjan said.

Elated by the difference made to the children, Ranjan said, ""We are participating with the government at every step in this short-term intervention. Many a times, there are teachers who are not so welcoming of our master trainers who are young men and women between the ages of 20-25, but the difference made in the learning process of these children is reassuring and encourages us to do better.""

Explaining the Teaching at Right Level (TARL) methodology of Pratham, Jagadish, a programme coordinator for Pratham, said, ""Our methodology focuses on teaching students based on their levels by giving them individual attention. Some children will not be able to identify letters, some won't be able to read words and some others won't be able to read sentences. We identify such problems and help them overcome those problems. There are many dedicated teachers who put in a lot of effort to help these children overcome their learning difficulties.""

After grouping the children by classifying them as 'letter level', 'word level', and 'sentence level', a semicircle is formed and the teacher sits down on the floor to impart lessons which boosts one-to-one relationship, added Jagadish.

Pointing to the pivotal role played by Teaching Learning Materials (TLM) of Pratham, Rachaiah, a member of the State Resource Group (SRG) who teaches mathematics, said, ""We adopt the touch and learn method which makes learning not only easy, but also fun. To teach mathematics, we use straws, coins, and currency notes when we have to teach them simple addition, subtraction, division or multiplication.""

Crediting the method adopted by Pratham for improving soft skills of the children, he said, ""Along with learning, the speaking skills of the children also saw a huge improvement."""

Mr. Dattatreyagoud was delivering the presidential address at the sixth two-day Gadinad Kannada Sahitya Sammelan at Holagundi in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh, adjoining Ballari district, on Monday. ""I appeal to all Kannada protagonists, littérateurs, activists, organisations, among others to oppose the government's move and prevail upon it to review its decision,"" he urged.

He was also of the view that lack of exchange of views by coordination committees had caused a problem. ""Kannada, needs all support and encouragement, without which organising sammelans and meetings would be a waste.

He also underlined the need for the State government to provide hostel facilities for students in border areas irrespective of their caste, creed and income. The Kannada Book Authority, which has been providing books to school libraries should do so for Kannada medium schools in border areas too.

As many as five private aided Kannada medium schools and two government primary schools have been closed for lack of students in Udupi district for the present academic year.

The five aided schools are Ganapathi Aided Higher Primary School, Nalkuru, Little Flower Higher Primary School, Belman, Aided Secondary School, Mattukopla, Nityasahayamatha Aided Higher Primary School, Yellur, and UBMC Aided Higher Primary School, Santhur.

The two government primary schools that have been closed down are Government Lower Primary School, Kadthala, and Government Lower Primary School, Siddapur.

According to K. Seshashayana, Deputy Director of Public Instruction (DDPI), there were teachers in accordance with the number of students in aided schools. If teachers retired, there was no provision for appointment of new teachers in aided schools.

These schools did not get maintenance grants. This made running them tough, he said.

The two government lower primary schools are being closed because of migration of younger brothers and sisters studying in these schools with their elder brother and sisters to higher primary schools.

Yet another reason for the closure of these schools is parents' inclination towards English-medium schools. Besides, the school buses of English-medium schools are now picking children even from villages.

But the problem is that once the number of students declined in the schools, the number of teachers appointed there also went down.

There are 27 government lower primary Kannada-medium schools in the district which have a strength of less than 10 students in the present academic year.

These schools having less than 10 students have one teacher and another guest teacher.

Yet another reason for schools closing down or having less than 10 students is the decline in population growth in the district.

But bucking the trend, there are schools, where the number of students increased in Class One such as in government schools in Thekkatte, Basrur and Koteshwar. ""As many as 101 students have been admitted to Class One in Thekkatte,"" Mr. Seshashayana said.

Again the seven primary schools, which have been closed for the present academic year, could be opened in the next two years, if there are five students desiring to join the schools there.

If there are no students for three years in a row, then they are closed down. Then, the documents of such schools are shifted to the neighbouring higher primary schools."

Official sources said SMC has partnered with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Torrent Power for rainwater harvesting, LEDs and five-star rated fans for solar power plants. The primary schools are located in areas like Katargam, Ved Road, Athwalines, Karanj and Althan.

The entire project is based on the public-private-partnership (PPP) model. While ONGC will bear the total cost of Rs 20 lakh for rainwater harvesting, the cost of Rs 26 lakh for solar power plants will be borne by municipal corporation and the central government.

One of the most pressing challenges faced by the Indian education system is to bridge the gap between the infrastructure and quality of education in a private school and that of a government school. While the government rethinks its model for public schools across the country, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and citizen groups have taken it upon themselves to bring about change.

The Avasar Foundation, a Bengaluru-based NGO recently inaugurated a pre-primary school at the Seegehalli Government Higher Primary School located in Kadugodi, near Whitefield in Bengaluru. This pre-primary school has been built on the kindergarten model that is seen in private schools today. The free-of-cost school will cater to the needs of children aged between 3 and 6 years from underprivileged families.

Pre-primary education costs of one child in India can exceed a minimum of Rs. 45,000 per year in a private school. Combine the lack of government incentives and infrastructure with the acute financial barrier that families below the poverty line face, and you get a public education system which has to combat a serious setback.

The Avasar Foundation plans to explore possible solutions. The problem isn't only financial. Underprivileged families have not yet witnessed or know about the importance of pre-primary education. While government schools are still struggling to set the facility up, admission to private pre-primary schools only continues to become more competitive.

Where many children embark on their journey of learning at the age of three in private schools, the kids who miss out on this have to spend time trying to catch up with other kids who had the opportunity. There are government preschools like Anganwadi's. The Government of Karnataka has launched pre-primary (LKG and UKG) classes in government schools. But as of now, the gap still remains apparent.

This is where the Avasar Foundation is trying to help. ""The Avasar Pre-primary School bridges an important gap we notice in early childhood education, especially for the underprivileged families who cannot afford to send their wards to expensive private play schools. This is a pilot project and more such playschools will come up in neighbouring government schools from the next academic year based on the corporate sponsorship we are able to mobilise,"" says Anand Chaturvedi, Managing Trustee, and Founder of The Avasar Foundation.

The first school by the Avasar Foundation was unveiled on 6th July 2018 at the Government Higher Primary School, Seegehalli the parents and children in the presence of the BEO for K.R. Puram, Saleem Pasha, and chief guest Kamlesh Jha, Director, Terex India. The event marked the official hand-over of the school to the government authorities.

The preschool is part of the CSR project led by Expeditors- a Fortune 500, global logistics company. Avasar Foundation has not only invested in the infrastructure but has also provided the staff to maintain the school. The pre-primary school curriculum is structured along the lines of the private kindergarten model. The school has been completely redone. The rooms which now constitute the school were once dark, with paint chipping off walls and had a seepage issue. In their earlier condition, the rooms would not qualify to be a preschool on any account. Now the rooms are well-lit, colourful and exactly how one would envision a preschool to be. ""Avasar Foundation has changed the look of the school, if you look at it now you wouldn't think this is a government school!"" said Saleem Pasha (BEO) about the new pre-primary school.

Building a preschool requires those who engage in the project to consider many factors before drawing up plans. Preschools cater to the needs of children who are very young, therefore safety and security are of the utmost importance. Children need supervision and sensitive caretakers, therefore the selection of staff has to be done keeping this in mind.

Refurbished at a cost of about Rs. 8 Lakhs, the state-of-the-art preschool will be managed by The Avasar Foundation - the implementation agency for Expeditors. The school is equipped to handle 40 students currently. Two teachers and a caretaker have been appointed to manage the school. Admissions and education at the preschool will be completely free of cost and will be allotted purely on a first-come-first-served basis. In addition to providing infrastructure to schools, it also provides faculty to ensure that the infrastructure is put to good use.

The preschool has begun functioning in the academic year 2018-19 and the age group of the students enrolled is between three to six years. The preschool has incorporated all safety measures and young children's needs, including CCTV surveillance, and disabled-friendly restrooms. There are two refurbished classrooms, one for the Lower Kindergarten students and the other for the Upper Kindergarten students.

The preschool education of each child enrolled will be completed upon turning six. Through continuous evaluation and activities, the child will be assessed on his/her knowledge and ability to apply the same. The medium of instruction at the school will be the child's mother tongue. A budget of Rs. 12-15 Lakhs for 2018-19 has been secured and the project is managed by Malavika Chaturvedi, Program Manager at The Avasar Foundation.

""It's heart-warming to see organisations and individuals working for the betterment of government schools. Towns have temples, temples only flourish when all the people of the town join hands to ensure the upkeep of the temple. Otherwise, the temple will fall into disrepair. It's the same with the (government) schools. I hope they continue to care about our schools like this,"" said BEO, Saleem Pasha, at the inaugural function.

The Avasar Foundation is a small NGO that has worked over the past six years on the gaps in the Indian government education system. Founded by Anand Chaturvedi and Sriram SN in 2012 as a CSR initiative of Expeditors, the organisation believes that, ""Ability is nothing without opportunity."" The organisation is currently based in five major cities across India, and believes in bringing opportunities to those who have abilities but face financial and cultural barriers.

Avasar's scholarship program currently funds the education of 45 girls over the age of 15. The scholarship is provided on the basis of merit and need. It covers the entire cost of education right from PUC until they complete their undergraduate degrees. The NGO also provides skill training to the girls to ensure that they are not only educated but are also employed. Avasar Foundation's Digital Literacy Program has provided state-of-the-art computer labs to government schools across India along with teachers to teach the subject in schools.

Government education faces many hurdles on a day-to-day basis such as a lack of funding and inadequate infrastructure. It's not enough to have classrooms and buildings, there need to be students in those classrooms and teachers to teach them. The Avasar pre-primary school then comes at a crucial time and doubles up as an optimistic sign of things to come. The real test for the school will be the response and the feedback it gets, and the ability to emulate the model elsewhere."

Punjab Education Secretary Krishan Kumar said these pre-primary classes ""will help the government schools in a big way in the future and strengthen the foundation of the education system in these schools"".

The academic year 2017-18 had opened with 781 government primary schools, the number was down to 757 at the end of 11 months, for want of students. There appear to be no takers for government primary schools even though the enrolment across all schools in Goa for Class I increased by around 300 students as against the previous academic session 2016-17.

Meghana Shetgaonkar, deputy director of education, said that several low enrolment government primary schools have been saved from being shut down by amalgamating the students and teachers at the schools with neighbourhood ones. ""This year, we have a proposal from three government primary schools, which had earlier shut due to low enrolment, to be reopened as they see sufficient students now in the neighbourhood to enrol in them.""

Data points to an ongoing migration of students to aided institutes. Educationists have maintained that it is a problem of perception that privately-managed institutes offer better quality of education and infrastructure.

But, the state government, too, as a policy provides facilities like the Balrath buses to aided institutes, which are not on offer to government primary schools.

Now the number of government primary schools to have shut down since 2013-14 has gone up to 137. One the other hand, the number of government-aided schools has remained constant at 400 over the last few years.

In a bid to improve the conditions of government schools, the state has spent over Rs 58 crore already for repair and upgradation of their buildings, along with carrying out plumbing and electrical works. But, according to state documents, government schools are given priority for repair, maintenance and upgradation work, based on the student strength, urgency of repairs required, and condition of schools provided by the directorate of education.

The criteria of student strength to give priority for repairs further puts low enrolment schools at a disadvantage.

Another 300-odd government primary schools could be heading towards closure with fewer than 20 students enrolled in them from Class I to IV.

However, in talukas that are largely rural, government primary schools actually saw their enrolment go up in 2017-18.

Canacona and Quepem were also among the few regions where no new government primary schools had to close during 2017-18.

Even the ayahs at these schools are a deprived lot.

According to All Kerala Pre-primary Teachers and Helpers Organisation secretary Vijaya Shoma, the government is yet to recognise the pre-primary sections in aided schools as part of the institutions. ""Because of this, no pay scale exists for pre-primary teachers in aided schools. This is a huge injustice,"" she said.

Shoma said when the division fall began to affect schools, both government and aided, the authorities decided to begin pre-primary sections. ""The government even gave funds to carry out mid-day meal schemes at these schools,"" she said.

Hence, it becomes very evident that the government is well aware of the existence of these pre-primary sections, she said.

""The pre-primary sections that came into being before 2012 have been recognised by the government and they are provided with funds for the mid-day meal scheme.

According to Shoma, these pre-primary teachers who have qualifications at par with those who have been appointed through PSC are worthy of and eligible to draw the salary stipulated by the government.

""But alas, nobody hears our plea. We had time and again petitioned the government. We even went before the commission that was formed to study the problems faced by the pre-primary section. But all have come to nought,"" she said.

According to the teachers, when they filed an RTI query seeking the report filed by the commission, they were told it is not ready. ""The entire thing is confusing. The commission was to file the report in June last year. But they filed it only in February this year. When we tried to gain access to the report via RTI, we were told it was yet to be filed. So, we approached the Education Minister, who said the report has been filed but can't be published since the government has to study it in detail,"" she said.

We don't know anything about the book nor have been given any training. The entire thing is a big jolt for us. Hence, we want the government to organise a training camp for us too. We don't want to be kept in the dark,"" she said.

The secretary of school education, Punjab, has issued an order, asking the government primary schools to ""decide at their own level"" if they will be able to implement English as the medium of instruction from this session. According to the order, which reached the district education officers on Thursday, 1,886 middle (Class VI to VIII), high (Class VI to X) and senior secondary (Class VI to XII) schools are going for English as their medium of instruction from this session. It is, however, optional and not compulsory for students who want to continue in Punjabi .

""As regards primary schools, a suggestion has been received from teachers that they should be given liberty to start English medium as per their choice and availability of resources. Accordingly, it has been decided that primary school teachers may decide at their own level to start English medium in their schools,"" read the order.

Punjab education minister Aruna Chaudhary claimed that there are more than 800 primary schools, which have expressed their desire to start the English-medium. ""But, seeing that the primary schools have limited resources, we are not forcing them. Soon we will have a figure of primary schools too where English medium is being started and we will release it,"" she said.

A teacher said that logically there is no use of starting English as the medium of instruction from Class VI, if a student has studied in Punjabi from Class I-V. ""The purpose is solved only if the English medium starts right from Class I,"" he said.

However, only maths and science will be taught in English, even in the schools adopting the language as their medium of instruction, from this year, while social studies will be continued to be taught in Punjabi. This decision, as per the orders, has been taken ""on the advise of subject experts in State Council of Educational Research and Training"".

""This is nothing more than confusing the students to make them study general science in English and social studies in Punjabi,"" said another teacher.

The orders further read that the English-medium books are under printing and will reach the schools soon. Teachers have been instructed to ""widely publicise' the English-medium government schools and increase enrollment. Teachers will also undergo a training to teach in English medium.

Till now UP Board text books are taught in these schools and students preparing for competitions have to read NCERT text books separately. The curriculum will be applicable from next academic session as books have not been purchased yet, sources in Basic Shiksha department told HT.

""It is responsibility of the government to educate its people. For the betterment of students in primary schools we have decided to introduce NCERT curriculum,"" said Yogi while addressing a public meeting in Siddharth Nagar after launching the two programmes. He also inaugurated a newly constructed 100 bed maternity ward at district hospital and laid foundation stones of 34 projects worth Rs 52 crores.

He also told the crowd that the government had approved construction of a medical college at Siddharth Nagar and an official announcement will be made soon.

The CM appreciated efforts of those government officials who had adopted and developed schools. He urged public representatives and other government officials to follow suit. Yogi, who distributed school dresses, books and shoes to children, said that under his government 1.54 crore children had enrolled in primary schools last year.

Elaborating about the Dastak scheme, the CM said it was launched in association with Unicef with an aim to check deaths caused by encephalitis by raising awareness about the disease, its causes and prevention. He asked people to contribute for the success of the fortnight-long Dastak programme by getting children between the age group of 5 to 15 years vaccinated under the scheme.

""A large number of children are affected by encephalitis in Gorakhpur and Basti. Don't they have a right to live,"" he said. The chief minister said over 92 lakh children in 38 districts of UP were vaccinated against Japanese Encephalitis (JE) and 86,000 students who had missed the vaccination will be covered this time.

Later speaking at Pipraich, the CM claimed that mortality rate due to encephalitis had come down from 25% earlier to 11% in 2017 and said it had to be brought down further to 0%.

He also told the crowd that over 1000 students had enrolled in schools on the first day of 'School Chalo Abhiyan.'

Yogi also visited a dalit slum in Subhashnagar and took stock of sanitation arrangement. He also laid foundation stones of 13 projects and inaugurated three projects.

CM SUSPENDS CMO, FOUR COPS FOR LAXITY

Cracking the whip against officials for laxity in discharging their duties, chief minister Yogi Adityanath suspended Siddharth Nagar CMO Dr Ved Prakash Sharma, SHO Itwa Anil Kumar, S-I Itwa and two police constables on Monday.

District magistrate Siddharth Nagar Kunal S Ilku also reportedly faced the ire of CM for administration's failure on various fronts.

As per reports, action against the CMO was taken when he failed to give satisfactory reply to the CM over his failure to ensure door-to-door encephalitis vaccination under 'Dastak Abhiyan.' Action against police officials came on the complaint of a local woman -- Geeta Devi -- who managed to attract Yogi's attention by waving a piece of paper while sitting among the audience during his public meeting in Siddharth Nagar. The CM called Geeta Devi on the stage and she told him that her neighbour was not letting her raise a wall on her piece of land. When she complained to the police, they did not take action and forced her to put a thumb impression on a sulahnama (agreement). On her complaint, the CM issued suspension orders of four cops and asked the SP to resolve her issues.

Speaking later to media, on the issue of 'Bharat Bandh', Yogi said his government had sympathy with the Dalits and added 'spreading anarchy and disruption in the name of protest is not right.'"

With the craze for English-medium schools growing, all eyes will be on government-run 5,000 English-medium primary schools which will become operational with the launch of School Chalo Abhiyan on Monday, minister of state for basic education Anupama Jaiswal said on Sunday.

""Parents queue up for English-medium schools. So we thought why not have government-run English-medium schools to cater to the demand. We will run English-medium schools in each block to provide free education to children,"" she said.

Officials of education department and principals of schools are using social media to promote English-medium schools for admissions.

According to education department officials, the decision was taken as there was a huge demand for English-medium schools.

""The move will give fresh impetus to education in UP. We have identified teachers and have given them postings. The move will encourage parents to withdraw their children from private schools and send them to government-run institutions,"" the minister said.

The government has set up five English-medium schools in each block in all the 75 districts of the state. There are over 820 blocks in UP.

""Instead of setting up new schools, the government has converted existing schools to English-medium institutions after giving training to teachers and providing English books,"" said director, basic education, Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh.

He said efforts would be made to ensure that proper English was taught to students.

""Two years ago, the Samajwadi Party government had set up two such schools in every district of the state and the response was overwhelming. The attendance of students went up. This prompted the BJP government to plan more such schools in the state,"" an official said."

The department, however, has made it mandatory for these schools to employ a sufficient number of qualified teachers, trained ayahs and other supporting staff for the safety of children.

While managements acknowledged the emphasis on infrastructure and safety measures, they said that the department should have also looked into the issue of curriculum, textbooks and teacher training for pre-primary sections.

""The pre-primary section is crucial as the brain development of a child happens at the age of two-andhalf years to five years. While the government has accorded recognition, it has failed to acknowledge the need for a uniform curriculum for the most crucial period of a child's growth,"" said S Madhusudan, founder of a 30-year-old private school that recently secured recognition.

Due to government's failure in framing a uniform curriculum, managements claim, they are forced to adopt the syllabus published by private players. ""Private players have framed pre-primary curriculum using the Montessori method, which is adopted by a majority of the schools. Others frame their own curriculum by teaching basics such as the alphabet and numbers,"" said Srinivas Reddy, president of the Telangana State Recognised School Managements Association.

In fact, according to a report on the Indian Early Childhood Education Impact in Telangana compiled by Unicef, the absence of standard curriculum has affected the learning levels of children as the quality of pre-school education in the state is inappropriate for a child's development. ""Low school readiness levels in children are clearly related to the quality of pre-school education. The large scale service providers do not use age and developmentally appropriate curriculum, methods and materials to engage children,"" stated the report.

In 2016, the Telangana government had proposed the framing of a curriculum for pre-primary classes. However, sources said the proposal has failed to see the light of the day yet.

The ministry of human resource development has set an annual deadline of March 31to improve the quality of schools in every state by upgrading their facilities in compliance with the key provisions of the RTE, including drinking water facilities, libraries, toilets, buildings, etc.

Educationists said the government had promised to fulfil the infrastructure requirements that were prescribed in the RTE. However, that hasn't been done and due to this, the quality of education is being affected in state schools. Now, the government is shutting down schools for lack of quality.

Educationist Nihal Kirnalli said, ""The most shocking aspect of the survey is the decline in functional toilets for girls in schools. It has gone down to 96.8% from 99.4% in the last three years. How does the state even claim that it is empowering the girl child? This is ridiculous and it seems the government is lying. The facts on the ground prove it.""

In fact, I was surprised by things that were good. About 75% students in the age group of 14-18 years can read at least Class 2 textbooks. This is also the number of students who can read Class 2 textbooks at age 14, according to regular ASER. Which means that after 14 years, the number does not drop. Because if you're not using your literacy, you can forget how to read, it is possible. But that doesn't happen and that was a good thing.

Also, the fluency rate grew by 7-8 percentage points within the total number of readers. We also found that 7-8 percentage point more young people, than at age 14, can read at least a sentence in English. So, even though nobody is teaching you English formally, the number seems to increase. This was both interesting and surprising and will help us in the long run.

In math or arithmetic, on the other hand, the number of children who can do division or just about do division remains at 41-42% in the 14-18 age group. That is where the issues come up.

Let's take the example of bank loans. Now say one bank is giving you a loan at 11% interest and another at 13%. Which bank will you choose? 70% students chose the right bank. But if they are told that a shirt for '300 is available on 10% discount, only 40% could figure out the cost of the shirt.

Now, this is a problem because it is a generation which is being told that you can have bank accounts, Jan-Dhan Yojana etc. A large number of this demographic has bank accounts and has been depositing money. A large number of women too deposit money in banks. They've not used ATMs, but they are being told about e-banking, mobile payments etc. But if you don't know what the calculations are or you don't have support systems to do the calculations, then how are you going to figure it out?

So, there are a lot of warning flags out there. When it comes to general knowledge, a large number of kids could not identify their state or its capital on the map of India. I don't know what to make of that. In an ASER pilot test survey, many years ago, we asked kids who the man on the currency note, with no hair and a pair of glasses was. A lot of kids did not know who the man was. When we asked them who they thought it could be, some of them said, 'It must be the person who got the notes printed'.

UMA VISHNU: You have sent out these warning signals for very long now but why is it that there is still confusion about ways to fix the problem?

I can tell you how the debates went. For example, in 2004-05, when UPA-I came to power, the NCERT made an effort to create a National Curriculum Framework. That was an excellent exercise... It was a mass-scale effort of a lot of educationists. They talked about constructivism etc. But today, 12 years later, the language that was generated in the NCERT then has not percolated to lower levels. Translating the principles into practice proved to be difficult. Back then we were saying that we should start by setting small goals and achieving them... If you think that everyone will be able to follow your philosophy of constructivism, it might not work.

In the early days, no one was willing to talk about 'learning outcomes'. For the first time, in the 12th Five-Year Plan, the Planning Commission said learning outcomes were important; till then, the HRD Ministry would not listen. After 2012, 'learning outcomes' has become a buzzword in the ministry too. We would like to take some credit for that.

Now, NCERT has come out with a long list for grade-wise learning outcomes to be achieved, which is going to the other extreme. See, children need to learn to read. If I ask a kid to stand here and read, either the kid can read or he can't. Or they can read a little bit. You can't create a grade or scale of 10 or 15. It should be something so simple and transparent that even parents can understand.

What NCERT has done is create an 'educationist' standard of learning outcomes which is very difficult to understand for a lay person. Reading may be fine but it becomes difficult with mathematics. If you see the survey published by NCERT, the list for learning outcomes for maths is very long and detailed at every grade. If someone asks the teacher, 'Does this child know maths?' and your reply is, 'This child understands angles and regular fractions', it becomes difficult to understand.

I am firmly on the side of the parents and the children -- start with a big, bold approach. But this is not accepted by everybody. There is an argument that it should be done holistically. We don't mind that, but how do you do it? I think we are stuck in what a lot of people used to call best being the enemy of the good. Everybody wants the best. (But) there is confusion. If 70% of children are not going to go beyond Class 10, then only 15-20% will pursue graduation. Then, what is important? That most become the best in science or most learn foundational knowledge?

Even for employment, whether in the organised or unorganised sector, employers are seeking people who are trainable or are willing to absorb training. We don't need a ready-made product for everything, but somebody who can absorb instructions, understand situations and work. We have not been able to create that product.

How do you create that product? It's a very simple thing, but it is in conflict with our ideals of what education should be. That is where the confusion lies. We want to universally create ideal types and we are not able to do so. Ideal or so-called good education today is only for people who can pay more money, and even there it is not ideal.

When you send your children to air-conditioned, elite schools after spending a lot of money, you still pay for tutors that the child goes to in the afternoon. I have never been able to figure out their need for tutors. In Pune, where I live now, I am told a number of schools have private coaching classes inside the school where high school children go for maths and science. Why bother teaching the same syllabus twice? Why not leave the two subjects for private tutors alone? They seem to have hit upon a practical solution. I would love to give the students and their parents an option between regular school classes and private coaching.

RAVISH TIWARI: Through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) and Right to Education, are we trying to make up for the fact that in the initial years after Independence, the focus was more on higher education than on primary education?

To understand the backwardness in access to education, we have to understand the fact that the population has grown three-four folds since Independence. That's a huge jump. So, you need more schools, more teachers and so on. Except the BIMARU states, all other states achieved 80-90% access to primary education by the '90s. Yes, we could have done better. I think the problem was in the North. There were more socio-political problems in these parts than purely economic ones. Even today, the most backward states, educationally, are those in the BIMARU belt. We did not focus on this belt. The possible reason for that is we should have made (education) a fundamental right at the time of Independence. We said we'll wait for 10 more years and then it never happened.

The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was launched in 2002 and ASER measured the issue of access in 2005 -- 92.4% of the children said that they are enrolled in a school, although that's not to say that they are attending classes every day. The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was launched when most of the work was done. The SSA helped in the last mile, and from 92.4% enrollment, (the access) has gone up to 96 % maximum. It's not 100% as yet.

The problem is that we focused on the IITs and primary schools, not on institutions in between the two. For example, we should have realised that we will need more teachers given the rate at which our population is growing. And, this is not just an Indian problem. It's not just the politicians or the education system that is to be blamed. Everybody around the world took it for granted that schooling equals learning. Once ASER started coming out with data, a lot of people started saying that this holds true (at least) for the developing world and that schooling isn't always equal to learning.

After World War II, everybody was talking about universal primary education and ways to achieve it -- open schools, appoint teachers, give books free of cost and education will be taken care of. We pointed out that just opening a school and appointing teachers is not enough, especially when you're universalising it and creating a mass base. It can work when you have a smaller number of children but when the population is growing at this rate, you need to do something more. I think the quality issue is linked to access and a lot of things could have been done and they can still be done.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: When we talk about learning outcomes, what role does a teacher have? It is believed that many of them are in the profession because they didn't get through anything else. How does one change that?

People say that when you become an actor, you can learn to act. So you can become a teacher and then get better at it. Even if you're not a great teacher, becoming a reasonably good teacher is not all that difficult. I believe this. I have seen many young people join the teaching profession. There might be a thing such as, 'Aur kuchch nahin to teaching kar lo (If nothing, one can teach)', but once they start working, they want to do a good job. This again is a belief of mine -- people want to be good at what they do. Not the best maybe, but at least good at what they're doing. Young teachers join with hope, optimism and enthusiasm, but it's the system that kills them in no time.

If you look at our survey, in the age group of 14-18 years, 12-14% children have said they want to be teachers.... I think there are ways in which you can get people to work. If you treat teachers like government servants, they will behave like government servants.

In today's age, I would insist on telling young people that it doesn't matter what you do for a living. That's not you. You must have basic abilities to be able to earn a living and there's nothing wrong in doing whatever job you get. But do it well. People run after permanent jobs... but now many know that there is no such thing as a permanent job. You do something to earn a living but that's not you. You need to nurture your hobbies and other skills.

KAUSHIK DAS GUPTA: You talked about getting one's basics right. Do our basics also need to be reformulated?

It has to be. According to the Census 2011, India is 75% literate. By 2020, we will have 85% -- close to 100% -- literacy. But the method to measure literacy was formulated in the middle of the 20th century. We need to urgently change that definition of literacy. Much has changed. We need digital literacy. We need the ability to learn. Reading has to be a fundamental skill, it needs to be taught in schools. If you don't teach it, it's not a skill that a child will develop naturally. The way we teach maths may have to change if everyone needs to become financially literate.

Many children are not able to do simple division sums. Hence, they lose interest. So I created a game called 'Kal Ka Looter' in our digital initiative. It was actually a calculator. It asks questions like, 'If there are 64 chocolates and 16 friends, how many chocolates will each get?' Nobody knows the multiplication table of 16 and the students must have thought, 'what's the deal with tables, just eat the chocolates'. But if you give them a calculator alongside the sum, the kids will talk among themselves and decipher the buttons and figure out 64/16. It is cooperative learning, it is not cheating.

UMA VISHNU: So you are saying that we should invert the way we teach? Give students calculators first and then teach them basic mathematics?

No. The idea is to get the children interested in something. How do we learn? Right now the system says read this, sit quietly and don't ask questions. But if I get interested in it, I might want to learn. My idea is that when people want to learn, there should be avenues available for learning. But they should first want to learn. And we should bring the children to a point where they would want to learn. There is no 'want' right now, there is just learning by rote so that you can pass Class 10.

The objective should be that anybody who wants to learn anything, anytime, should be able to. That should be made possible. In English, Wikipedia has unlimited scope, but how many people are contributing to the Hindi, Marathi or Nepali Wiki? Very less... We are not putting out knowledge in these languages. The solution then proposed is to teach everybody English. I do not think that is the right solution.

ABANTIKA GHOSH: If calculators are made available, why do we then need to teach addition, subtraction and multiplication?

Basically, mathematics is about learning patterns, relationships, logic, discovering it etc. But that doesn't happen now. I am not saying don't teach students addition, subtraction, multiplication; there is a thrill in numbers, there's poetry in mathematics. Some people will find it extremely difficult to think that there is poetry in mathematics.

The other day, (tabla player) Zakir Hussain was speaking in Gurgaon and, I think, the way a tabla player can explain mathematical patterns, nobody else can. Why we don't use that as a resource is beyond me. So, it is the attitude towards learning that needs to change. Once you finish school and college that's when real learning seems to start.

ARANYA SHANKAR: In January this year, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said CCTV cameras would be installed in all Delhi government schools within three months, giving parents access to their children in class on a real-time basis.

Personally, I do not agree with it. This thought -- that CCTV surveillance is going to make you safer -- is useless. Is that the kind of society we want? Teachers need to be responsible, they need to create good learning atmosphere in schools... That is more important than anybody installing CCTV cameras. You can't have proper surveillance in banks, what will you do by installing CCTVs in schools?

SOMYA LAKHANI: Anganwadi workers and helpers have been demanding, among other things, an increase in honorarium, health insurance and pension after retirement. They earn very little, about '5,000 per month. Do you think this model is going to fail?

This treatment of anganwadi workers as volunteers is not right. But then there is the other question -- if you make them government servants, will they even work? You don't know how that will play out. Workers should get paid -- they can't survive on Rs 3,000-5000. Some people may argue that they only work for three hours etc. But there is need for them to work longer hours to look after kids. We need day-care centres.

Also, are there jobs being created, especially for non-skilled people? That's a big question. When people are not treated well, there will be anger, and this is a large group of people. The government will have to take a call. They will have to take a second look at the anganwadi model.

UMA VISHNU: One of the criticisms about ASER is that your data is processed, that you don't put out raw data.

We have put up a six-page list of people who have accessed ASER data since 2013 on www.asercentre.org. What do our critics mean by raw data? There are some who want us to give them names of villages and children who are a part of the survey data-set. This is not done. But we do release 'raw data' after removing identifiers such as village and other names. In any survey, you don't disclose personal details for a number of reasons."

Sources said that some applicants have expressed their eagerness to open a Konkani or Marathi-medium primary school even if no state grants are extended to them.

DoE officials are worried that this could act as a backdoor entry for English-medium primary schools, as the institutions, after getting permission to open the school, may switch their medium of instruction at a later stage.

Officials are worried that, if a school starts without grants, it will be under no obligation to continue teaching in a regional language and are therefore set to give preference to schools that are counting on state grants to operate.

Educational bodies and trusts that want to start English-medium primary schools have to clear a number of criteria. Mainly these schools should not be in proximity to regional language government or aided primary schools so as to rule out eating into their student share. For those who want to open Konkani or Marathi-medium primary schools, the state has relaxed this distance criteria. Additionally, Konkani and Marathi primary schools also get special grants per child to operate.

As a result of this policy, between 2012 and 2016, over 90 regional language primary schools were allowed to begin operations. However, no English-medium school was given clearance due to the ongoing row over grants to English-medium primary schools.

For the academic year 2018-19, DoE has received 61 applications to open new primary schools in the state. Of these, 24 applications are from educational institutions and trusts to open Konkani-medium schools, 14 to start Marathi-medium schools, seven to begin Urdumedium institutions and one to open a Sindhi language school.

Another 15 institutes and trusts have sought permissions to open English-medium schools from June 2018."

Of the 61 applications received for new primary schools in the state, 24 are from educational institutions and trusts for starting Konkani schools in the state, 14 for Marathi medium schools, seven for Urdu, one for Sindi and 15 for English medium. Director of education G P Bhat told TOI , ""We have forwarded all the applications to the additional district education inspector (ADEI) for a feasibility report.""

Bhat said that last year they had not given permission to start any new primary school based on the government policy that there is no need for more.

The applications to start schools are from Mapusa, Vasco, Betim, Margao, Ponda, Tiswadi, Dharbandora, Canacona, Porvorim and Tambdi Surla, among others. The last date for sending in applications was extended from November 30, 2017, to January 31 this year. A senior government officer said that the English primary schools' applications would be directly rejected because it is against the state policy.

The policy encourages primary education in the mother tongue.

""We have not asked additional district education inspector (ADEI) to give a feasibility study for the English medium primary schools,"" a senior government officer said.

The senior government officer said the directorate of education's stand is clear-the government should not grant more permissions to primary schools as there are already an excess. Government schools are being closed, many have lower enrolment. ""There is no need to give more permission for schools,"" senior government officer said.

The government officer said that over the last three years there have been a lot of applications to start Urdu schools from societies and trusts. ""As per law once we receive the applications for new a primary school we asked the ADEI to inspect the site and give a feasibility report and based on the DoE take a call on applications,"" the senior government officer said, adding that in most cases there are objections from the existing schools.

The officer said that first permission is granted to start the school and the following year, after inspecting the school to verify the teachers and students enrolled, it is given recognition."

The primary section will be extended from Class 4 till Class 5 while secondary section from Class 7 to Class 8.

This move has come so that students do not leave school mid way and continue till secondary section. Currently, students quit BMC schools after completion of primary section (Class 4) and opt for another state or private school. This has increased the drop out rate and reduced enrolment rate in civic-run schools.

By extending the sections students will not move to new schools. Shubhada Gudekar, Chairperson of BMC Education committee, said, ""We will extend classes so that students can have a one stop solution in our schools."" In addition, parents complained about lack of facilities in these schools. Nitesh Diwan, a parent said, ""Various facilities like benches, uniforms and meals are not appropriate in BMC schools. This discourages us to enrol our children.""

From this academic year, the BMC will provide monsoon boots, nutritional snacks and sports uniform for free to students. ""These facilities will be provided along with the 27 objects that are given to students at the start of academic year,"" Gudekar added.

In addition, BMC teachers will now be posted in schools near their vicinity. This has come to reduce travel stress of teachers.

This idea was suggested by the education committee of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to encourage the students to continue in the BMC without taking any intermediate break. There are a total of 1,038 primary schools and 149 secondary BMC schools in Mumbai.

""Students tend to drop out as many primary and secondary schools end at Class 4 and Class 7 respectively. Parents need to enrol their students in other schools if there is no class further, which they tend to avoid, as it is an additional burden for them.

This way, students drop out of the schools, which affects their academic life,"" said Shubhada Gudekar, chairperson of BMC education committee.

Ms Gudekar has asked the BMC education department to extend the primary as well as the secondary section from the academic year 2018-19, which will begin from June.

Along with this, several parents of the BMC school students complained to the department about lack of accountability when it comes to providing 27 items such as like bags, books, uniforms, stationery and shoes, which should be given at the beginning of the academic year but is not being done on time. This causes parents to shift the child to privately managed schools.

""This year, our aim is to bring maximum enrolments,"" Mahesh Palkar, the BMC education officer said.

All primary schools in Goa will then run in Konkani.""

That was the vision held aloft by the late Ravindra Kelekar, a stalwart of modern Konkani literature, through his presidential address at the Akhil Bhartiya Konkani Sahitya Sammelan held in Panaji on November 16-17, 1969.

His sense of conviction about the success of Konkani in primary education emanated from the superlative quality of textbooks prepared by Konkani-lovers, through their labour of love post-liberation, after the then government of free Goa gave its nod for Konkani to be taught in primary schools.

""When the question of primary schools first arose in Goa after it gained Swaraj, some of us Konkani lovers insisted that Konkani should definitely go into primary education. There weren't any Konkani textbooks then, and hardly any other books as well in Konkani. Besides, we had no experience at all of what would be the fate of the students taking education in Konkani. But we knew of just one principle too well -- that a child should be imparted education only in its own language, that the Goa government should accept this universally acknowledged principle...,"" Kelekar explained in his address.

He went on to say that for children studying in Konkani, the benefits are three-fold -- there's a phenomenal rise in their grasping power, there's substantial increase in their thirst for knowledge, and they gain immense potential for self-expression.

""If you want Goa's children to be educated in the real sense of the term, then don't cede Konkani's space to any other language -- no matter how mighty the language is or how dire the need be.""

That was exactly 49 years ago.

Three decades before that, the first Konkani Parishad held in 1939, through several resolutions passed at the conference, had called upon the government to make provision for imparting primary education through the medium of Konkani in Devanagiri script.

Since then, the issue has been passionately discussed and debated at forums of the Parishad, but the dream of Konkani getting the dominant space in primary education in Goa has remained only a distant dream. The Konkani movement suffered a major setback when in 2011 the state government changed its policy to extend grants to English medium primary schools, and subsequently in 2017 when the BJP-led government failed to reverse the policy, despite vehement protests from the Konkani brigade.

""For Konkani, the major jolt is the shift in the medium of instruction,"" says Damodar Mauzo. ""People prefer to send their wards for primary education to either Marathi medium or the English. Marathi because it has been a tradition, and English because it is trendy. Masses that follow the classes blindly believe that their wards will immensely benefit by this shift, not realising that the ward will never master the 'other' language.""

The Sahitya Akademi award winner attempts to feel the pulse of the younger generation which has drifted away from Konkani. ""Goa is fast turning into a city state with its fast paced urbanisation. The common dream of the youth is to go abroad or aboard ship. Greener pastures woo them and hence, they feel no need of the proficiency in Konkani. In view of this confusing situation, the second-generation classes are seen moving away from the language of the soil. The masses are seen blindly following the classes that are in favour of English in public and at home.""

The debate now veers to the role of various Konkani institutions in the state in their task of turning the tide. Have they done enough to hold aloft Kelekar's vision of Konkani education before the masses? Despite starkly contrasting views, Konkani intelligentsia agree on one count -- that they have miles to go before the goal is reached.

The son of migrants from Pakistan, Umesh Malhotra had never been to a village before. A graduate from IIT Madras, he started his career with Infosys and was among the first hundred employees of the company. A few years later, a friend took him on a trip to the hinterlands of Rajasthan. There, he found himself sitting before a group of about 10 women, their faces hidden under long ghoonghats, but very vocal about the dismal state of education for their children in the villages.

That is when Umesh changed gears after a good many years in IT, and began his first foray into preschool learning. Starting with one school, 10 children and one teacher, within a year the strength went up to 80 children and three teachers. In 2011, he set up Hippocampus learning centres with the aim of providing quality education to rural children from low income families.

Currently, the company runs more than 300 preschools and 11 primary schools in Karnataka and Maharashtra, educating more than 11,000 students. It uses international standards of teaching and sets goals for reading, writing, arithmetic and English learning. The smile on the children's faces, he says, is his greatest reward."

No, that isn't a joke. An RTI query has revealed that many teachers recruited by government schools in the last ten years are doing exactly that.

The query, seeking details of all teachers in Punjab government schools, was made by Harpreet Singh Sandhu, the sarpanch of Mohrewala village in Ferozepur. He is also the vice-president of Social Reformers, an NGO that has been trying to find out why the performance of students in these schools has declined in the past few years and why parents do not want to send their children to such institutions.

Punjab embarrassment

Although information has so far been received only from ten districts, the data show that 313 teachers teaching in various government primary schools did not clear their math, science, English, social science or Hindi papers in Class X.

In Moga, 59 teachers are teaching the subject they had failed in -- 31 are teaching math, 10 English, six science, one Hindi and 11 social science.

In Muktsar, there are 50 such teachers, of whom 28 had failed in math, nine in English, three in science and 10 in social sciences. In Fazilka, 31 are teaching the subject they failed in, while in Ferozepur, there are 46. Sandhu said the data clearly showed why the results of these schools were on the decline."

Rupani who inaugurated a Swaminarayan girls school in Mandvi taluka in Bhuj said that the girl child education in the state was 57% which has now reached 70% due to the efforts of the government as well as programmes like the Kanya Kedavani. ""With the support of the society we will very soon take the education for girls to 100 per cent,"" said Rupani.

The school, spread over an area of nine acres, has been built at a cost of Rs16 crore and will accommodate over 1,200 students.

Rupani said the government will also provide 250 primary schools to the state with digital virtual classrooms. This he said was part of the government's efforts to improve digital learning in schools. Talking about the initiatives of the government, he said 57,000 government schools in the state now had new classrooms, better infrastructure including toilet blocks and drinking water facilities.

The Bhuj Swaminarayan Temple also donated Rs5 lakh to the government's Kanya Kelavani fund. Rupani said the sect had set a precedent in taking up educational and health initiatives in the state.

Rupani reminded that the Kanya Kedavani, a scheme to encourage and improve girls child participation in school and reduce the school dropout among girl students was the brainchild of prime minister Narendra Modi when he was the Chief Minister of Gujarat

It should be noted that the Kanya Kelavani programme along with the Shala Praveshotsav has in the decade since it was launched helped improve school enrollment in Gujarat. The programmes include ministers and government officials spreading out in pre-assigned districts during the opening of the school year and interacting with students and parents, encouraging them to continue education."
