A bench consisting of Dharam Chand Chaudhary and Chander Bhusan Barowalia instructed the department's director to file an affidavit which shall detail the mechanism regarding the complaint in the state schools, as reported by Indian Express.

An order was passed by the bench which dismissed the appeal by a teacher whose absence was treated by authorities as 'dies non.' The term 'dies non' implies a day which is not treated as a day on duty. The period while qualifying as service for increments or pension benefits, is not constituted as a break in service.

The bench, in its order, asked the director regarding any mechanism which was enforced by the department to ensure whether the teachers attended the schools regularly and did not proceed on leave without it being sanctioned. Furthermore, the bench enquired on the provision of informing the school in case of teacher's emergency leave"
