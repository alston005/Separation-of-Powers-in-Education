Defence procurements, according to the Court, impacting India's security interests, unlike other contracts, require a somewhat different standard of scrutiny. Within the contours of that standard, the Supreme Court was broadly satisfied with the government's position.

There are several undisputed facts in the public domain, which make the Rafale purchases highly suspect. Let me state some of them. On March 13, 2015, Dassault and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) finalised the work-share contract thereby signalling that the deal was through. On March 25, 2015, Dassault CEO, Eric Trappier was in Bengaluru with the chairman, HAL and Chief of Air Staff ready to take the contract forward. In a press conference in France wherein our ambassador was present, Trappier stated that 95 per cent of the deal had been finalised and the balance 5 per cent would follow soon.

These facts militate against the Court's opinion that problems between Dassault and HAL led to the prime minister's decision on April 10, 2015 when he announced the purchase of 36 Rafale off the shelf. The chairman of HAL has publicly stated that there was no impediment in the deal between Dassault and HAL, and that the notings on the file, if made public, would clarify all issues. It is also a matter of public record that the sub-stratum of the contract had been modified from a private arrangement to an Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA). Under the guidelines, before entering into an IGA, its terms and conditions would have to be negotiated through a Contract Negotiating Committee and the Price Negotiating Committee, after which it required clearance from the Defence Advisory Council. Thereafter, it had to be approved by the Cabinet Committee on Security. None of this happened on April 10, 2015 when the prime minister made the public announcement.

Supreme Court judgment has not settled the issue. In fact, it has raised more questions than it has answeredminister's announcement. The Court erroneously came to the conclusion that Reliance was in negotiation since 2012 not realising that at that time Reliance Industries wished to diversify its operations from gas exploration to manufacturing the wings of the Falcon aircraft -- a project which was given up, and had nothing to do with RDL. Another matter in the public domain is that Reliance Aerostructure Ltd. (RAL), the joint venture partner of Dassault was incorporated on April 24, 2015. Trappier publicly stated that this joint venture was entered into in April, 2015. Obviously, the venture must have been put in place between April 25 and April 30. RAL, upon incorporation, had no assets, no capital, no experience and no land. Why would Dassault, within five days of incorporation of RAL, agree to a joint venture unless it was pre-meditated and concluded under instructions?

Advertising

Trappier justified the joint venture on the basis that Reliance had land near the airport, making the operation easier. HAL, said Trappier, had no such facilities near the airport in Bengaluru. Both the statements are false. Reliance applied for land only on June 16, 2015, whereas HAL already had huge tracts of land near the airport, much prior to April, 2015.

The files would, in fact, tell a story of their own. They might show that key stakeholders including the defence minister, insisted on a Letter of Guarantee. They might also reflect opposition to the PMO's attempts to interfere in the process. In any event, the truth would have emerged had the Supreme Court summoned the files and taken note of the proceedings reflected in their movement. Once the prime minister had already committed himself to the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter aircraft, the process that followed could not have overridden his unilateral decision. How can this process ever be deemed to be consistent with any guidelines?

Another serious issue that needs attention is why the Supreme Court opined that former French President François Hollande's statement has been denied by President Emmanuel Macron, who, on the contrary, when asked, could not comment on it since he was not present at the meeting. Surprisingly, Hollande's statement has not been denied by the prime minister. I am sure, minutes of this bilateral meeting, which are normally recorded, will reflect what happened. Trappier, who also was not present in the meeting, cannot possibly be privy to any such statement. Therefore, for the Supreme Court to say that President Hollande's statement is denied is not borne out by any record.

The fact that the prime minister made this announcement without the knowledge of the defence minister, the foreign minister or the Indian ambassador in France or, for that matter, Dassault, suggests that the prime minister took this decision unilaterally without taking into confidence key stakeholders. Once the nature of the contract was changed to an IGA, then willy-nilly there had to be a government guarantee for the execution of the contract instead of a letter of comfort.

Without doubt, the waters are muddied and the truth is yet to be told -- how and when, only time will tell. The Supreme Court judgment has, in no way, settled the issue. In fact, it has raised more questions than it has answered. The Court has always upheld principles of transparency and maintained that every decision must be informed, otherwise it cannot pass the test of reasonableness.

In the past, Article 32 has not constrained the Supreme Court to direct investigations after en-masse cancellation of telecom licenses and coal allocations. I guess, both public perception and the perception of judges change from time to time. Consistency in decision-making may not be a virtue but inconsistency, sometimes, may also not be a sign of judicial wisdom. Judicial wisdom, in changed circumstances, must not be at the cost of the Court's credibility.

Markets regulator Sebi has slapped a penalty of Rs 25 lakh on Raghav Commodities for executing fraudulent trades, which created artificial volumes in the illiquid stock options segment on the BSE.

Sebi conducted an investigation into the trading activities of certain entities from April 2014 to September 2015 after observing large-scale reversal of trades in the BSE's stock options segment.

The probe found that more than 81 per cent of all the trades executed were the ones, which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counter-parties in a contract.

Raghav Commodities was among the various entities involved in non-genuine trades as it had indulged in execution of reversal of trades in stock options with same entities on the same day, the regulator noted.

""The scheme, plan, device and artifice employed by the Noticee .... executing reversal trades in illiquid stock options contracts at irrational, unrealistic and unreasonable prices, tantamount to fraud on the securities market in as much as it involves non-genuine/ manipulative transactions in securities and misuse of the securities market,"" Sebi said in an order on Monday.

By doing so, the firm has violated the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.

Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has levied a fine of Rs 25 lakh on Raghav Commodities.

In April, the regulator announced to take action in a phased manner against 14,720 entities for fraudulent trade in illiquid stock options segment and passed several orders in past few weeks against such entities.

Chart courtesy of @Chicagostock:

$ES_F Holding above 3D pivot range, keeping pressure up and forcing buyers to chase. Next major level 2550-2580 to test FOMC high of 2592.

After trading sideways during the overnight session, the S&P 500 futures opened Friday's regular trading hours at 2504.25. The first move after the bell was a rally up to an early high of day at 2509.75, before turing lower and selling off down to the morning low of 2472.75 at 9:45. From there, the ES bounced going into the midday, double topping at 2501.50, and then drifted lower to close out the morning.

The afternoon saw a push lower, down to 2481.75, and then a sudden reversal higher, as strong buy programs came in for the close thrusting the ES up to 2523.00. The reversal eventually failed in the final hour with a selloff down to 2476.75. The benchmark futures contract went on to print 2486.25 on the 3:00 cash close, and setted the day at 2487.00, down -8.00 handles, or -0.32%.

Our View: First, I want to thank and wish all of you for being part of MTS. I really appreciate all the compliments I get from people about the Opening Print. I have been writing it so long that I can't remember how long I have been doing it! Geez, that's not good! I know I was writing it from Dubai every night for almost two weeks on one of the trips to the UAE. when we were doing Sheikh Mohammed futures and options business. I am pretty sure I started writing like 3 or 4 years before that, so it's been at least 26 or 27 years. Eeeee...

I think we all know the retail futures trading industry has been shrinking for years, and over the last two months, with the ES dropping 2% to 3% a day and rallying over 5% in one day, it only adds to the pain. Remember, these are not, and I mean 'NOT', our father markets or charts!

Like I said above, it gets hard to concentrate on trading when there is so much going on at MTS. While I do think I have made some good calls, I also made the call for the year end rally a little too early. I knew that the odds of a Santa Claus rally increase starting the day after Christmas, but I went out two Fridays ago on Twitter and started talking about a 'big pop' coming, and I did it after a big 50 handle rally, and then watched the ES sell off 75 handles.

I can express my frustration with a call like that. I knew how the end of the year stats work, and I also knew that with a 50+ handle rally, or even 100+ handle rally, you're supposed to lean into it. I also have to admit that on two days over the last 3 weeks I lost 1/3rd of my years profits. The PitBull says it to me all the time that we are outgunned, and I have to agree.

There were over 500 clearing firms between the CBOT and the CME when I started on the floor, today there are 23, and only 3 or 4 that will open a retail futures accounts. In most cases the IB's open the accounts because the clearing firm prefers to have a buffer in place. A recent report from the NYSE showed that over 83% of the volume is algorithmic or HFT. Retail traders have to, in essence, take on some of the smartest quants and programmers in the world, places like Renaissance Technologies LLC or Citadel. Im sorry to say this my friends but they don't lose...

Renaissance's Medallion fund, for example, has averaged annual gains of more than 35% since 1990. So, the moral of my story is, while I may call it well trading, it is a whole different game now. You have to have extreme patience, normal moves could have the Dow down 600 to 800 points, or the ES could have a 70 to 80 handle move from high to low. While this maybe the new norm, it really isn't normal at all. In fact, regardless of what others may say, we have never seen an extended period of such extreme volatility. I know, some will say the credit crisis, or 1987, but we never saw continuous 3% daily drops and over 5% rallies in one day.

I usually add my 'In the end' to the bottom of the top part of the Opening Print, but today truly is an end, the last trading day, and last day of 2018. If someone were to ask me to do a very brief overview, the first thing would be that it was Trump's stock market rally and failure. While I am 100% sure the China trade wars definitely have had a very negative effect on the world's stock markets, it's not just China. I would add that while I like Trump, I also am like many of his supporters; I am happy he is looking out for America, but I am not happy with turning global friends and trading partners in to enemies.

This hard nosed push approach where he doesn't listen to any of his staff members recommendations, losing so many key people, and just blasting off on his Twitter has gone from amusing to ludacris. Owning a media company I know how hard it is to keep up with running a company and trading, and the president has a lot more on his hands than I do, but my belief Trump has so many issues he causes 'fruckises', or disruptions, to push the media away from all his investigations only adds to a longer list of problems. Many Trump supports may disagree, but to me it feels like he's on the run. Shutting down the government to procure the money to build the wall isn't hurting our congressmen or senators, its hurting poor families and low-paid workers, and the president's approval rating.

Our view; today is a full trading day, and Tuesday the ES is closed all day, then reopens Tuesday night. The first thing is, most people are taking time off for the holidays. The second thing is, it's the last trading day of the year and the year end rebalance. According to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), investors and traders are looking for a desperately needed respite from market gyrations may have to deal with yet one more ""seismic bout"" of volatility before Dec 31 finally pops up on their calendar dials.

According to Wells, on the close today the pension funds will rebalance / adjust positions between stock and bonds. Last week it was advertised that the 'rebalance' was over $120 billion, but after last weeks late blast up, the number was cut back substantially. For every 1% higher, the pension funds bought $1 billion in stock, thus leaving around $50 to $60 billion to buy. My feeling is that while the ES may really off the buying, most of it will be paired off. I think I am like a lot of folks, I think the ES may rally, I just don't think it will hold. It won't just go up without a few good selloffs. As for 2019... I am going to take this one day at a time.

Lastly, and this is something I have talked about a lot, the liquidity in the futures has dropped to a record low in the #ES, #NQ and #YM futures. The Barclays (LON:BARC) chart above shows how the ES futures 'bid / ask' contract size has dropped to a record low, meaning there could be a pick up in volatility late when the rebalance starts."

Sanchez was signed to much fanfare last January from Arsenal on reportedly the most lucrative contract in Premier League history, but has so far failed to deliver on expectations, scoring just four goals in 30 appearances.

However, Solskjaer believes the more positive approach he has adopted in wins over Cardiff, Huddersfield and Bournemouth to begin his temporary spell in charge until the end of the season will suit Sanchez's game.

""He's a player that would benefit from the rotation (of positions) and movements, and the more chances you create, the more times you get the ball into the final third, he'll be an asset for us,"" said Solskjaer.

""I think he's looking forward to it. It certainly looked like it yesterday (Saturday) in the (training) session because he scored quite a few nice goals, so that's encouraging.""

Solskjaer has been credited for restoring United's principles of attacking football after two-and-a-half seasons with Mourinho's more cautious approach.

Shunned by Mourinho for his final three league games in charge, Paul Pogba has roared back into form by scoring four goals in his last two games, while Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial also appear to be flourishing with more freedom to attack.

However, Solskjaer insisted he is only implementing what he learned for 11 seasons as a player under Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford.

United's decline in the past five years has coincided with Ferguson's retirement and Solskjaer said he invited the club's most successful manager to visit his players and coaching staff, which includes one of Ferguson's former assistants Mike Phelan, at United's Carrington training ground.

""I do keep him informed. He visited us yesterday (Saturday) and I think he enjoyed his time at the training ground,"" said Solskjaer.

""We had a nice few chats and he encouraged us. He knows we are Man Utd through and through and we want to do whatever we can up to the last second we are here.

Conteh was detained along with Sannah Marrah, the defence ministry's former director general, at the Criminal Investigation Department on Friday.

Both face charges, the Sierra Leone Anti-Corruption Commission said. The commission added officials are investigating allegations of corruption over procurement of military vehicles, uniforms and rice in 2015 in a procurement contract worth a reported USD 10 million.

On his release, Conteh was received by jubilant opposition party supporters holding placards and singing political victory songs in the capital Freetown.

President Julius Maada Bio succeeded Koroma nine months ago after a tumultuous election campaign in which he targeted corruption, ending a decade-long rule by the APC.

Soon after he took office a government report commissioned said ""rampant corruption"" in the former administration had led to the ""near collapse"" of the West African nation's economy.

After a recent enforcement drive found that Delhi government contractors were not paying workers the increased minimum wages as notified on November 1, the Labour Department on Monday issued an advisory to all heads of department to make sure the staff are paid minimum wages.

In the advisory issued by the office of the Secretary-cum-Labour Commissioner, with approval of Labour Minister Gopal Rai, the Department said a special enforcement drive was carried out from December 10-21.

""During the drive, statements of workers/employees taken reveals that outsourced workers employed by contractors in Govt. establishments/Govt. hospitals are not being notified rates of minimum wages which are effective from 01.11.2018 [sic],"" the advisory read.

Citing the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970, and the Minimum Wages Act, 1948, the department said it was the statutory duty of the principal employer to ensure that the outsourced workers are paid minimum wages.

Asking all heads of department to ensure the payment of minimum wages, the advisory stated: ""Any violation to these provisions attracts prosecution/challans under the relevant provisions of labour laws both against the Principal Employer as well as the Contractor [sic].""

According to the Minimum Wages (Delhi) Amendment Act, 2017, the fine for failure to pay minimum wages is ₹50,000 and/or a prison term of up to three years. Earlier, the fine was ₹500.

Starting from November 1, 2018, the daily minimum wages are ₹538 per day or ₹14,000 per month for unskilled workers; ₹592 per day or ₹15,400 per month for semi-skilled workers; and ₹692 per day or ₹16,962 per month for skilled workers."

Spot gold traded at $1,279.41 per ounce late on Monday, on track to end 2018 down nearly 1.8 percent, while the most-active gold futures contract settled 2018 down 4.2 percent at $1,281.30 an ounce.

In contrast, spot palladium is set to gain nearly 19 percent this year, as a global deficit pushed prices of the autocatalyst metal above those of bullion in brief spurts for the first time in 16 years, out-performing other major precious metals.

U.S. palladium futures ended 2018 up 18.3 percent at $1,197.20 an ounce, its third straight year of gains.

Meanwhile, sister metal platinum, was expected to finish the year down 14 percent .

Platinum, more heavily used in the diesel vehicles that have fallen out of favour since the Volkswagen emissions-rigging scandal broke in 2015, fell below palladium for the fist time last year.

Tracking gold's trajectory was spot silver , set to fall 9 percent in 2018.

COMEX silver futures were down 12 percent at $15.54 an ounce in 2018, the biggest yearly decline since 2014.

May's cabinet will meet next week for more ""no-deal Brexit"" planning in case the British parliament fails to approve a draft deal London and Brussels have reached after nearly two years of talks.

The plan is deeply unpopular in London and May was forced to abort a December debate about the arrangement after admitting it faced heavy defeat. A new vote in the House of Commons is scheduled for the week starting on January 14.

But the cabinet's bid to show it was ready for anything was set back when the BBC discovered the ferry contract awarded to a firm without any actual vessels in place.

Britain reached three commercial agreements to move cargo should the main cross-Channel sea route grind to a halt after Brexit takes place on March 29.

Britain's transport department did not explain why Seaborne was handed the 13.8 million pounds (USD 17.7 million, 15.4 million euro) deal.

""This contract was awarded in the full knowledge that Seaborne Freight is a new shipping provider, and that the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services,"" the ministry said in a statement released to AFP.

""As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company's commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award."" But a local councillor said it seemed unlikely that Seaborne could have everything set up in time.

""Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them 14 million pounds?"" councillor Paul Messenger asked. ""I don't understand the logic of that.""

May's critics in the Labour main opposition party also pounced.

""Nothing could sum Brexit up better than the utter stench of this latest (transport department) mess. Reeks,"" said Labour MP Neil Coyle.

The BBC said the narrow berths at Ramsgate port in southeast England made them unsuitable for most existing commercial ships.

The port has not been used commercially since 2013. Seaborne said in a statement that it has spent two years working on plans to get Ramsgate up and running by early 2019.

""It was intended to start the service in mid-February but this has now been delayed until late March for operational reasons,"" Seaborne said.

All-rounder Darren Sammy, who captained West Indies when Pybus was director of cricket, expressed disbelief at his return.

""Lies lies lies... Must be fake news,"" Sammy tweeted, and a day later, in response to a reply said, ""Well I am still hoping that nightmare is not true #fakenews he is not coming back at CWI.""

Pybus' term as director of cricket was controversial in the Caribbean cricket system as it was he who drafted the policy that made participation in West Indies' domestic competitions mandatory for international selection across formats. This resulted in a number of senior players choosing to focus solely on playing T20 leagues around the world.

A BJP legislator in Bihar allegedly having close links with outlawed Maoists is facing their wrath as he reportedly failed to return Rs 5 crore he was given by the Maoists to exchange banned currency notes after demonetisation in 2016, the police said on Monday.

A day after Maoists shot dead the uncle of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator Rajan Singh, and set a house and 10 vehicles on fire in the state's Aurangabad district, some posters left behind by the ultra-left wing extremists were found.

The posters said that their attack was to teach Singh a ""hard lesson"" for betrayal with them for not exchanging the banned notes of Rs 5 crore that they gave him in good faith after demonetisation but he never returned.

Aurangabad Superintendent of Police Satya Prakash said BJP Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Rajan Singh was the main target of Maoist attack at his house in Sudi Bigaha village but he was not there at that time.

""Maoists in their posters claimed that they gave Rs 5 crore to the BJP legislator to exchange banned currency notes after demonetisation, but he has neither exchanged nor returned the money.""

The police did not rule out the alleged link between the BJP legislator and Maoists.

However, the legislator refuted Maoists allegations and said he has no connection with the Maoists. It was all baseless allegations, he said, adding: ""I have nothing to do with Maoists.""

Hours after Maoists attacked his house to eliminate him, Rajan Singh said the police and the state government were responsible for the attack.

""The Maoist attack in the village is the result of mistakes of both the administration and the state government,"" he said.

""I had given an application to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and the DGP for setting up a police station or at least a police outpost in the village, but no action has been taken. The administration and the state government are responsible for the incident,"" Singh said.

However, district police officials told IANS that contractor-turned-politician BJP legislator Rajan Singh is on the hit list of Maoists for huge levy that he did not pay. ""The BJP legislator has been running contract works in the Maoist stronghold of Aurangabad. He can't work without his closeness with Maoists.""

Holding a retaliatory media briefing, he pointed out that the CM has never spoken to the media on issues like Bhima-Koregaon, Hindutva leaders Sambhaji Bhide 'Guruji', Milind Ekbote or the Sanatan Sanstha bomb production factory.

""His press conference today (Monday) on AgustaWestland deal is that of a thief complaining about a robbery. Why doesn't he speak out against the Rafale fighter jets deal? This is a programme started by the BJP to make fake allegations and defame the Congress through press conferences with an eye on the upcoming elections,"" he said.

Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government of hiding behind James Christian Michel to cover its own corruption and scams, Chavan demandd to know why Prime Minister Narendra Modi lift the Congress government's blacklisting of the AgustaWestland company and even allowed them to participate in the Make In India initiative.

He cited records of the deal right from the contract process in February 2010 for procuring 12 VVIP helicopters worth around Rs 3,546 crore from AgustaWestland and its parent company Finmeccanica, but after media reports, the then UPA Government ordered a CBI probe into the deal in February 2013.

Against the Rs 1,620 given in August, the government recovered a total of Rs 2,054 crore, though a year before in February 2013, the UPA had started the process to blacklist the company and in July 2014 and initiated the probe into the deal before cancelling the contract.

""However, in August 22, 2014, the BJP Government lifted the ban on AugustaWestland and Finmeccanica, in August 2015, they participated in the 'Make In India' through 'Aero India 2015', in October the government permitted a joint venture with Indian Rotorcraft Ltd to manufacture AW-199 military helicopters in India through AgustaWestland and Tata through the FIPB, and in 2017, another 100 naval choppers were included in the purchase process,"" said Chavan.

He sought to know why the Modi government shows such favours on blacklisted companies and said it lost all the cases against AgustaWestland in Italy, and the High Court of Milan said there was no corruption by Indian officials in the deal, but even there the present government did not appeal and lost.

""The false story of Michel was written by the Modi government and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in July 2018 to hide their corruption and scams. In July 2018, Michel's lawyer and others had given interviews on the government and ED's offers to them if they named Congress leaders. This is part of a planned conspiracy in which the government is playing dirty defamatory politics using Michel,"" Chavan said.

He also posed six questions on the deal and said the Sahara diary has named BJP leaders which should be investigated before seeking explanations from the Congress.

""The government and the BJP are misusing agencies to manufacture lies. I am surprised to know that the present government is spreading lies...is trying to manufacture something out of nothing,"" he told reporters here.

While the opposition party alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government were AgustaWestland's protectors and promoters, the saffron party accused it of defending Christian Michel, an alleged middleman in the deal, and asked why was it scared of a probe into the case.

Antony said it was the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government that had ordered a CBI inquiry the moment it had come to know of the corruption allegations in the VVIP AgustaWestland helicopter deal and initiated the proceedings to blacklist the company.

He claimed that the UPA government fought the case ""unusually"" in a Milan court against the chopper-manufacturing company and won it too.

""We cancelled the contract and started the proceedings of blacklisting. But after we left, the Modi government did nothing against AgustaWestland. Instead of acting against the company, they favoured the company,"" Antony said.

He added that if the Congress had anything to hide, it would not have ordered a CBI probe into the AgustaWestland deal or gone to Italy to fight the case.

The senior Congress leader alleged that the government and the BJP were trying to divert attention from the allegations raised by his party on the Rafale fighter jets deal and not ordering an inquiry or a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) probe into the charges.

""During our time, whenever there were allegations, even in media reports, we took action and held an inquiry,"" Antony said.

On the BJP's charges of the Congress being jittery ever since Michel was extradited to India, the chief spokesperson of the opposition party, Randeep Surjewala, said this was like ""chor machaye shor"" (the thief making noise).

Antony said in this case, AgustaWestland was selected after a first technical evaluation by a team of officials and a detailed field evaluation by a team comprising Air Force, Special Protection Group (SPG) and defence ministry officials.

""They had selected AgustaWestland out of these two companies which were suited and eligible. So, the Field Evaluation Committee had recommended AgustaWestland. It was not a political issue. It was purely an official decision, based on recommendations by a team consisting of Air Force, SPG and defence ministry officials,"" he said.

On whether the BJP government renewed its attacks on the Congress leadership to counter the alleged Rafale scam, the former defence minister said, ""There is a possibility, because even now, the present government is not able to answer many of the questions we posed.

""I posed five questions, they did not answer those. We posed many questions and the entire Opposition is demanding a JPC on Rafale in a House in which they have got a majority. Their chairman will be there. So, they are panicking. May be they want to divert attention.""

""This helicopter is not for military operation. It is for VVIP movement, for the president, vice-president and the prime minister. It was cancelled in 2014. After that, the present government also has not taken any step to procure another helicopter. Instead, during our time and the NDA's time also, for VVIP usage, the government is using the Russian MI-18 upgraded helicopters. It has nothing to do with operational preparedness, it is VVIP movement. That is going on smoothly from about 2014 till today with Russian Helicopters.

In a first for a bankruptcy firm, nearly 200 employees of debt-ridden RTIL -- formerly Reid & Taylor (India) -- have formed an association to scout for potential investors and revive the company. More importantly, the move is to prevent liquidation of the firm, with no major investors evincing interest.

Further, the employees who are based out of the company's Mysuru facility will move the National Company Law Tribunal's (NCLT) Mumbai bench seeking to add the association as ""co-applicants"" in the suit. The body, an Association of Persons (AOP), will file its plea before the NCLT on January 1 (Tuesday).

""We have been hearing that there are no takers for the resolution plan and the company might be heading for liquidation.

Further, the AOP (according to the Income Tax Act, 1961, it is an integration of two or more persons for a common purpose) is also promising to bring in investors.

""Already two investors have evinced interest in investing in RTIL, with one of them agreeing to submit a detailed resolution plan, including the investments they intend to make with the AOP soon,"" he said, but did not disclose their names, citing confidentiality clauses.

The investors need to go through the documents before they can submit a final bid, he added.

The association would also interact with the management, apart from sorting out issues relating to the staff members.

RTIL, a vertically-integrated premium clothing provider that sells under the international brand 'Reid & Taylor' in India, is struggling to pay off its ₹3,800-crore debt.

It still runs a factory with about 30-40 per cent production capacity in Mysuru, and employs about 1,200 personnel and another 200-250 contract labourers. It also has about 1,000-1,500 dealers across the country.

In June 2018, the Interim Resolution Professional of RTIL called for an Expression of Interest from prospective lenders seeking a resolution plan in accordance with the provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).

The basic criteria to submit a resolution plan is a minimum consolidated net worth of ₹50 crore at group level as of March 31, 2017.

Sebi Monday issued a framework for making physical settlement of stock derivatives mandatory in a phased manner, a move that could bring much-needed balance between equity cash and derivative segments.

Stock derivatives, which are currently being cash-settled, would move to physical settlement in a prescribed manner, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) said in a circular.

According to the regulator, stocks that are being cash-settled shall be ranked in descending order based on daily market capitalisation averaged for December 2018.

Based on the ranking arrived, the bottom 50 stocks would move to physical settlement from April 2019 expiry onwards, the next 50 stocks from the bottom would move to physical settlement from July 2019 expiry onwards, and the remaining stocks would move to physical settlement from October 2019 expiry onwards, it added.

Sebi said derivatives introduced on new stocks, meeting the enhanced eligibility criteria specified by the regulator, would also be physically settled.

Derivatives in financial markets typically refer to a forward, future, option or any other hybrid contract of pre- determined fixed duration, linked for the purpose of contract fulfilment to the value of a specified real or financial asset or to an index of securities.

Broadly, there are two types of derivative contracts -- futures and options. A futures contract means a legally binding agreement to buy or sell the underlying security on a future date, while options contract gives the buyer or holder of the contract the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price within or at the end of a specified period.

Earlier in April, the markets regulator had decided that physical settlement will be made mandatory for all stock derivatives.

In September, Sebi had issued a consultation paper asking market participants to submit their views on whether physical settlement should be done in a phased manner starting with stock options followed by stock futures.

Addressing a hurriedly-convened press conference here, Adityanath claimed the Rs 3,700 crore AugustaWestland deal during the UPA regime involved a bribery of around Rs 360 crore, out of which the Congress leaders got Rs 150 crore.

However, he did not elaborate on his claims.

The ruling BJP has stepped up its attack on the main opposition party and its leaders in the wake of the alleged reference made by Christian Michel, the alleged middleman in the AgustaWestland deal, about one ""Mrs Gandhi"", as told by the Enforcement Directorate to a court.

The Congress has, however, rejected the allegations and has counter-alleged that it was the Modi government that was a ""protector, benefactor and promoter"" of AgustaWestland as it lifted a ban imposed on the helicopter maker during the UPA rule and allowed it to bid for 100 naval utility helicopters.

The Congress has also said it will get the matter probed if it comes back to power in 2019.

Address a press conference in the national capital, former defence minister and senior Congress leader A K Antony Monday accused the BJP and the government of ""manufacturing"" lies in the AgustaWestland case and said Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi never interfered in any defence deals during the UPA regime.

At his press conference, Adityanath alleged the Congress did not leave any sector between 2004 and 2014 where it did not commit a scam, ""be it jal (water), thal (earth), nabh (sky), antariksh (space) and pataal (underground).""

""In this context, Christian Michel taking the name of 'Mrs Gandhi' proves that Congress is fully involved in this (scam),"" he said.

The UP chief minister said officials of AugustaWestland have already been punished by an Italian court.

""The court had also said that other accused persons linked to the case are residing out of Italy, and hence it cannot do anything. After all, who are are those people. The surfacing of Mrs Gandhi's name itself proves the involvement of Congress leaders,"" he claimed.

""This is the reason as to why the Congress is nervous,"" Adityanath said, while alleging that the party has been committing scams in the name of defence deals but it has got ""unmasked"" in the AugustaWestland case.

He further alleged that the country's defence needs would not have got impacted if the Congress did not indulge in bribery in defence deals.

""Congress president Rahul Gandhi must apologise before the country. The truth is emerging before the people and they will punish the Congress,"" Adityanath said.

2018 was a year of many firsts and records in Indian sport. While MC Mary Kom went on to win her sixth world title on home soil, teenagers like Sourabh Choudhary, Manu Bhaker, Anish Bhanwala and others took the shooting world by storm, winning medals at the Commonwealth and Asian Games and also at the ISSF World Cups.

On the cricket field, the Virat Kohli-led Indian side is on the brink of registering their first series win in Australia and the rise of Hima Das on the athletic track has made the world stand up and take notice of the talent that stormed to a World Under-20 Championship gold in what was her first full year on the international circuit.

Not to forget the exploits of Neeraj Chopra in Javelin Throw, success of Bajrang Punia and Vinesh Phogat on the wrestling mat and the consistent performances of PV Sindhu which culminated in her winning the BWF World Tour Finals to sign off the year in style.

And the success of the Indian Table Tennis contingent at the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games. While India has been winning medals at the Commonwealth Games, the two bronze medals in Jakarta was one of the biggest success stories in Indian sports given the level of competition.

But none of the successes in sports come overnight and the seeds of the results -- positive or negative -- are always sown in the decisions or incidents that take place in the past.

For example, the rise of Das can be trailed back to two coaches in Assam identifying the raw talent of a girl in the local meets and India's sprint coach Galina Bukharina making her shift from the 100 and 200 metre events to the 400 after she joined the national camp.

Similarly, the seeds of success for the Indian teenage shooters were sown about three years back when the National Rifle Association of India launched its junior program under Indian coaches Jaspal Rana and Deepali Deshpande and their efforts finally bore fruit in 2018.

Here is a look at a few decisions or incidents which could shape the direction Indian sports could take in the coming years.

Opinions are clearly divided on the need for the Khelo India School Games (KISG) given that the School Games Federation of India (SGFI) and the National Sports Federations have been conducting age group events for years now to identify and nurture talent. The idea behind KISG stems from the Gujarat Government's Khel Mahakumbh experiment which over the years has managed to broaden the base of children taking up sport and nurturing sporting culture in the state.

The KISG, however, did not follow that model in the strictest sense and made it an event for elite athletes, raising questions about whether spending crores of rupees on yet another inter-school tournament was worth it.

The implementation and approach towards the program can be debated at length but there is no doubt that this is high time, the focus of Indian sports ministry and all stake holders shifted towards grassroot sports and nurturing talent from schools and junior colleges.

This year over 1500 students were selected under the talent identification scheme for support with almost two dozen academies identified for training of these selected athletes. The government also plans to support a few universities to create sports infrastructure in the coming years and hopefully build a robust school and college sports program that can consistently produce talent.

Ask any yesteryear's sports star about their journey to the top and they would credit the Inter-University tournaments as their stomping ground. But over the years, the All India Universities -- the parent body to conduct Inter University tournaments -- has been in doldrums and the haphazard ways in which the SGFI and AIU have been conducting their meets, the structure definitely needs a overhaul.

One can only hope that KISG evolves over the years and actually contributes to talent development and nurturing sports culture at the school or college level, failing which a lot of money would just go down the drain.

One of the major criticism about the National Sports Federations have been their reluctance to turn professional and over-dependence on the sports ministry for funding. There is a long way to go for this to change and sports federations to be self sufficient, but the NRAI and Wrestling Federation of India have shown the way with their strategic partnerships.

The Wrestling Federation has signed a long term deal with the Tata group while the JSW Group has pledged support to the shooting federation till the 2024 Paris Olympics.

The direct financial support in these deals may not be exponential but the Wrestling Federation has already introduced a Central Contract system on the lines of the Indian Cricket Board while the shooting federation plans to utilise the money to pay the Indian coaches better remuneration, a move that they believe can help end India's dependency on foreign experts in the next few years.

The Wrestling Federation which has been struggling to convince the Sports Ministry about the need for hiring foreign coaches for over a year now, has decided to hire a few experts on their own thanks to the support from their corporate partners and the players believe that such a move could actually give them and the federation more freedom to choose coaches and support staff of their choice.

In all the muddle created by infighting between two Committee of Administrators appointed to implement the Lodha Committee reforms, the fact that BCCI's new constitution has been made and cleared by the Supreme Court has been lost. According to the time line submitted by the CoA to the court, elections under the new constitution have to be held by March 2019 and though many state associations are resisting the change, they will sooner or later have to fall in line and implement the reforms if not in toto.

A similar exercise was undertaken in the Archery Association of India where Administrator S Y Quraishi conducted elections under the new constitution which he has drafted. The new constitution debars public servants from being part of the federation and gives a lot more representation to players.

The Indian Olympic Association and even the federation has decided to oppose the new constitution but if the Court puts its weight behind Quraishi's draft, then it could change the face of Indian sports administration.

There are many in other federations who are waiting with baited breath to move the courts seeking change and over throw the incumbents, who have run the federations as their fiefdom for decades.

The popular theme in all these proposed reforms is a bigger role for former players in administration. The argument that players are best placed to run sports federations efficiently is flawed given the fact that administration is a completely different ball game and not all players are competent enough to handle the job.

Most of them who are currently in administration have little or no formal education in administration and are basically functioning at the whims and fancies of their political masters or are merely surviving on their stature as elite sportspersons.

Internationally, many sports federations are run by former athletes but almost all of them have gone back to academics at the end of their playing careers to complete management degrees and rise through the ranks. May be, the amended constitutions will inspire more sports persons in India to take that route.

Age fraud has been an open secret in Indian sports but most federation would prefer to bury their head in the sand and pretend that the problem doesn't exist rather than take the bull by the horns and curb the menace.

Thanks to the sports ministry forcing their hand a few years ago, most of these federations have taken a few cosmetics steps like conducting random age verification tests but the results of which are hardly made public and the federations avoid taking any action against those found over age, hiding behind the argument that the results of the medical tests are not 100% correct.

But the social media outrage over Gourav Mukhi becoming the ""youngest goalscorer"" in the Indian Super League at 16 and the cognisance taken by the international media and hopefully by the international federations should be enough to wake the federations up from their slumber.

Over the last few years, as India has started performing on the international stage in age group tournaments, the chatter around the over age menace has been on the rise even internationally and the Mukhi controversy should be an indicator that in the age of social media and legally aware parents, they can't just ignore the problem.

If the Mukhi case actually leads to a proper system of investigating age fraud and curbing the menace, Indian sports would be indebted to the Jamshedpur FC striker, who is difficult to miss with his trademark moustache that belies his registered age with the AIFF.

The Indian anti-doping program came under scrutiny when the World Anti-Doping Agency decided to pick a considerable chunk of samples that were reported ""negative"" by the National Dope Testing Laboratory and over half a dozen of them came positive in retesting, including those of quartermile Nirmala Sheoran, middle distance runner Sanjivani Jadhav and others.

While the world body has the right to ask for any sample for retesting, what has surprised many is the number of samples WADA took for re-testing to their Montreal lab, clearly indicating lack of faith in the methods employed by the Indian lab.

There is a growing feeling that the National Anti Doping Agency has been far more lenient on top athletes in the past few years as they want to prove that doping incidents have reduced in India and a RTI by the Indian Express shows how the agency hardly tested the big names in the run up to the Asian Games.

But with WADA watching, NDTL runs the risk of losing its accreditation if it doesn't get its house in order. Hopefully that would be a good enough incentive for NADA to get the anti-doping program back on track and for the federations and Sports Authority of India to educate the medical staff attached with the teams on how to tackle the menace."

The newly opened store in Mumbai offers the brand's exclusive collection of engineered wood products such as EvoLlae - thin 3.5mm sheets, EvoLumber - ready to use processed lumber and EvoBoards - the finger jointed boards.

While sharing experience Mr. Avijit Marwah, Director, EvoWood said, ""In today's day and age, every industry is undergoing major developments and innovations, but unfortunately, woodworking has not witnessed the kind of change that is possible, especially considering the fact that it is one of the longest standing building material in existence. The creativity and versatility that wood provides are enormous but at the same time woodworking requires a lot of skill and knowledge.""

Avijit Marwah listed down 6 tips to look out for while opting for wooden interiors

Wood is the most commonly used material when it comes to furniture and the reason behind its success is its durability and its allurement. Wood is available in various species and being such a versatile material, it can upgrade and enhance the overall living experience. There's a reason why people always go for wooden interiors, the warmth and cosines it brings to any space naturally gravitates humans towards it.

Choosing the right species of wood - Wood has the tendency to contract and expand in different weather conditions and is also considered as a living material. Like the human body, wood adapts to different weather and climatic conditions so it's important to choose the right species of the wood as each wood species has its unique properties, durability factors and the tendency to react to different weather conditions.

Stained woods in different colors - While opting for wood the only thing that comes to mind is the classic brown tone as most of the wooden species come in such color tones. However, now one can opt for either the classical tones or even go for various different colored stained woods according to the theme and color tones of the space. Thus, people can always go for colors that they think is best for the overall look of their homes, offices etc.

Regular Repolishing - We apply a coat of zinc to the iron so that it doesn't rust and lose its color. Similarly, it is equally important to always frequently polish the wood so that it doesn't lose its charm and its unique properties. Polishing wood from time to time will not only keep the wood safe from parasites but it will help to maintain the shine and the quality of the wood.

Avoid chemicals and harsh detergents - It is always advised to not use any detergent or any cleansing solution to the wood as it will destroy and harm the quality of the wood. These detergents can cost wood to lose its colours and pattern which will impact the overall look of the interior of the structural applications and wood is the material which reacts to these harsh chemicals.

Right knowledge of wooden species - Wood is available in numerous species and each wood reacts differently in various climatic conditions. One should ensure that the wood is of correct quality and seasoned wood is used for all the interior applications to increase its longevity. Hence, one should have the right knowledge of the wood which needs to be used for the interiors.

Thorough research and the right budget - Before coming up with different ideas and concept for interiors one should always do thorough research work on various design and interior portals and make a budget accordingly. Wood comes like many other materials, wood has a wide variety in pricing so one must understand what suits them best whether its the price or maintenance.

This was a year for consolidating the gains that have accrued from major policy decisions taken in the previous four years, a time for monitoring of ongoing projects, tackling road blocks and adding to the already impressive pace of work achieved last year. The Ministry took a decision to complete all ongoing projects that had been awarded upto 2015-16, and placed the highest ever target of constructing at least 12,000 kms of national highways as against 9829 kms achieved during 2017-18, and make special efforts to take this length to 16000 km. Overall, more than about 61,300 km length of road projects, costing more than Rs. 6.48 lakh crore, are in progress at present. The balance ongoing works (which have been awarded, appointed dates declared and works going on at sites) are more than 30,200 kms during the year. In the first nine months of FY 2018-19, 5,759 km has been completed in 18-19 against 4,942 km up to same period in last year.

1.2 In order to achieve this target the Ministry brought in policies, guidelines and practices for expediting pre-construction activities and bringing in more efficiency and transparency in the process. The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS)was developed to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC Mode. BhoomiRashi portal is being used extensively for expediting the process of notification for land acquisition. The portal BIMS and BhoomiRashi portals have further been linked with Public Financial Management System(PFMS) to facilitate real time payment to beneficiaries.

1.3 On the finance front too, National Highways Authority of India did a successful financial closure of its first project under Toll- Operate -Transfer this year andoffered 586 km of national highways under the second bundle. The first TOT bundle of 9 projects, totaling approximately 681 KM of roads in two states of Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat, was awarded earlier during the year for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the Authority's estimate. National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also got an unsecured loan of Rs 25,000 crore from State Bank of India for 10 years with 3 years of moratorium on repayments. This is the largest amount of loan to have been sanctioned to NHAI in one stroke by any institution. This is also the largest long term unsecured loan sanctioned by SBI at a time to any entity.

A two days long exercise was conducted to review of over 700 ongoing National Highway projects in the country, and over 300 projects were identified to be completed by 2019 achieving the highest ever construction in financial year 2018-19.

The table below details the trends of NH construction over the years.

This is the umbrella program for the highways sector unrolled in 2017-18, that aims to optimize the efficiency of road traffic movement across the country by bridging critical infrastructure gaps. 34,800 km of National Highways are to be constructed under the Phase-I of the programme between 2017-18 to 2021-22 in a phased manner at a cost of Rs. 5,35,000 crore. This includes 5,000 kms of the National Corridors, 9000 kms of Economic Corridors, 6000 km of Feeder Corridors and Inter-Corridors, 2000 kms of Border Roads, 2,000 kms of Coastal Roads and Port Connectivity Roads and 800 kms of Green-field Expressways.

Projects for 6,407 km road length have been awarded under the BharatmalaPariyojana(including residual NHDP) till the end of October this year. DPRs are being prepared for projects for the balance length. De- congestion projects have been completed for 13 out of 191 congestion points identified, and are under progress for de-congestion of 80 other points. In addition, DPRs are being prepared for 93 congestion points.Out of the 35 locations identified for Multimodal Logistics Parks, DPRs have been initiated for 7 locations and availability of land parcels is being confirmed with State Governments for the rest of the locations.

In order to ensure safe and smooth flow of traffic, Ministry has envisaged a plan for replacement of Level Crossings on National Highways by ROBs/ RUBs under a scheme known as SetuBharatam. Under this programme, out of 174 ROBs/RUBs which are to be constructed, 91 have been sanctioned with an estimated cost of Rs.7,104.72 crore. Out of 91 sanctioned, 59 ROBs/RUBs have been awarded which are in various stages of progress.

The project envisages development of easy access to the four prominent Dhams, namely, Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedranath and Badrinath, situated in the state of Uttrakhand. These four Dhams are prominent pilgrimage centres. The project entails development of 889 km of roads with configuration of two-lane with paved shoulders at an estimated cost of about Rs. 12,000 crore. The projects are being taken up on EPC mode and the programme is targeted for completion by March, 2020.

The two projects of Peripheral Expressways around Delhi, comprising 135 km Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE), and 135 km Western Peripheral Expressway (WPE) connecting NH-1 and NH-2 from Western and Eastern side of Delhi was completed this year and inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May 2018 and November 2018 respectively. The EPE was constructed by NHAI and WPE by Haryana Government. The two expressways were envisaged with the twin objectives of decongesting and de-polluting the national capital by diverting the traffic not destined for Delhi.

The EPE stretches from Kundli on NH 1 to Palwal on NH 2, and was constructed at a cost ofRs. 4617.87 crore, in addition to Rs. 5900crorewere spent on acquiring 1700 acres of land. It was completed in a record time of about 500 days against the scheduled target of 910 days. It is a fully access-controlled six-lane expressway with a closed tolling system. The expressway has an iconic toll plaza equipped with electronic toll collection infrastructure, ITS control system of the entire EPE and a digital art gallery, with holographic models of major structures and making of the EPE. Weigh-in-Motion equipment at all 30 entry points, solar power on the entire length, eight solar power plants with a capacity of 4000 KW, rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation and 36 replicas of monuments depicting Indian culture and heritage are major features of this expressway. This project has generated employment opportunities of about 50 lakh man-days.

The 8.36 km long Package -1 of the projects was inaugurated by Hon'ble Prime Minister in May this year. It is a 14 lane, access-controlledsection stretching from Nizammudin Bridge to Delhi UP Border, and was completed in a record time of 18 months as against the earlier expected construction period of 30 months, at a cost of about Rs. 841.50 crore. This is the first National Highway in the country with 14 lanes, and has several features that would help reduce pollution. These include a 2.5-metre-wide cycle track on either side of the highway, a vertical garden on the Yamuna Bridge, solar lighting system and watering of plants through drip irrigation only.

Package II from UP Border to Dasna(19.28 km), Package -III - Dasna to Hapur( 22.27) km and Package -IV - Green-field Alignment from Dasna to Meerut -(31.78 km) are under construction and are likely to be completed by March 2019.

The 473 km expressway will link Ahmedabad-Vadodara Expressway to Mumbai-Pune Expressway thus providing Expressway connectivity from Ahmedabad to Pune for a length of about 650 Km.

This 1250 km Expressway is being developed along a new alignment between Delhi and Mumbai, which passes through backward and tribal districts of Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat. A sum of one lakh crore rupees will be spent on this expressway.It will reduce the distance between Delhi and Mumbai from the present 1450km through NH 8 to 1250 km, and the travel time to 12 hours. The sections of proposed highway from Delhi to Dahod in Rajasthan are under tendering, while the section between Vadodara to Ankleshwar in Gujarat have already been awarded. The DPR is under progress for the remaining sections.

DPR is under progress for this 260 km Expressway. This is a green-field alignment. There are two existing roads connecting Bangalore-Chennai, one is via Hoskote (Bangalore)-AP then to Chennai & second is via Electronic City (Bangalore) Hosur(Tamil Nadu) and then to Chennai. The alignment of the proposed expressway is passing in between these two stretches.

Greenfield alignment is being explored for this 500 km long proposed Expressway.

DPR has been awarded and alignment finalization is under progress for the new green-field 940 km Nagpur - Hyderabad - Bangalore EXP.

DPR is in progress for 75 km of Kanpur - Lucknow EXP

Hon'ble Prime Minister inaugurated the 16.55 km, Rs 759.36 crore Varanasi Ring Road Phase-I and 17.25 km, Rs 812.59 crore Babatput-Varanasi road on NH-56 in November. It has reduced the travel time from Varanasi to the airport, and is proving a big relief to the people of Varanasi and to tourists providing a more convenient access to Sarnath, an important site for Buddhist pilgrimage.

The Ministry has taken up construction of a signature 4-lane Bridge to connect the mainland at Okha to Byet-Dwarka Island off the Gujarat Coast with this SignatureBridge spanning a length of 2.32 kms. The Project has been awarded on 01.01.2018 at a cost of Rs. 689.47 crores. This will be the longest span cable stayed bridge in India with the main span of 500 mtrs. The project is scheduled to be completed in a period of 30 months.

Approval has been given for a project for construction of 9.9 km long new 6 - lane bridge across river Ganga on NH - 96 at Phaphamau in Allahabad with total capital cost of Rs. 1948.25 crore. The construction period for the project is three years and likely to be completed by December, 2021. The new bridge will resolve the traffic congestion on existing old 2 - lane Phaphamau bridge on NH-96 at Allahabad. The new bridge will also facilitate to the large congregation of people at Holy City Allahabad during Kumbh, Ardh-Kumbh and other yearly ritual baths at SANGAM in Prayag. This will give a boost to pilgrimage tourism and local economy of Holy city of Prayag. This new 6 - lane bridge will also be beneficial for the Lucknow / Faizabad bound traffic coming from Madhya Pradesh via National Highway - 27 and National Highway - 76 through Naini Bridge. In addition, this project of new bridge will generate direct employment during construction for about 9.20 lakh mandays.

Approval was given to a project for construction of 6.930 km long 4-lane bridge at Phulaut in Bihar, along with approval for rehabilitation and up-gradation of existing Birpur- Bihpur section of National Highway-106. The construction of this new Bridge will fill the existing 30 km long gap between Udakishanganj and Bihpur of National Highway Number 106 in Bihar, which will provide through connectivity between Nepal/ North Bihar/ East-West Corridor (passing through NH- 57) and South Bihar/ Jharkhand/ Golden Quadrilateral (passing through NH -2), besides full utilization of National Highway Number-31.

A network of 35 Multimodal Logistics Parks had been identified for development in the Phase - 1 of BharatmalaPariyojana. The availability of the land parcels for development of Multimodal Logistics Parks has been confirmed at 7 locations and DPRs have been initiated in all the nodes.

This is a project for constructing a 14.150 km long, 2-lane bi-directional Zojila Tunnel in Jammu & Kashmir. This would be India's longest road tunnel and the longest bi-directional tunnel in Asia. The construction of this tunnel will provide all weather connectivity between Srinagar, Kargil and Leh and will bring about all round economic and socio-cultural integration of these regions.

The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) approved the construction, operation and maintenance of the 2- Lane, 4.532 Km long Bi-directional Silkyara Bend - Barkot Tunnel on Dharasu-Yamunotri section along NH -134 in the State of Uttarakhand. The project forms part of the Chardham Plan. The construction period of the project is 4 years at an estimated cost of Rs. 1383.78 crore. Once complete, this stretch will reduce the travel distance from Dharasu to Yamunotri by about 20 Km and travel time byaboutanhour.It will also provide all weather connectivity to Yamunotri, encouraging regional socio-economic development, trade and tourism within the country. The project will be implemented by National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd. (NHIDCL).

Around Rs. 1,90,000 crore worth of projects have been sanctioned for the construction of road projects for over 12,000 km in the North East region. The projects being executed by NHIDCL are to the tune of Rs. 1, 66,026 crore, covering 10,892 km of roads in all the eight NE states. Projects costing Rs. 17,257 crore have been allotted to the respective state PWDs. Further, projects costing Rs. 7,000 crore are entrusted to the NHAI.

The Ministry has focused on completion of on-going projects along with sanction and award of new projects. A total of 73 projects (8,187 km) worth an estimated investment of Rs.1,00,000 crore wereidentified as Languishing Projects. The reasons for delay were identified and policy interventions undertaken to address the same.

The Ministry is monetizing its road assets constructed with public funds through Toll-Operate-Transfer (ToT) scheme. The scheme envisages bidding of bundled national highways for a concession period of 30 years. The first bundle comprised 9 projects, totalling 681 km of roads in Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat. It was awarded in 2018 to Macquarie for Rs. 9,681 Crore, which was 1.5 times the NHAI's estimate.The second bundle comprises over 586 kms spread over four states - Rajasthan, Gujarat, West Bengal and Bihar. The offer has 12 toll plazas across four highways.

TheNational Highways Authority of India (NHAI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding(MoU)withtheStateBankofIndiatoreceiveRs.25,000croreasa long-term,unsecuredloanfor10years.Thisisthelargestamountofloantohavebeen sanctioned by the SBl in one go. This is also the largest ever fund that NHAI has ever received in one go.

The Ministry has issued detailed guidelines for determination of proper alignment of NH projects, advising executing agencies to examine the feasibility of a green- field alignment, especially in the case of economic corridors, instead of widening existing highways. This has been done because widening involves acquisition of land for Right of Way (RoW), shifting of utilities and demolition of built up structure, all of which involves a lot of time and cost. Also, earlier highways were largely planned to be serpentine, linking all possible towns in the vicinity. This road geometry has been found to be sub optimal, especially in case of economic corridors. BharatmalaPariyojanaalso calls for a corridor approach for economic corridors. It has also been found in a few test cases that it is feasible to acquire a RoW of 60 to 70 mtrs for a green field road project at the same cost as involved in the expansion of an existing road, especially when the associated costs and time taken in utility shifting, tree felling, additional compensation for demolition of structures coming in the RoW under expansion are taken into account.

AWebUtilityhasbeendevelopedwherebythelandacquisitionprocedureforthe NH projects, including processing of all LA related gazette notifications, are being done through a common platform called ""BhoomiRashi"". The Utility has been linked with the e-gazette platform of the MinistryofUrbanDevelopment,GovernmentofIndia,forpublicationofGazette Notifications.TheuseofBhumi Rashi has helped in cutting down the processing time from 2 to 3 months earlier to one to two weeksnow.

BhoomiRashi has also been integrated with the Public Financial Management System(PFMS)platformoftheMinistryofFinancefordepositofcompensationin theaccountsoflandowners/interestedpersonsonarealtimebasis, instead of being parked with CALA.

The Ministry has developed a Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) to streamline the process of pre-qualification of bidders for contracts on EPC mode for all NH works and centrally sponsored works.BIMS acts as a data base for allbasic details of bidders like civil works experience, cash accruals and network, annual turnover etc,. This allows quick pre-qualification assessment of bidders based on evaluation parameters like threshold capacity and bid capacity from already stored data. Technical evaluationcantherefore be carried out faster using this information.

AnnualawardsforexcellenceinNationalHighwayssectorhasbeeninstitutedfrom thisyearonwardsforrecognizingconcessionairesandcontractorswhohavebeen performing exceptionally well. Applications have been invited from all the concessionaires and contractors working in the field of highways construction and tolling. These awards are designed across the fivecategories of construction management, operation and maintenance, best toll plaza, safest highway, innovation in design and construction technology.

India's first Highway Capacity Manual developed by CSIR-CRRI was launched this year. The manual is designed to be a tool for guiding road engineers and policy makers in the country. It lays down guidelines for the development and management of different types of roads, based on traffic characteristics on such roads having varying lane configurations.

The Ministry has organized a workshop on 18.12.2018 in Delhi for Regional Officers of Ministry, NHAI and NHIDCL to discuss the issues relating to land acquisition, contract document (EPC/DPR) and E-Disha (ERP projects), new standards and technical specifications. A Manual of Guidelines on Land Acquisition for National Highways under the National Highways Act, 1956 has also been released for seamless process of Land Acquisition for National Highways.

As per the Ministry's annual report on road accidents based on the data reported by Police authorities throughout India, there has been some marginal reduction in the number of road accidents and fatalities in 2017, as can be seen from the table below.

The Ministry has been making concerted efforts to address the problem of road safety through a series of measures that include improving road infrastructure, road safety audits, identification and rectification of black spots on roads and strengthening the automobile safety standards, organizing road safety awareness programmes and strengthening enforcement etc. These efforts have started showing some results.

The Ministry has so far identified 789 road accident black spots in various States of which 651 ON National Highways and 138 are on State roads. Work for rectification of these black spots is at various stages of completion.

The Ministry has been working in association with States, Vehicle manufactures and NGOs for strengthening the driving training. Institute of Driving training and Research (IDTRs), Regional Driving Training Centres (RDTCs) and Driving Training Centre (DTC) have been established which act as model Driving Training Centres with state of art infrastructure. Ministry has also launched a scheme for creating driving training centres in all the districts of the country and support refresher-training programme for heavy commercial vehicles drivers. The Ministry is implementing a scheme for setting up of Model Institute of Drivers Training and Research (IDTR) by States/UTs. So far 24 (nos.) ITDRs have been sanctioned in different States/UTs and bout 16 are complete and functioning.

The Ministry has issued guidelines associating Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for promoting awareness about road safety under a scheme titled ""Grant of financial assistance for administering Road Safety Advocacy and awards for the outstanding work done in the field of Road Safety"". It is envisaged that the NGOs will undertake activities for creating road safety awareness among citizens.

A mobile App and Toll- free Emergency number 1033 for highway users, developed by NHAI, were launched in March this year. The SukhadYatra mobile application provides information on toll gates. The key feature of the app includes a provision for the user to enter road quality-related information or to report any accident or pothole on the highway. It also provides users with real-time data related to waiting time expected at toll plazas and various facilities like points of interest, highway nest/ nest mini, etc. The app can also be used to purchase FASTags.

The toll-free number 1033 will enable users to report an emergency condition, or highway-related feedback, across the highway. The service has also been integrated with ambulance / tow away services along the roads.

This Ministry observed the 29th National Road Safety Week from 23to 30April 2018. This year's focus was on schools and commercial drivers and the theme was ""Sadak Suraksha JeevanRaksha"". In the opening ceremony the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways emphasized the Ministry's priorities in ensuring safety of road users in the country. Awards were given to 10 school children who won the national level essay competition on road safety. The Hon'ble Minister also administered the road safety pledge to all those present on theoccasion. A variety of programmes related to the Road Safety were also organized in several cities across the country to enlighten people on Road Safety, and Driving Rules. Many NGOs participated in the Ministry's efforts to create awareness about the issue.

The Ministry had constituted a group of State Transport Ministers under the Chairmanship of Shri Yunus Khan, Transport Minister of Rajasthan to work out interstate issues and reach a consensus on adoption of uniform rates of taxation, permits and other issues. A Group of Transport Ministers from 13 states met in Guwahati on 18-19 April this year and adopted a 9-Point Guwahati Declaration aimed at harmonization of taxes and permits, road safety measures, policy changes and measures for strengthening State Road Transport Undertakings. The most important decisions taken by during the meeting included the recommendation for One Nation One Tax for the diverse road tax structure, which would ease travel.

In order to help accident victims in getting reasonable and fast compensation from insurance companies, the Ministry revised the relevant rules of the Motor Vehicles Act according to which every accident victim or his next of kin will be entitled to a compensation of Rs 5 lakh in case of death, and uptoRs 5 lakh, proportionate to the extent of injury in case of grievous hurt and disablement. Accident victims can claim higher compensation through court if they are not satisfied, but with this rule even the poorest of the poor will get a fast and reasonable compensation.

A Central Command and Control Centre is being set up at the NHAI HQ for CCTV surveillance and Monitoring of Vehicular Congestion at 210 Fee Plazas of National Highways that have higher traffic volumes. it is proposed to be connected with Regional Offices and the project execution is on service model for a period of five years.

Three short films for generating public awareness for the need to comply with the rules of the road, eventually contributing to the cause of road safety, were launched by Hon'ble Minister for Road Transport & Highways, on 14th' August, 2018. Film actor Shri Akshay Kumar who featured in these films on pro bono basis, has also been appointed as Road Safety Brand Ambassador by the Hon'ble Minister.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways has designated the Asian Institute of Transport Development as an apex body for capacity building in the area of road safety. The objective is that this centre would act as a depository of research studies and best practices.Human resource development and exchange of knowledge form an important component of its activities. Up to October 2018, the National Centre for Road Safety has been able to train over 1,400 professionals in road safety and road safety audit by conducting 31 courses pan India.

The Ministry took several initiatives in the transport sector during the year to make road travel more convenient for people. Some of these areas under-

To improve ease in licensing, this Ministry has simplified the driving license application form. Four forms i.e. (a) Learner License, (b) Driving License, (c) Renewal of License, and (d) updation of Address - all have been consolidated into one. The new form will enable Aadhar based verification of the applicant's identity to provide online services for renewal, change of address etc. Another highlight of the new form is that it would capture an applicant's willingness for organ donation.

The permissible safe axle weight of goods vehicles was revised and increased by about 15% to 20 % for different configurations of axles. The decision was taken with a view to help in increasing the carrying capacity of goods transport vehicles and bring down logistics cost. The amendment will increase the carrying capacity of goods vehicles by about 20-25 % and lower logistics costs by about 2%. It will also bring down the incidence of overloading. While automobile technology and road construction quality have improved greatly over the years, the axle loads have remained the same since 1983 when they were last notified. There was a felt need to harmonize the axle load with international standards.

NHAI has developed a matrix-based methodology to rank the Fee Plazas on parameters such as electronic tolling, time taken in clearance of FASTag lanes, display panels, staff behaviour, cleanliness, etc. The data for the matrix is to be collected by the Regional Officers who will use the same to rank the Fee Plazas under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, a countrywide drive was launched by NHAl on more than 300 toll plazas across the country on 10 February, 2018, to address issues that affect highway users. Officers visited toll plazas and addressed issues of user convenience and took feedback from the people.

The Ministry has revised the maximum speed of various classes of vehicles vide notification dated 6th April 2018. The notification prescribes the speed of various classes of vehicles. Thus a passenger vehicle with not more than 8 seats including driver can have a maximum speed of 120 km/hr on expressways and 70km/hr on municipal roads.

An advisory has been issued by the Ministry to all the States / UTs to accept the documents in electronic form through DigiLocker platform of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India and the mParivahan mobile app of the Ministry of Road Transport & Highways. Such electronic records available on DigiLocker or mParivahanare deemed to be legally recognized at par with the original documents as per the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This will also address Grievances / RTI applications of the citizens and facilitate promotion of Digital India campaign.

With a view to enhancing the safety of women passengers, detailed standards for Installation of Vehicle Location Tracking Device (VLT) and Emergency Button on public service vehicles have been notified on October 25, 2018. The States/ UTs have been mandated to ensure compliance of the rule and check fitment and functional status of the VLT device in the public service vehicles at the time of checking of the vehicles for fitness certification. The Command and Control Centres in the States will be used to provide interface to various stakeholders such as State emergency response centre, the Transport authorities of the state and central governments, device manufacturers and their authorized dealers, testing agencies etc. The Command and control Centre will also be able to provide feed to the VAHAN database or the relevant data base of the state with regard to over speeding and the health status of the device.

As per this notification the renewal of the fitness certificate in respect of transport vehicle up to eight years old shall be done for two years and for one year for vehicle older than eight years. No fitness certification shall be required at the time of registration for the new transport vehicle sold as fully built vehicle and such vehicle shall be deemed to be having certificate of fitness for a period of two years from the date of registration.

The Ministry has issued a notification for Dual fuel usage which covers Emission of smoke and vapour from agriculture tractors, power tillers, construction equipment vehicles and combine harvesters driven by dual fuel diesel with Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Bio-Compressed Natural Gas (Bio-CNG) or Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) engines.

Keeping in view the need for promoting electric mobility and alternate fuels, the Ministry, vide notification issued on October 18, 2018, has exempted Battery Operated Vehicles, as well as vehicles driven on Methanol fuel or Ethanol fuel, from the requirement of permit for carrying passengers or goods.

A system has been developed and tested by this Ministry for linking of Pollution Under Control (PUC) data with the VAHAN database. An advisory dated October 1, 2018 has been issued to all the States by the Ministry wherein all the PUC vendors have been directed to comply with the guidelines and facilitate electronic uploading of emissions test data to VAHAN database.

To give a distinct identity to the electric vehicles, it has been decided that the registration mark will be exhibited on a number plate with Green background. A notification to this effect was issued on 7th August, 2018.

The Ministry issued a notification regarding the blending of Gasoline with methanol in order to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions and also to reduce the import burden on account of crudepetroleum fromwhichgasolineis produced.The Hon'ble Prime Minister had announced an ambitious target of reducing 10% import dependence of oil and gas by 2022 from 2014-15 levels. Methanol can be used as an alternative transportation fuel thereby reducing Import dependence to some extent.

The Ministry has requested IRDA and the MDs / Chairpersons of all general insurance companies on to ensure that no third-party insurance policy is issued or renewed without ascertaining the availability of a valid PUC. This has been done following orders of the Supreme Court of India.

The Ministry has notified emission standards for Construction Equipment Vehicles and Tractors. These standards would be implemented w.e.f. 1 October, 2020 (Trem IV) and from 1st April, 2024 [Bharat Stage (CEV/Trem)-V]. This would help in ensuring environment friendly construction / mining activities.

The Ministry notified the insertion of the item 'Quadricycle' as a 'non-transport' vehicle under the Motor Vehicles Act 1988. A Quadricycle is a vehicle of the size of a 3-wheeler but with 4tyres and fully covered like a car. It has an engine like that of a 3-wheeler. This makes it a cheap and safe mode of transport for last mile connectivity. Quadricycleswere only allowed for transport usage under the Act, but now has been made usable for non-transport also.

6.1 National Award on e-Governance to INAMPRO

The ""INAMPRO"" project initiated by NHIDCL, a CPSE under this Ministry, has been conferred with a 'Gold' award under Category- I ""Excellence in Government Process Re-engineering"" for the National Award in e-Governance by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.

6.2 Electronic Toll Collection (ETC)

The Electronic Toll Collection Program has seen exponential growth in terms of number of Fastags sold and user fees collected electronically. With a total number of 440 Toll Plazas, more than 34.3 lakh Fastags units have been issued till October this year, and 25 to 27% of the revenues are being collected using the ETC mode. Use of FASTag has also seen significant growth, both in terms of user fees collected and penetration, from Rs 210.1 Cr with 13.1% penetration in April 2017 to Rs 44ó. 8 Cr with 24.8% penetration in the month of August 2018.

6.3 Linkage of PFMS with Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) and BhoomiRashi

The two IT initiatives of this Ministry, which are aimed at expediting pre- construction processes relating to bidding and land acquisition respectively, have now been integrated with the Public Financial management System (PFMS). The Bidder Information Management System (BIMS) is aimed at streamlining the process of pre-qualification of bidders for EPC Mode of contracts for National Highway workswithenhanced transparency and objectivity. The BhoomiRashiportal of Ministry of Road Transport & Highways allows for totally digital and paper-less processing of land acquisition cases, and has resulted in transparent, quick, corruption-free and error-free handling of land acquisition cases. It has alsomade the possible real-time tracking of activities and generation of reports relating to land acquisition. Revenue records of about 7 lakh villages across the country have been integrated in the portal. This digital change has drastically reduced the time taken for issuance of land acquisition notifications from 3-6 months to 1-2 weeks. Over 2000 notifications have already been issued by the Ministry in the first eight months of this financial year that while during the past two years, about a thousand land acquisition notifications could be issued every year. The process has also brought transparency in the system. Earlier the approved compensation amount used to be parked with the CALA (Competent Authority for Land Acquisition) but with BhoomiRashi portal this amount directly transferred into the account of the person concerned, through Public Financial Management System which is an integral part of the portal. In addition to this, the process is also environment friendly since there is no physical movement of files - all work is done digitally.

An advisory has been issued by this Ministry wherein the citizen can produce the transport related documents such as registration, insurance, fitness and permit, the driving licence, certificate for pollution under check and any other relevant documents, if required, in physical or electronic form, on demand by any police officer in uniform or any other officer authorized by the State Government in this behalf. This would enable the use of digital platforms for carrying and verification of the documents and is a step towards citizen facilitation and to ensure so that citizen are not harassed/ inconvenienced.

The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways signed a MoU with Transport for London (TFL) on 10January, 2018. TFL is an agency that manages the transport system for Greater London, and has demonstrated its capability by creating strong and dependable public transport system in the city of London. It has created a unique system of operating buses in PPP model with over 17 operators under a single brand. The MoUis aimed at using the expertise of TFL to revamp the public transport architecture in the country.

After a long hiatus, the 2nd meeting of India-Nepal Cross Border Transport Facilitation Working Group was held at Kathmandu on 23rd February, 2018 under the India-Nepal Motor Vehicle Agreement for regulation of vehicular traffic between the two countries.

The trial run started from Dhaka on 23rd April and reached Kathmandu on 26th April 2018. The participating countries have also agreed to conduct more trial runs for cargo vehicles under the agreement.

The first Working Group meeting of BIMSTEC to negotiate the draft text of Motor Vehicles Agreement for the regulation of passenger and cargo vehicular traffic among and between member states was held in April this year. Delegations from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Thailand, Sri Lanka and Myanmar attended the meeting. The draft text of the agreement was discussed and amended. The member countries will further examine the amended text.

An MoU was signed between the Central Materials Laboratory (ML), Kampala, Uganda and the Indian Academy of Highway Engineers (IAHE) under Ministry of Road Transport &Highways, India, during the visit of the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India to Uganda on 24-25 July, 2018, for establishment of a Regional Materials Testing Laboratory for Highways in Uganda.

The 5th India-Japan Joint Working Group Meeting in the Roads and Road Transport Sector was held on 12th November, 2018 in New Delhi as provided under the Framework of Cooperation (FoC) between the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH), India and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT), Japan. In the meeting, information regarding the latest technological developments in ""Operation and Maintenance of Expressway"", ""Development of Mountainous Road in North East Regions"" and ""Countermeasure of Aging Structure"" etc. was shared.

The proposal for a MoU on Bilateral Cooperation in the Road Transport & Road Industry sector, between Ministry of road transport & Highways and the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, has been approved by the Union Cabinet in its meeting on October 3, 2018.

While the procurement process is under way for the development of Wayside Amenities of larger sizes in PPP mode along the National Highways, the NHAI has taken up construction of 314 numbers Highway Nest (mini). These are being developed near Toll Plazas, approximately 200 meters downstream on a 10mX20m paved platform and comprises of facilities like toilets, water, ATR, a small kiosk with Tea / Coffee vending machine and packaged food items for Highway users.

The SwachhtaPakhwada was organised by the Ministry between September 15, 2018 and October 2, across all National Highways. Several activities related to shramdaan and cleaning of schools in villages adjacent to the National Highways were also organized by the NHAI during the period. Construction of toilets, both for men and women, installation of litter-bins and hoardings at NHAI toll plazas have been taken up by the Ministry under Swachh Bharat Mission. The Ministry was conferred with a special award for its implementation of the Swachhta Action Plan for 2017-18 by the nodal Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation."

Advait Rao Palepu reports.

Nearly two-and-a-half years after the Reserve Bank of India published a cybersecurity framework for all commercial banks, banks are having a tough time finding the people needed to give them the necessary protection.

While top banks outsource a significant cyber-security exercises and operations to consultancies and security firms, many smaller banks stand to lose out because they lack the same deep pockets.

For the past three months, we requested several meetings with Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) at the top public and private sector banks, seeking information on the status of implementation of the RBI's circular. However, the banks declined to comment.

There are two essential core security exercises that banks have to conduct on their network, periodically, as opposed to day-to-day security checks.

The first is Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) and the second is Comprehensive Security Testing (CST).

""About 90% to 95% of VAPT and CST exercises are done by tools and generally today 75% of these tests are done by the Big 4 (consultancies) because they have the tools and overseas experience,"" says a senior public sector bank official.

""For day-to-day activities,"" says Syndicate Bank CEO Mrutyunjay Mahapatra, ""banks are trying to build a team of people who are certified with cyber-security skills and have risk management experience.""

""However, there are very specific areas such as audits that are outsourced because they are process and technology intensive,"" Mahapatra adds.

Since these ""significant"" aspects of cyber-security operations are outsourced, the attrition/retention risks are passed on to the vendor, whether to one of the Big 4 firms or a security services company, he says.

Experts said since the RBI's initial circular in 2016, almost all commercial banks have implemented the technical aspects related to cyber-security, including routine network upgrades and vulnerability testing, but governance and a talent shortage remain key pitfalls.

""While there is an improved symbiotic threat, intelligence sharing amongst the CISO community in India and proactive measures are taken to avoid similar incidents, but there's definitely a huge need for advancements in current security incident logging and monitoring practices,"" says Kartik Shinde, partner on cyber security at EY India.

""Around 90% of the cyber-attacks investigated by us have shown low maturity in the way logging of incidents and events is implemented, which leaves little or no room for doing a thorough investigation. Forget thinking about the next generation security operations centres,"" says Shinde.

In an era of hacking and growing cyber-threats emanating from State or non-State actors, banks have to improve 'trust' with their customers and therefore depend entirely on their cyber-security technology, internal governance frameworks and the people running these operations.

As banks rapidly embark on their digital journey, the attack at surface levels will continue to increase and the attack vectors will get sophisticated.

As regulations become stringent and cost of compliance continues to rise, organisations need to invest significantly on analytics, automation and security platforms that will ease the burden, says Shree Parthsarathy, partner at Deloitte India.

Unfortunately, the deployment of technology -- by roping in consultancies or buying enterprise security software -- and finding the 'right' talent, are both a function of the banks's investment and spending capacity.

This leaves the top commercial banks with the 'latest' technology and 'best' talent, while smaller rural or cooperative banks may stand to lose.

Sanjay Katkar, chief technology officer, Quick Heal Technologies, says the top public and private banks spend around 5% of their budget for cyber-security whereas the global standard is around 9% to 10%.

""Many banks and institutions believe that if they spend large amounts of money on technology, cyber-security problems will be solved. But security products are only tools and companies need to find the right manpower to handle these issues. I find that many of the CISOs at cooperative banks are not knowledgeable about these threats and technologies,"" says Katkar.

""Banks are taking cyber security very seriously,"" says a lawyer helping banks develop their cyber-security policies, ""but are finding ways to avoid certain tough decisions. For instance, in some banks the CISO's role has been clubbed under the chief technology officers's ambit, which is not ideal.""

Barring in-house employees, banks and other organisations routinely contract freelance cyber experts or 'white-hat'/ethical hackers, but they lack experience in dealing with different network systems.

""Most such security experts have managed small-scale systems or have worked on one or two application systems, whereas the entire banking system or even a single PSB may have multiple types of systems which could run into the hundreds,"" says Mahapatra.

Given the shortage of cyber security talent available for banks to hire as full-time employees, there is a high attrition rate.

The strength of a bank's network security and the ability of their staff to respond to cyber threats depends entirely on the governance framework and training given to their entire staff, across departments.

While top banks can afford to purchase high-end deception technologies and build strong security operations centre(s), they also have 'purchasing power' in terms of attracting the right talent.

This means that the security of smaller banks and of their customers's deposits/information will be left behind, as was witnessed in the recent Cosmos Bank hack."

The sand of Versova was hidden under decades of plastic and other debris thrown back by the sea -- in some areas there was five feet of filth. And so Afroz Shah, an advocate, and an elderly neighbour set out to rectify the situation one day in October 2015. Within a few years, their efforts had led to what UN environment chief Erik Solheim called the largest and most inspirational beach clean-up in the world.

The duo -- the elderly neighbour later passed away -- inspired other locals to pitch in. Soon, the trickle of volunteers turned to hundreds and then thousands. There was a social levelling in this effort which attracted police troops as well as celebrities, retirees and youth from local slum colonies.

Early on, they would dig out plastic from hardened sand with gloved hands. Then Shah got help from civic authorities who allotted staff and some machines, a tractor and a JCB. Actor Amitabh Bachchan donated two more machines. And the BMC continued to send its contract staff.

Shah believes that ""mindsets and habits need to be changed"" at both individual and institutional levels to encourage environmentally-friendly decision making. The first Indian to be given the title 'UN champion of the Earth', Shah says he believes in working directly on the ground and with people. He plans to expand his work to other ""flashpoints of nature's devastation"". First on the agenda: the filthy Mithi River."

Twelve teams will be in and the rest will be left figuring out how to be in next year. Of course, there will be changes. Teams will huddle Monday and discuss them, with some franchise-altering moves on the way.

Prior to the finale, here is a snapshot look at those teams mulling changes in the AFC (for a look at potential NFC coaching changes, click here):

Jets: The Jets are expected to fire coach Todd Bowles after four seasons, sources say. By this point in the season, all parties know this is coming. Bowles was asked about his job performance on Friday and said, ""The record says it all."" Three seasons in a row with, at most, five wins doesn't cut it. Bowles should draw interest from other teams with head-coach vacancies, possibly being interviewed in Arizona. When this opening is created, it will be coveted -- thanks in part to the presence of QB Sam Darnold. Packers coach Mike McCarthy and former Lions coach Jim Caldwell figure to be among the candidate the team seeks to interview. GM Mike Maccagnan is believed to be safe, though it's unclear what would happen if a candidate demands total control.

Dolphins: On its face, the resume over the past three years is respectable, including one playoff appearance and a chance at a .500 record. But inside the building, there is a ways to go. Those who make up the power triumvirate do not all see eye-to-eye, and change is on the way. No firm decision has been made by owner Stephen Ross on who stays and who goes, and sources say all options are on the table. But Ross is not happy. There is, in fact, a legitimate possibility that coach Adam Gase ends up out of work, sources say. His status is up in the air, to say the least, and he is not safe. If Gase gets fired, he'll quickly emerge as one of the top head-coach candidates, as Browns owner Jimmy Haslam has long been a fan.

Ravens: The Ravens attempted to remove all intrigue by announcing that coach John Harbaugh was going to coach with the team in 2019 and hopefully beyond. That stands. Baltimore aims to work out an extension, and Harbaugh's agent Bryan Harlan was in town to talk Sunday night. But there is a real possibility that Harbaugh coaches next year without signing and opts to play it out. That would give Harbaugh and new GM Eric DeCosta an extra year to figure out if they can mesh while also transitioning to the Lamar Jackson era. If Harbaugh does leave, he'd be among the, if not the, top candidate available -- one reason why Baltimore kept him.

Steelers: Whether or not they make the playoffs, coach Mike Tomlin is not in trouble. Far from it, even if their season is derailed by a kicker slipping and their team MVP fumbling with the game on the line. But if there are changes, they could come on the defensive side. Coordinator Keith Butler could move on or retire, while several assistants could be changed out. It would be a tinkering, not an overhaul.

Browns: Even after the surging second half of the season, Browns interim coach Gregg Williams isn't considered a front-runner or anything close for the full-time job. He will, however, receive an interview. Cleveland is expected to cast a wide net and has no mandate to keep both coordinators, despite their success. Either way, Freddie Kitchens has earned the right to be a coordinator somewhere. Among those expected to be considered or inquired about are McCarthy, Iowa State coach Matt Campbell, Patriots de facto defensive coordinator Brian Flores and offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels, and Colts defensive coordinator Matt Eberflus.

Bengals: Unlike last year, there is no expectation owner Mike Brown will move on from coach Marvin Lewis. But that could change during a meeting between the two parties, which is likely to take place Tuesday. Lewis could also retire. The thought process when Lewis re-upped after 2017 was that it would be a two-year agreement (even if it's merely a one-year contract with a team option). Brown and Lewis will meet, discuss the plan to move forward, and then decide if they want to move forward together. Though it's unclear what it indicates, staff members were given itineraries for Monday and Tuesday during a staff meeting that included Brown this week, colleague Tom Pelissero reports. Final word on if they all return comes next week.

Jaguars: While coach Doug Marrone is believed to safe, the Jaguars are looking for a new offensive coordinator. Nathaniel Hackett was already jettisoned and whoever the new coordinator is will try to thrive in a post-Blake Bortles world. Defensive coordinator Todd Wash's status has not yet been decided. The unit is still strong statistically -- fifth in points allowed, for instance.

Broncos: Trying to predict the final outcome of a decision made by Broncos GM John Elway is risky. To be clear, none has been made. But after struggling down the stretch during an up-and-down second season, the likelihood is that coach Vance Joseph out of work. Several sources in-tuned with this situation believe there will be an opening. There is the slim possibility that the Broncos win and Elway rides the momentum to another year with Joseph. But that seems to be the only caveat. What complicates matters is that the offense struggled again this season, and QB play was an issue. Elway realizes the offense must improve and exist more on the cutting edge. That's why one possibility -- if Joseph sticks around for another year and moves on from coordinator Bill Musgrave -- is for Gary Kubiak to come down from the front office and serve as the OC. That could shore up the offense and give Joseph one final year to prove his worth. Otherwise, the Broncos could be looking for their sixth head coach in 10 years.

Salil Parekh is set to complete a year as managing director and chief executive (MD & CEO) at Infosys, the information technology major. A period in which he was able to bring stability at the top, giving clear direction and assuaging many concerns of shareholders on growth at the country's second-largest entity in the segment.

Taking over when the board of directors and the company's founders were at loggerheads, Parekh has led the Bengaluru-headquartered firm to a zone of safety. While realigning the focus to its roots as a services company.

Nevertheless, his term has also seen some exits at the top level. The resignation of then chief financial officer M D Ranganath was the most prominent. Also, reduction in the operating margin target and a high staff attrition rate have raised concern among investors.

Parekh also seems to have been able to win the trust of the founders to a large extent, the tenure having been free of friction so far, unlike his predecessor.

Infosys also bagged a $700-million contract from Verizon, as part of which it is in the process of rebadging around 2,500 employees of the US telecom major.

Analysts think the willingness to go for such deals also reflects more flexibility under the new regime; traditionally, it had kept away from this route.

Parekh's stint was also marked by an emphasis on ensuring Infosys remains a services-driven. His predecessor, Vishal Sikka, was seen veering the course for a product play. Parekh aggressively pursued a digital-heavy strategy, making smaller acquisitions while also linking the compensation of top executives to digital revenue flow. Appointment of consultants McKinsey to advise on sharpening of sales strategy and embedding of digital specialists at large client accounts were part of this.

""Acquisition of WONGDOODY and Fluido are a good start and setting up of digital hubs are impressive. His steps towards revising employee compensation upward and linking it to digital technology skills is a great move for organic development,"" says Phil Fersht, founder & CEO at HfS Research.

Infosys's partnerships in Singapore with Temasek and in Japan with Hitachi, Panasonic Corporation and Pasona would add to solid Asia-Pacific presence, Fersht added. Parekh as also preferred to continue with the company's localisation effort, especially in America.

Parekh seems to have been able to win back shareholders. The share price went from Rs 506 on January 5 to Rs 656.95 this Friday, a 30 per cent rise (albeit supplemented by the rupee's fall). Under his watch, Infosys also made a 1:1 bonus issue for shareholders.

Some add that Infosys still has a long way to go in coming closer to the performance of larger peer Tata Consultancy Services.

TCS recorded double-digit revenue growth in the first two quarters of 2018-19. It also clinched a number of large deals over the year. Rising staff attrition also continues to be a major issue before Parekh, with the figure well above 20 per cent in the past two quarters.

""Though Infosys has definitely done well under the new CEO, it is yet to be seen whether itcan challenge the industry leader. In that, this year will be the real test for Parekh's leadership,"" says a Mumbai-based analyst."

Senior CPI(M) leader M Y Tarigami Sunday expressed concern over the plight of the working class, saying the government's neo-liberal economic policies had adversely affected them.

""We are concerned over the plight of the working class who is adversely hit by the neo-liberal economic policies pursued by the government which are drastically affecting the workforce in the state,"" Tarigami said addressing a day-long convention of different trade unions here.

The convention deliberated upon various issues and problems confronting the working class with the determination to intensify struggles to fight anti-people policies of the government.

Tarigami, who is also the state president of Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), said the implementation of demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax have had serious ramifications on the livelihood of the working-class people.

The employment situation has worsened under the neo-liberal regime with steep fall in permanent jobs and increase in precarious jobs like contract, casual, temporary, fixed term, part time, apprentices and trainees.

""The situation has further worsened after the systemic crisis which started in 2008 and is still continuing,"" he said.

""Such crises are integral to the capitalist system and the employers seek to protect their profits by shifting the burden on to the workers. Increasing unemployment is one of the outcomes of this,"" he added.

The Communist Party of India(Marxist) leader said the joint trade union movement was raising the demand for employment generation since long.

""It has been demanding that the concessions and exemptions being given to the big corporates should be linked to job creation. But the government totally ignored the demand,"" he said.

He said while every year tax exemptions of around Rs five lakh crore are given away to the big corporates, employment generation has seen a negative growth.

""Money due to the government is money due to the people. That is being waived off on the pretext that this will create jobs,"" he said.

""But this has become a chimera. Net employment generation is turning negative. Whatever employment that is created, is of very poor quality, indecent, with no job security, income security or social security,"" he added.

The convention appealed the workers and employees to make two days general strike on January 8-9 next year, called by the central trade unions, a success.

""The BJP is trying to hide behind the ED which has now become an 'embarrassing disaster'. The Modi lead government is the benefactor, protector, abettor and supporter of AugustaWestland,"" said Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala.

The recently revised standard contract agreement for national highways Centrally-sponsored road works proposed to be implemented on EPC basis could lead to a decline in the pace of new project awards in the short to medium terms, with the pending land acquisition being a primary constraint, warns a report.

""While the pipeline of projects to be awarded remains strong with the Bharatmala Pariyojana gaining ground, the land acquisition issues could delay the awarding,"" rating agency Icra said in a weekend report.

The target for FY19 is to award 20,000 km projects with majority to be awarded on the EPC mode, it noted.

""Given the land acquisition related issues, and stringent provisions in the revised EPC contract agreement, it is likely that the NHAI will proceed with awarding of contracts only once the land acquisition is in advanced stage,"" it said.

However, it noted that the revision is expected to facilitate execution of road contracts by reducing bottlenecks faced by contractors particularly related to right of way, and clearances.

The report further says in case of delays due to default on the part of the contractor, provision of deemed debarment for bidding in new projects is expected to push pressure on contractors to timely complete projects.

""The changes in the EPC agreement are steps in positive direction. With the stricter provisions for damages, the liability has increased for both the authority and contractor to meet their obligations in a time-bound manner. This in turn is expected to facilitate timely execution.

""However, over the short-to-medium term, this could lead to a decline in the pace of new project awards, with the pending land acquisition being a primary constraint,"" said Abhishek Gupta, an assistant vice-president at the agency.

As per the revised terms, the authority has to provide at least 90 per cent of the required right of way of the construction zone of the total length of the project highway, which shall be in contiguous stretches of not less than 5 km.

""By broadening the right of way requirement to 90 percent of the construction zone and 5-km contiguous stretch, the execution challenges are expected to be lower,"" he said.

With defined timelines for deemed termination, and associated provisions for damages, the agency expects the authority to proceed with contract awards only when these conditions are met.

""Similarly, with respect to the contractors obligations, non-achievement of project completion within 90 days of scheduled date will lead to deemed debarring of the contractor from bidding for future projects till this project achieves completion (for projects with contract value more than Rs 300 crore),"" it said.

For the Indian oil and gas sector, the year was defined by what occured outside with crude oil prices rising steadily to cross $86 a barrel owing to oil producers starting output cuts from January, before a sharp correction in the third quarter brought it down to below $50 earlier this month.

Consequently, 2018 saw petrol and diesel prices scaling record highs daily under the dynamic pricing regime for transport fuel prices introduced last year, even as the rupee plunged to new lows against the US dollar in the second half of the year, leading to a soaring oil import bill and widening of the current account deficit. High fuel prices spurred the government to make excise cuts and increase its efforts to take India towards a gas-based economy.

In mid-May, the price of petrol in Mumbai breached the Rs 86-a-litre mark as fuel prices across the country increased for the 15th day in a row, surpassing fresh records daily.

Thereafter, following the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producers deciding in Vienna to raise oil production by some 1 million barrels a day, fuel prices in the country suddenly started declining in June.

Then in September, fuel prices resumed their daily record-breaking upward movement with petrol selling at over Rs 91 a litre in the country's financial capital and at around Rs 84 in Delhi.

Amid calls for bringing petroleum products under GST, the situation forced the government to cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 a litre each in early October. Additionally, the state-owned oil marketing companies (OMCs) were mandated to reduce prices by Re 1 a litre each.

Meanwhile, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan travelled to Vienna in June to convey India's view that the 13-nation OPEC should end the Asian Premium on oil being charged by the cartel and that prices have risen beyond the threshold that can be sustained by the world.

""There is the need for OPEC governments to move towards responsible pricing,"" Pradhan said.

Following the meeting, Saudi Petroleum Minister Khalid Al Falih told reporters that he expects Riyadh's oil production to rise in November from 10.7 million barrels per day (bpd) and that it has the required capacity in place to do so.

""Saudi Arabia has the capacity to produce 12 million bpd and is currently producing 10.7 million bpd and production will rise further,"" Al Falih said.

The decline in crude prices resumed sharply and UK Brent, for instance, fell from $86 a barrel to under $50 earlier this month, forcing oil producers to decide to reduce its supply by 1.2 million bpd for the first half of 2019.

Petrol and diesel in India have declined by nearly 15 per cent each from the record high levels they had reached in October.

Meanwhile, India received a US waiver to purchase oil from under-sanctions Iran and Pradhan announced that the Finance Ministry is working out the modalities of payment for imports from the Gulf nation.

Continuing its efforts to boost domestic production, the government this year launched the second round bidding for Discovered Small Fields (DSF) with 190 million tonnes of oil and oil equivalent of gas worth more than Rs 1 lakh crore. It is likely to fetch the government Rs 45,000 crore. Of the 25 contract areas on offer, 15 are onland fields and 10 are in shallow offshore areas.

The first round of bidding for DSF in 2016 had generated 134 bids for 34 contract areas of which 30 contracts were awarded. It saw entry of 13 companies that were new to the country's exploration and production industry.

An impressive Rs 5,900 crore of investment was committed for the exploration of 55 oil and gas blocks awarded through the first round of auctions under the new Open Acreage Licensing Policy (OALP). The OALP, under the new Hydrocarbon Exploration and Licensing Policy (HELP), allows the investor to carve out blocks of their choice and submit an Expression of Interest throughout the year.

In August, the cabinet approved a policy framework for the exploration of hydrocarbons, permitting private companies to exploit unconventional hydrocarbons, including shale gas and coal bed methane (CBM), from their existing acreages.

In a major step towards ushering in a clean gas-based economy, India launched its biggest auction of city gas distribution (CGD) networks, offering permits for selling compressed and piped natural gas (CNG and PNG) in 86 geographical areas (GAs) to bring gas to around half of the country's population in 26 states and union territories. The tenth CGD bidding round was also launched subsequently in 50 GAs spread over 124 districts in 14 states.

In a major move on sustainable development, the government brought out the National Biofuels Policy for a sector poised to become an economy worth Rs 1 lakh crore, aimed at providing a cost-effective, pollution-free import substitute to polluting fossil fuels.

The policy details the architecture for India to make the move towards adopting second generation, or advanced, biofuels in the future, from the current first

generation ones being used, which are essentially sugar-based.

In the notable foreign investment in the sector during the year, the Ratnagiri Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (RRPCL) was created as a 50:50 joint venture between Indian state-run OMCs with Saudi Aramco and Abu Dhabi's national oil company ADNOC. The mega refinery will be capable of processing 1.2 million bpd of crude oil by 2022, or 60 MT per annum.

The total incidence of tax on the SPGS would increase to 8.9 per cent with implementation of the GST Council recommendations finalised on December 22, 2018, which would be effective from January 1, 2019.

""...keeping in line with government endeavour to promote the renewable power sector and considering the specific facts of the solar sector, the entire contract for supply of SPGS should be taxed at the concessional rate of 5 per cent,"" the SPDA said in a letter to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley last week.

The industry body also said, ""The present recommendations (of the GST Council) would run inconsistent and create a huge gap in the government policy and its implementation.""

The government has set a target of 175 GW of renewable power by 2022 which includes 100 GW of solar power.

In the 31st GST council meeting held on 22 December, 2018, the industry body recommended that in case of contracts for supply of SPGS, 70 per cent of the gross value of the contract would be deemed as the value of supply of goods and attract 5 per cent rate and the remaining portion (30 per cent) of the aggregate value of such EPC (engineering procurement and construction) contract shall be deemed as the value of supply of taxable services attracting standard GST rate.

Elaborating further, the SPDA informed that in case of contract for supply of SPGS, the scope of work primarily includes supply of goods.

It said, ""It is pertinent to note that services are incidental to the contract and are minimal in the whole scope of work (not being more than 5 per cent of the total contract value). For the purposes of clarification, we have in last 8 months provided the Ministry of Finance with all the necessary evidences including the cost break-up of every single part installed in SPGS and EPC contract documents executed in the industry.""

It submitted that providing concessional rate of 5 per cent on only 70 per cent of the gross value of the contract for supply of SPGS would result in higher tax rate on supply of SPGS as compared to the erstwhile excise and service tax regime.

The SPDA said, ""The effective tax rate will be 8.9 per cent, which is considerably high as compared to 1.5 to 2 per cent in pre-GST era.""

It also said that the GST Council recommendations shall lead to increase in cost of electricity not only for future projects but also for many operating plants wherein the power purchase agreement executed between DISCOMs and solar developers provides pass-through on the GST implication.

The body stressed in the letter that the entire contract for supply of SPGS (including service portion) should qualify as supply of SPGS and should be taxed as supply of SPGS at the concessional rate of per cent.

She has approached the police after KMC denied any wrongdoing on its part and stated that she did not contract the virus due to the transfusion.

Lalitha*, who has a five-year-old son, was initially getting treatment at a primary health care centre in Mangadu during her second pregnancy. Four months into her pregnancy in March, she did a blood test at the Sri Muthukumaran Medical College Hospital & Research Institute. The results said that she was HIV non-reactive or negative but her heamoglobin count was found to be very low. Following this she was taken to KMC on May 5 and given two units of blood. She was discharged 10 days later after the doctors saw improvement in her platelet count. But on August 18, when Lalitha and her husband Kumaran* went back to KMC for a checkup, doctors conducted another blood test on both of them. While Kumaran's tests said he was HIV negative, Lalitha tested positive for the virus.

In her complaint letter, Lalitha says, ""We fought with the hospital staff and said that they have completely ruined our lives. But they said you are infected now and need to get treatment. We request you to take action against the Dean, the doctors and other staff."" She further stated that she did not see how she can take on the hospital given her family's limited means.

Both Kumaran and his wife are vegetable sellers. The child, a boy, was then born in September in KMC and has so far, tested negative for the virus. In November, Lalitha then wrote to Health Minister Vijayabhaskar, Health Secretary J Radhakrishnan and to the Dean of KMC alleging medical negligence.

But Dean P Vasanthamani who spoke to TNM, denied the allegations.

""As soon we got the complaint, a committee was formed and an inquiry conducted into the matter.

The professors said that it is an injustice to them as the difference in pay scale between the two commissions is around Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000.

Moreover, even though they are ad hoc (temporary basis) professors, the workload is equal to that of permanent staff and only the pay scale and additional security differs.

""This is victimisation of our professors. Just because we are on a temporary basis, does not give them (the university) the liberty to exploit us in anyway,"" said a professor on the condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, another professor, who is serving as an assistant professor at a Churchgate-based college, said, ""Currently, I am being paid around Rs 45,000 while as per the state's clause of the sixth pay commission I should be getting more than Rs 62,000. Adding to this, there is no security provision for us either from the university or college.""

Recently, the state government approved the seventh pay commission where the salaries and related allowances of state staffers including teachers and professors were cleared.

The state government had earmarked a sum of Rs 10,000 crore in the state budget for 2018-2019 to revise the pay scales of the employees.

A good number of ad hoc professors are in every department and sub-campus of the university.

""The only drawback apart from the personal problems we face is the lack of motivation we professors struggle with on a daily basis.

Alfred Paolo Conteh was detained along with Sannah Marrah, the defence ministry's former director general, at the Criminal Investigation Department on Friday. Both are awaiting charges, the Sierra Leone Anti Corruption Commission said.

The commission said officials are investigating allegations of corruption over procurement of military vehicles, uniforms and rice in 2015. The procurement contract was reported to be worth USD 10 million.

""We are recovering monies stolen from our people,"" anti-corruption commissioner Joseph Ben Kelfalla told reporters in Freetown, adding that authorities had recovered more than one million dollars from corrupt officials.

Most of the military supply deals were done in China, according to a report published in 2015 by the Sierra Leone audit services that identified flaws in procurement procedures.

President Julius Maada Bio took office in early April after a tumultuous election campaign in which he targeted corruption, ending a decade-long rule by the All People's Congress (APC).

Soon after he took office a report commissioned by the new government charged that ""rampant corruption"" in the former administration had led to the ""near collapse"" of the West African nation's economy.

The government has approved a commission of enquiry, with hearings expected to begin in January 2019.

Several former government ministers including the ex-vice president Victor Bockarie Foh have been arrested this year on corruption allegations.

The APC has slammed the probe, calling it a ""witch hunt"" and vowing not to cooperate with the commission of enquiry.

""The government will not tolerate any intimidation, indiscipline and incitement from any political party,"" a senior official at the Ministry of Information and Communication told AFP.

""The fight against corruption will continue and the commission of enquiry will commence in January,"" the senior government official said.

One of the world's poorest nations despite huge mineral and diamond deposits, Sierra Leone's fragile economy is still recovering from war and disease, including a 2014 Ebola epidemic.

IT technician David McCutcheon, employed by New Mexico's Department of Information Technology (DoIT), filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico against the Communication Workers of America (CWA) union, CWA Local 7076 union, and New Mexico Personnel Office Director Justin Najaka on December 20 with free legal aid from National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation staff attorneys.

McCutcheon's suit states that CWA officials seize unauthorized membership dues out of his paycheck and refuse to allow workers to opt out of union payments except during a union dictated ""window period."" The lawsuit asks the court to end this scheme and seeks a refund of union membership dues and fees for all New Mexico public workers who were similarly victimized.

Union officials forced McCutcheon to pay nonmember union fees to keep his job beginning in April 2017. However, in Janus v. AFSCME on June 27, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional to require any public employee to pay union membership dues or fees without his or her explicit consent.

Following the Janus ruling, McCutcheon informed union officials in writing that he did not consent to any deduction of union fees. Union officials responded that his request had been ""submitted for processing.""

But, instead of halting deductions, union officials began seizing full membership dues, rather than the lesser nonmember fees, from McCutcheon's wages without his permission starting in September. According to union officials, under the union contract McCutcheon could only stop these larger deductions by again revoking authorization during the annual two-week December ""window period.""

Because union officials refused to respect his legitimate request, McCutcheon has asked the district court to recognize his First Amendment rights to free speech and free association in accord with Janus and strike down this unconstitutional ""window period"" scheme. McCutcheon also seeks a refund of membership dues and fees seized from himself and the likely hundreds of other public employees in New Mexico who have been similarly victimized during the past three years.

""Contrary to the wishes of New Mexico union bosses and their allies in state government, First Amendment rights cannot be limited to just a couple of weeks per year,"" said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation. ""All civil servants should be able to exercise their rights to free speech and free association by cutting off union payments whenever they choose without interference by union officials.""

""Unfortunately, even after the Foundation-won Janus decision by the Supreme Court, it appears more legal action is necessary to force union officials to end their 'massive resistance' and respect the rights of the very workers they claim to represent,"" added Mix.

The National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation is a nonprofit, charitable organization providing free legal aid to employees whose human or civil rights have been violated by compulsory unionism abuses. The Foundation, which can be contacted toll-free at 1-800-336-3600, assists thousands of employees in more than 250 cases nationwide per year."

The following article is from the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation's bi-monthly Foundation Action Newsletter, November/December 2018 edition.

Foundation staff attorney William Messenger argued Janus at the Supreme Court. The Foundation's victory must be vigilantly enforced.

SPRINGFIELD, VA - Since the 2012 passage of Right to Work legislation in the Wolverine State, Foundation staff attorneys have provided free legal assistance to Michigan workers in more than a hundred cases. With 41 ongoing cases and another 61 closed as of the publication of this article, Michigan cases continue to make up a disproportionate amount of the Foundation's caseload of approximately 220-230 active cases at any given time. Developments in Foundation legal cases in recent months show that despite dozens of victories for workers, Michigan union bosses continue to attempt to force workers to pay dues despite the Right to Work laws.

These federal lawsuits are among dozens of legal actions workers have pursued, with the assistance of Foundation staff attorneys, to enforce the Supreme Court's Janus ruling. As decades of Foundation litigation has amply demonstrated, without relentless enforcement, Big Labor ignores precedent and violates the rights of rank-and-file workers.

In California, Foundation staff attorneys are assisting Mark Smith, a court worker in Contra Costa County, who attempted to exercise his new protections days after the Janus decision.

Mr. Smith submitted his resignation from membership in American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Local 2700 and told union officials they did not have his authorization to deduct union dues from his paycheck.

AFSCME officials continued siphoning Mr. Smith's hard-earned money without his consent and despite his multiple attempts to resign. When Mr. Smith sent his resignation via certified mail, postal service records show union officials left the delivery unclaimed.

After his requests were repeatedly ignored, Mr. Smith came to Foundation staff attorneys for free legal aid in filing a federal lawsuit against AFSCME officials and his government employer.

In the complaint, Mr. Smith challenges union officials' violation of his First Amendment rights and a California law requiring public employers to deduct dues at the union's request, even if the worker revokes authorization. This egregious law, enacted mere hours after the Janus decision, also blocks public employers from informing employees of their Janus rights.

In Pennsylvania, school bus driver Michael Mayer attempted to exercise his rights under Janus just weeks after the ruling. He resigned his membership in the Teamsters union on July 20 and hand-delivered a notice in August demanding that his employer stop deducting membership dues from his paycheck.

However, Teamsters Local 312 officials refused to honor his resignation, and his employer, Wallingford-Swarthmore School District, continued withdrawing union dues from Mr. Mayer's hard-earned wages.

Teamster bosses claimed Mr. Mayer only had a 15-day window to escape from the union's new monopoly bargaining contract under a section of Pennsylvania's Public Employee Relations Act (PERA). Such a policy directly conflicts with the Supreme Court's Janus ruling, which held that dues taken without workers' clear and knowing affirmative consent violate the First Amendment.

When dues continued to be seized from Mayer's paycheck in September, Foundation staff attorneys filed a federal lawsuit against the Teamsters union and the school district for violating his rights.

The lawsuit seeks a refund of the dues that the Teamsters conspired to take without his consent after his resignation and asks the court to rule that the PERA violates his First Amendment rights by restricting his ability to resign union membership and stop paying dues.

""Unfortunately, though not surprisingly, rather than work to earn the voluntary support of the workers they claim to represent, union officials coast-to-coast are resorting to illegal schemes to block workers from exercising their rights under the Janus decision,"" said Mark Mix, president of the National Right to Work Foundation. ""These cases likely won't be the last challenging attempts to prevent workers from exercising their Janus rights."""

A Delhi court hearing the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper case on Saturday imposed restrictions on alleged middleman Christian Michel meeting his lawyers in ED custody after the agency said that he was misusing legal access by passing chits to the advocates asking them how to tackle questions on ""Mrs Gandhi'.

While seeking extension of Michel's remand, the Enforcement Directorate claimed that he made a reference to 'Mrs Gandhi' during questioning and spoke about the ""son of an Italian lady"" and how he is going to become the next prime minister of the country.

The agency, however, did not state in what context Michel had made these references during interrogation.

The ED sought that Michel be barred from meeting his counsel in its custody, alleging that he was tutored from outside through the lawyers, following which the court directed that the three defence counsel will be able to meet Michel one at a time at a distance from the accused and legal assistance will be only for 15 minutes at 10 am and at 5 pm during a day.

The order came after Michel was Saturday produced before vacation judge, Chandrashekhar, who extended his ED custody by seven days.

The agency told the court that Michel had made a reference to 'Mrs Gandhi' during interrogation on December 27. During medical examination, the accused had handed over a folded paper to his advocate Aljo K Joseph and it was noticed by ED officials. After perusal of the paper, it was revealed that it pertained to a set of follow-up questions on 'Mrs Gandhi', the ED said.

The development intensified the war of words between the BJP and the Congress on the issue with the ruling party attacking Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, claiming that the ED's statement pointed towards involvement of their family in the alleged scam.

Rejecting the charge, the Congress hit out at the BJP-led government at the Centre, accusing it of using agencies to put pressure on Michel to ""name a particular family"" as elections were near and ""it has no real issues"".

The ED told the court that it is clear that there is a conspiracy to shield or to tamper with evidence that could be brought forth from questioning of the accused. ""The benefit given by the court to the accused of legal access is being misused. It should be stopped henceforth,"" the agency said.

The agency said it has discovered fresh evidence relating to new entities, used for laundering the proceeds of crime and Michel's custodial interrogation was needed for confrontation with his Indian connections identified till date.

It said he was also required to be taken around Delhi to identify the places where he held meetings and used them as hide outs to give bribes or to entertain officials and public figures.

His custody was required for ""unearthing the deep-rooted conspiracy and identification of all his accomplices including the IAF officials, MoD (Ministry of Defence) officials, bureaucrats and politicians who gained undue advantage for getting the contract in favour of AgustaWestland,"" the ED said in the application, adding he remained evasive to some questions during the investigation.

The accused is trying to introduce new alibis to save himself and his aides who have received/facilitated in laundering of proceeds.

Michel, who was extradited from Dubai recently, was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on December 22 and sent to seven days custody of the agency over money laundering charges in the scam after he was produced in a court here. He was earlier lodged in Tihar Jail in the related CBI case.

Michel is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the case by the ED and the CBI. The others are Guido Haschke and Carlo Gerosa.

The ED said that investigation has revealed that Michel was the key middleman for AgustaWestland, pursuing the deal at different levels and was instrumental in circulation of sensitive information and payment of kickbacks.

The agency said his custodial interrogation was essential to further determine the role of various accused persons in the commission of the offence for money laundering, the money trail and payment of kickbacks, etc.

It was also required to unearth how the kickbacks were routed and laundered, the carriers involved in facilitating the money laundering, the places where the proceeds of crime are parked and how/by whom.

The key issues being investigated by the ED are the modus operandi adopted by the accused to eliminate TATA and HAL from competition in an Italian deal and the steps undertaken to mask the present deal as a British deal instead of an Italian deal to gain advantage in Light Observation Helicopters.

It also includes the modus operandi adopted in managing to influence the German deal and how the accused violated, misused information leading to actions under the Official Secrets Act.

The agency said the questions prepared for Michel have not been answered as he was writing slowly and his statement remains pending on various key aspects.

The ED said it needs to ascertain the quantum of commission received by Michel from AgustaWestland and the kickbacks forwarded to other middlemen, IAF official, Indian bureaucrats and politicians.

The agency needs to determine the exact quantum of money laundered through Media Exim Pvt Ltd, the roles of co-accused/ other aides and for unearthing the proceeds of crime parked through this channel.

The ED had filed a charge sheet against Michel in June 2016.

The BJP Saturday seized on ED's statement in court that AgustaWestland case accused Christian Michel had made a reference to ""Mrs Gandhi"" and the ""son of an Italian lady"" during its probe and attacked the Gandhi family, alleging that the truth about it is coming out now.

Union ministers Prakash Javadekar and Ravi Shankar Prasad also hit out at Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Prasad accused him of showering Prime Minister Narendra Modi with abuses and asserted that ""today is the time for the Gandhi family to explain"" following the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) statement in court.

The Congress has rejected the charge, saying the central government has been using agencies to implicate the Gandhi family.

In a sharp attack, Javadekar told reporters that the statement of Michel, who is accused of being a middleman and is under arrest, points to one family which, he claimed, has now been caught.

""The ED's disclosure in the court has made it clear that truth can no longer be suppressed. The truth about the Congress and Sonia Gandhi and Rahul is coming out before the people. The people will give the Congress a befitting reply,"" he said.

The country was earlier aware of two words, ""family"" and ""AP"", about the VVIP chopper case but Michel has now taken a few more names by referring to ""Mrs Gandhi, big man, son of Italian lady, party leader and R"", Javadekar said.

Prasad claimed Michel was a very key player in the case who was brought to India with due deportation process.

""He has taken Sonia ji's name and also given indication about Rahul Gandhi in a chit passed to his lawyer. The raajdar (one carrying secrets), Michel, is disclosing the involvement of others. Today is the time for the Gandhi family to explain. As far as the Congress is concerned no deal is complete without a deal,"" he claimed.

Referring to Rahul Gandhi's attacks on Modi over Rafale in which he also used the thief barb at him, Prasad said the Congress president showered abuses at the prime minister who, he asserted, is an epitome of integrity and honesty.

Rahul Gandhi should now explain his position on Michel's statement, he said.

With the Congress accusing the government of pressuring investigation agencies to implicate the Gandhi family, Prasad claimed the Congress had caged them but they are now allowed to do a fair job.

Javadekar said the UPA government ""looted"" the county and also compromised with the national security.

""The Congress never finalised a transaction without a middleman. While it is busy in saving the likes of Michel, the Narendra Modi government is working to save the country's money and bring back what was looted earlier,"" he said.

The BJP had accused the Congress of providing lawyers to Michel. The Congress had removed a party functionary after he appeared as a lawyer for the citizen of the United Kingdom.

Javadekar also described the Congress' attack on the government as a case of ""thief making noises"" and claimed that Michel had also spoken about the public sector firm, HAL, being removed from the Rafala contract during the UPA rule.

Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has vowed to pass legislation as soon as she takes the gavel, which is expected when the new Congress convenes, to reopen the 15 shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown.

""If they can't do it before January 3, then we will do it,"" said Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., incoming chairman of the Rules Committee. ""We're going to do the responsible thing. We're going to behave like adults and do our job.""

But even that may be difficult without a compromise because the Senate will remain in Republican hands and Trump's signature will be needed to turn any bill into law. Negotiations continue between Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill, but there's only so much Congress can do without the president.

Trump is not budging, having panned Democratic offers to keep money at current levels -- $1.3 billion for border fencing, but not the wall. Senate Republicans approved that compromise in an earlier bill with Democrats but now say they won't be voting on any more unless something is agreed to by all sides, including Trump.

""I think it's obvious that until the president decides he can sign something -- or something is presented to him -- that we are where we are,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who opened the Senate on Thursday for a session that only lasted minutes.

""Call it anything,"" he added, ""barrier, fence, I won't say the 'w' word.""

Trump long promised that Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico refuses to do so.

Federal workers and contractors forced to stay home or work without pay are experiencing mounting stress from the impasse.

As the partial shutdown stretched toward a second week, Ethan James, 21, a minimum-wage contractor sidelined from his job as an office worker at the Interior Department, wondered if he'd be able to make his rent. Contractors, unlike most federal employees, may never get back pay for being idled. ""I'm getting nervous,"" he said. ""I live check to check right now.""

For those without a financial cushion, even a few days of lost wages during the shutdown could have dire consequences.

Roughly federal 420,000 workers were deemed essential and are working unpaid, unable to take any sick days or vacation. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay.

Like James, Mary Morrow, a components engineer on contract for NASA, is in a predicament. In addition to caring for a family largely on her own, she's got a mortgage.

""I have three teenage boys, it's near Christmas time and we just spent money, there are credit card bills and normal bills and it's really nerve-wracking,"" she said. ""It's scary.""

Steve Reaves, president of Federal Emergency Management Agency union, said the shutdown could have consequences that stretch beyond a temporary suspension of salary. Many federal government jobs require a security clearance, he said, and missed mortgage payments or deepening debt could hurt their clearance.

David Dollard, a Federal Bureau of Prisons employee and chief steward for the American Federation of Government Employees Local 709 union in Colorado, said at least two agency employees lost their homes after the 2013 shutdown suspended their salaries. Bureau of Prisons employees are considered essential, and must work without pay. The agency is already understaffed, Dollard said. Shutdown conditions make everything worse.

""You start out at $44,000 a year, there's not much room for anything else as far saving money for the next government shutdown, so it puts staff in a very hard situation,"" he said. ""We've got single fathers who have child support, alimony. It's very hard to figure out what you're going to do.""

Candice Nesbitt, 51, has worked for 1½ years for the U.S. Coast Guard, the only branch of the military affected by the shutdown. About 44,000 Coast Guard employees are working this week without pay; 6,000, including Nesbitt, have been furloughed.

Nesbitt worked for a contractor but took a pay cut in exchange for the stability of a government job. She has a mortgage, is the guardian of her special needs, 5-year-old grandson, and makes about $45,000 a year, she said. Any lapse in payment could plunge her into debt. ""It shakes me to the core,"" she said."

The news will come as a boost to the Hammers, who moved into the top half of the table with a 2-1 win away to Southampton on Thursday, after Rice rejected an initial offer earlier in the season.

Rice's previous deal was due to run out at the end of next term, leading to fears he could leave West Ham for nothing were he to move to a rival club when that contract ran out.

The London-born Rice has been capped by the Republic but not in a competitive fixture, leaving the door ajar for a call-up by England manager Gareth Southgate.

But while he ponders his international future, Rice was pleased to have committed his club future to West Ham, a club with a long tradition of nurturing young players.

""I'm absolutely delighted to have got the contract done, signed and to commit my future to the club until 2024. I'm absolutely ecstatic,"" he said.

""Without a doubt, the plan was always to stay at West Ham. I've had the support from the fans, from the players and from the manager (Manuel Pellegrini) and now, to get it done and commit myself to this club is a very special moment.

""I'm still young, so to put more years on my contract and keep developing here is the best thing for me to do now. With the support of the manager, the players, everyone, it was the right thing to do.

Brent crude oil fell 56 cents to a low of $51.60 a barrel before recovering some ground to trade around $52.05 by 1300 GMT, having earlier risen more than 3 percent. The futures contract dropped 4.2 percent on Thursday.

U.S. light crude was last up 30 cents at $44.91, after rising 3.6 percent in early trade.

Oil prices fell to their lowest in almost 18 months this week and are down more than 20 percent for the year, depressed by rising U.S. supply and concern over global economic growth.

Stock markets in Europe and Asia rose on Friday after Wall Street ended a volatile session with big gains, but fears of further price swings and worries about U.S. politics kept investors cautious.

Traders appeared to be squaring their books ahead of expected light volumes on Monday and a market closure on Tuesday for the New Year's Day holiday.

""Looks like some people in the U.S. and U.K. got a nice opportunity to bail out of longs,"" Sukrit Vijayakar, principal and trader at Trifecta Consultants in Mumbai, told Reuters Global Oil Forum.

Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, said crude prices had been pressured by slowing economic growth ""coupled with the expectation of strong U.S. production in the new year"".

U.S. crude inventories rose 6.9 million barrels to 448.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 21, according to the American Petroleum Institute. The U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA) will publish its data at 1600 GMT.

""If the EIA's data shows a rise in U.S. crude inventories, that would cap price gains,"" Ahn said.

Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, agreed to cut output by 1.2 million bpd, or more than 1 percent of global consumption, starting in January.

New Delhi [India], December 28 (ANI): The Defence Acquisition Council (DAC), headed by Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, is expected to discuss acquisition proposals worth over Rs 5,000 crore at a high level meeting likely to be held in the next few days.

One of the proposals likely to be made pertains to the acquisition of three naval cadet training ships for training young cadets of the maritime force, defence sources told ANI.

The ships would be required to be built under Make in India in the defence category and Indian shipyards would be allowed to participate in the tender.

The tender is being reissued by the Navy as a private shipyard had earlier failed to deliver the vessels under a contract signed around five years ago. Due to the delays, the Navy is being forced to restart the acquisition process again.

Cadet Training Ships are used by the Navy to train its young officers and sailors along with those of the Indian Coast Guard.

During the meeting, a Coast Guard proposal to acquire six maritime surveillance aircraft for enhancing security along the coastal areas of the country is also likely to be discussed.

The surveillance equipment for these six aircraft would be developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and would be equipped on a transport plane likely to be acquired by the Indian Air Force for replacing its Avro aircraft.

The Air Force is also likely to place a proposal related to its Modernisation of Air Field Infrastructure (MAFI) project, under which all the air bases will be upgraded for operating all types of fighter aircraft.

After her elevation as Defence Minister, Sitharaman had decided to hold the DAC meetings twice every month to clear all the pending proposals of armed forces for acquiring weapon systems.

The DAC is the highest Defence Ministry body to take decisions on all matters related to acquisition of weapon platforms and systems.

Those facing penalties are Jay Jyoti India, Lalit Gulati, Liberal Properties, Lokesh Kumar Goyal and Doubledot Finance.

The regulator conducted a probe into the trading activities of certain entities in illiquid stock options on the BSE from April 2014 to September 2015 after observing large-scale reversal of trades in the BSE's stock options segment.

The probe found that over 81 per cent of all the trades executed in the BSE's stock options segment were the ones which involved reversal of buy and sell positions by the clients and counterparties in a contract.

The five entities were among those clients whose reversal trades involved squaring off transactions with significant difference in sell and buy values of the transactions.

""The noticee, by engaging in non-genuine transactions which created a misleading impression of trading in respective contracts, dealt in the stock options contracts in a fraudulent manner in violation of .... PFUTP Regulations, 2003,"" Sebi noted in five similar-worded but separate orders.

By doing so, the firms have violated the PFUTP (Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices) Regulations.

Accordingly, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has levied a fine of Rs 25 lakh on Jay Jyoti India and Rs 5 lakh each on Lalit Gulati, Liberal Properties, Lokesh Kumar Goyal and Doubledot Finance.

In April, Sebi announced to take action in a phased manner against 14,720 entities for fraudulent trade in illiquid stock options segment and passed several orders in past few weeks against such entities.

In a separate order on Wednesday, Sebi levied a penalty of Rs 10 lakh on three promoters of Timbor Home Ltd for violating insider trading and takeover norms.

The regulator conducted a probe between April 2014 and May 2015 and found that the shareholding of the firm's four promoters decreased from 29.90 per cent to 0.29 per cent.

The promoters had transferred more than 25,000 shares of the company through off-market and on-market transactions to related entities. However, they failed to make disclosure about the same to the company and exchanges as required under PIT (Prohibition of Insider Trading) and SAST (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) norms.

""Noticees had, pursuant to their repeated sale transactions, substantially reduced the promoters' shareholding in the company in clandestine manner as they failed to make timely disclosure in the prescribed form about the relevant details of their transactions,"" Sebi said.

Accordingly, it imposed fine of Rs 4 lakh each on Suresh Chandra Maloo and Maloo Building Materials and Rs 2 lakh on Manan Vidhyapati Patel.

Earlier, the senior teachers had submitted a memorandum to former VCs to extend their retirement age from 60 to 65. Sources, however, indicated the varsity would fix the retirement age at 60. A university order, sent to 29 UIT centres in the state earlier this year, specified that engagement of staff on contract basis is not permitted after the age of 60 years and hence asked principals of UIT centres not to forward the engagement requests of staff above the age of 60. The rule also applies to those who are completing the age of 60 during the contract ending period in March 2019. The order has many senuior teachers worried.

""Since we have no pension, we will be left high and dry without any income after retirement. However, if the university proceeds with that action, we have only one demand. UIT principals' retirement age is 65. So we request the university to hike the age limit to 65 for all teaching staff,"" said Sreekumar (name changed), a senior teaching staff.

At present, the UITs have both contract and guest lecturers in service. The principals of the centres are the retired professors from government educational institution. Of 29 centres, many teaching staffs fear they might lose the job if the university failed to extend the retirement day.

According to M Lenil Lal, former University Syndicate member, there were differences of opinion in the former syndicate over raising the retirement age of senior staffs of UITs and a final call on this would be made in January. ""We did discuss this issue in many syndicate meetings. But there was no consensus. Some members wanted to raise the age of teaching staff while some wanted to appoint young teachers to give them the opportunity. So we have not decided yet on this and our priority would be to raise this issue in the first syndicate meeting to be held in January. We hope that the issue gets resolved in January itself,"" he said.

Most of the teachers in UITs are highly qualified and took up their job in the hope that sooner or later their service would be regularised. Meanwhile, University of Kerala vice-chancellor V P Mahadevan Pillai told Express the matter has not been brought to his attention. ""I am unaware of this issue as it has not been brought to my attention. So I am not authorised to comment now,"" said Pillai.

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

US stocks ended higher at Comex on Thursday, 27 December 2018. Thursday's stock market featured another tale of two sessions. The bulk of the trading day was marred by an inclination to sell into strength, which fed into worries that this market had more downside to come. The last part of the trading day, however, featured a huge rally from session lows that eviscerated the downbeat sentiment seen in the first part of the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 260.37 points, or 1.1%, to end at 23,138.82, after dropping as much as 611 points at its session low. The S&P 500 also erased a sharp decline to rise 21.13 points, or 0.9%, finishing at 2,488.83. The Nasdaq Composite erased a loss of more than 3% to close at 6,579.49, a gain of 25.14 points, or 0.4%.

The materials, industrials, financials, and health care groups led the broad market advance.

Meanwhile, a leading U.S. dollar index that measures the buck against a half-dozen rivals, eased back by 0.6% to 96.46.

Reviewing Thursday's economic data, it included the weekly Initial and Continuing Claims report, the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for December, and the FHFA Housing Price Index for October. Initial claims for the week ending December 22 decreased by 1,000 to 216,000 while continuing claims for the week ending December 15 decreased by 4,000 to 1.701 million. The key takeaway from the report is that initial claims continue to print at low levels that don't suggest any meaningful softening has occurred in the labor market despite the concerns about a slower growth outlook.

The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index decreased to 128.1 in December from a revised 136.4 (from 135.7) in November. The key takeaway from the report is that consecutive declines in the Expectations Index point to a growing belief that the pace of economic growth will decelerate in the first half of 2019.

Separately, the FHFA Housing Price Index increased 0.3%, up from an unrevised September increase of 0.2%.

Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Thursday, 27 December 2018. Gold futures settled solidly higher on Thursday, inching to a fresh six-month high as the dollar eased and U.S. stocks retreated following a surge the day after Christmas.

Gold for February delivery on Comex rose $8.10, or 0.6%, to $1,281.10 an ounce. The contract has closed higher for three consecutive sessions, marking the highest finishes for a most-active contract since June 2018. March silver closed up 18.7 cents, or 1.2%, at $15.310 an ounce.

Bullion's moves come as stocks fell sharply on Thursday following a major bounce a day earlier from the heaviest Christmas Eve losses on record. European stock markets also closed sharply lower.

Crude-oil prices settled sharply lower on Thursday, 27 December 2018, fresh off the biggest one-day rally for futures in more than two years.

West Texas Intermediate crude for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell $1.61, or 3.5%, to $44.61 a barrel, while the global benchmark, February Brent crude declined $2.31, or 4.2%, to settle at $52.16 a barrel on the ICE Europe platform. Both crude grades have fallen four of the past five sessions and seven of the past nine.

Overall, the crude market has been heading lower because many investors have been fretting that efforts to remove a recent oil glut haven't sufficient, amid economic sanctions imposed by the U.S. against by the U.S. against Iran, one of the world's largest oil producers and a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Saudi Arabia and other major oil producers had raised production as global supplies tightened ahead of Tehran sanctions, but as they came into effect in early November, the U.S. granted waivers to eight nations, including China, allowing them to temporarily continue to import Iranian crude.

U.S. Treasuries closed on a higher note, pushing yields lower, before stocks mounted their late-inning rally. The 2-yr yield declined seven basis points to 2.53%, and the 10-yr yield declined five basis points to 2.74%.

Looking ahead, investors will receive Pending Home Sales for November on Friday.

Sydney's S&P-ASX 200 gained 0.7 per cent to 5,634.30 and benchmarks in New Zealand, Taiwan and Southeast Asia also rose.

US stocks staged a last-minute turnaround that put the market on track to end the volatile week with a gain. That followed the market's best day in 10 years. Health care and technology companies, banks and industrial stocks accounted for much of the gains.

The Standard & Poor's 500 rose 0.9 per cent to 2,488.83 after being down 2.8 per cent at midday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.1 per cent to 23,138.82. The Nasdaq composite added 0.4 per cent to 6,579.49.

The downturn that began in October has intensified this month, erasing all of the market's 2018 gains and nudging the S&P 500 closer to its worst year since 2008.

TOI, in its edition of the December 26, had reported the chilling incident where in the accused Dinesh Koli (39) molested the patient inside the ICU ward, but was saved in a nick of time by an alert neigbouring patient.

The NHRC has called for a detailed report within four weeks in the matter including action taken against the guilty and relief and rehabilitation as well as counseling provided to the victim. The NHRC has also asked whether such incidents have occurred in the past in any of the government hospitals if yes, what steps have been taken by the authorities to ensure safety and security of the indoor patients at the government-run hospitals, the press release read.

The commission has observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, amount to gross human rights violation of the victim.

The shameful incident occurring at a government-run facility raises a question mark on the safety of the patients, particularly the female patients in the hospital, the release stated.

The accused, a contract worker deployed in the particular ward, was sweeping and arranging the ward while one hand of the victim was tied to the bed to prevent the saline drip from falling out during a seizure. The accused allegedly tied the other hand of the patient to the bed and started touching her inappropriately, while it was noticed by another patient in the room who alerted the staff.

This followed the government's announcement that it would look to move more than 6,000 civil servants to Canary Wharf to save money and reduce Whitehall office buildings. HMRC's agency estates director has recently confirmed that more than 2,000 HMRC staff are already benefiting from the hub's ""modern flexible workspaces, great IT and excellent transport links"". It is estimated that £20 billion of savings may be achieved in reduced running costs over 20 years. A further 14 regional hubs have already been announced.

So what could private sector employers learn from the government's focus on smart working?

Day-to-day employee occupancy may be reduced by allowing some homeworking, or flexible working. This may enable employers to increase staff numbers or the concentration of employees, without overcrowding. Employers may also introduce shared spaces for collaboration, and quiet areas for work requiring an intense focus. Spaces may also be shared with partner or mutually interested organisations to promote collaborative working.

Businesses should consider:

1. There may be ways in which their existing workplace could work better for it and its employees. Potential benefits may include:

2. If a relocation is on the horizon, this can be sold as a positive change. Potential benefits may include:

3. Cultural changes may make a drastic difference to output and engagement without being particularly costly. Potential benefits may include:

Employers should sensibly consider all the implications of any potential move to smart working, and invest some time in planning before making any changes to working practices. In particular, employers should think about the need to draft, or update, company policies on homeworking, lone working, confidentiality and information security to ensure that their valuable information is not compromised by any such change. Employers should also make sure that employees are aware of the company's data protection requirements. If employers decide to enter into space-sharing arrangements with third party organisations, they may need to draw up commercial agreements with those parties to ensure that their valuable and private information is adequately protected.

Any office relocation may result in the need to change employees' terms and conditions. Employers should check if they have the benefit of any flexibility in affected employees' contracts of employment (mobility clause), to change the affected employees' normal place(s) of work, or whether this could amount to a redundancy situation. Such clauses may, if properly drafted and relevant in all the circumstances, avoid the need for the employer to go through a formal consultation with the affected employee(s) to change their contractual place of work. Advice should be taken before relying on such mobility clauses. Employers should be mindful that such clauses will be interpreted narrowly by the courts and tribunals and any ambiguity will be decided in favour of the employee. Notwithstanding this, the courts and tribunals do not go as far as to restrict employers to only make these changes ""reasonably"" or for ""genuine operational reasons"". Instead, employees are expected by the courts or tribunals to move their place of work, provided the new workplace is still within reasonable travelling distance of their home (Jones v. Associated Tunnelling Co Ltd [1981] IRLR 477 and Courtaulds Northern Spinning Ltd v. Sibson [1988] IRLR 305).

Even if employers do have the benefit of a mobility clause in employment contracts, they need to consider its interplay with other relevant clauses. In United Bank v. Akhtar [1989] IRLR 507 the employer, who wished to rely on a mobility clause, refused to exercise its express contractual discretion to pay relocation expenses. The tribunal held that the employer's actions breached three terms implied into the employee's contract, namely 1) that the employer should give reasonable notice of any move, notwithstanding the scope of the mobility clause, 2) the employer would not exercise its discretion to provide relocation expenses in a way which made the employee's performance of his duties under the contract impossible and 3) the employer would not act in such a way as to damage the relationship of trust and confidence between the parties. Employers should therefore always give employees reasons for any such proposed change and notice of when that change is expected to take effect if they want to avoid an argument that the implied duty of mutual trust and confidence has been breached.

Where there is no suitable mobility clause to rely upon, the move may amount to a redundancy situation. A redundancy consultation procedure should be followed, and the change of location be considered as potentially alternative employment in a redundancy situation (which may be subject to a statutory trial period).

In any new smart working environment, employers should ensure that they are applying a co-ordinated and consistent approach in the treatment of staff. This includes in dealing with requests for flexibility in working hours, or working arrangements. To avoid potential discrimination complaints, employers should also ensure that employees who spend a large amount of time working remotely have the same access to opportunities as their colleagues who spend more time physically present in the office. This can often be achieved by using technology to disseminate information. If employees feel that they are being treated less favourably than their colleagues, they may as a minimum raise a grievance or complaint about that treatment. Even if this is not well founded, it may incur management time and cost.

Smart working arrangements will not necessarily work for, or in respect of, all staff. There may be certain times that staff need to be physically present in the office to avoid an impact on business performance. There may be risks if too many employees are absent from the office at the same time due to remote working. Certain roles within the business may not be able to be performed from home, or remotely. However, most of these issues can typically be overcome with some prior planning. They will not necessarily be a reason to shy away from a new smarter way of working. As the recent government move has demonstrated, smart working is not only for employers looking to reduce their property costs, but can have real benefits for employers in respect of employee welfare, engagement, and recruitment and retention.

However, in the recent case of Pouvin v. Electricité de France (EDF) (Case C-590/17), this is exactly what happened, the effect being that the contract was then brought within the scope of certain laws designed to protect consumer rights.

In this case, EDF agreed to provide a loan to one of its employees, Mr Pouvin, and his wife to help them finance the purchase of a new home. The loan contract included a clause which stated that if Mr Pouvin left his employment with EDF, the loan would become immediately repayable.

In 2002, Mr Pouvin resigned from his role at EDF and subsequently stopped paying the loan instalments. EDF brought a claim against Mr Pouvin and his wife for the repayment of the outstanding sum, plus interest. Whilst Mr Pouvin and his wife argued that the repayment provision in the agreement was unenforceable under Unfair Contract Terms Directive (93/13/EEC) (the Directive), EDF took the position that the Directive did not apply because there was no supplier/consumer relationship in place. It was a pure employment relationship.

At first instance the French court upheld Mr Pouvin's position, holding that the automatic termination clause was unfair; however, the Court of Appeal overturned that decision, saying that EDF had granted the loan in its capacity as an employer only, and not as a seller or supplier under the Directive, meaning the Directive did not apply and so there was no need to consider the fairness of the loan contract.

Mr Pouvin then appealed to the Court of Cassation in France, which ultimately referred the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to decide whether the Directive applied to the loan or not.

The Attorney General (AG) has now given his view on this issue, in advance of the case being heard by the ECJ. Whilst his opinion is not binding, it tends to be persuasive and is often followed by the court.

In this case, the AG highlighted that the Directive is aimed at protecting consumers, who are in a weaker bargaining position than suppliers and who may therefore be forced to accept less favourable terms without negotiation. In reviewing the case, the AG commented that Mr Pouvin was clearly in a weaker position to EDF when entering into the loan contract in question because he was less informed, economically weaker and legally less experienced.

EDF tried to argue that it did not enter the contract in the capacity of a supplier, but the AG gave that argument short shrift. In particular, the AG commented that an employer can still be regarded as a supplier when acting outside the specific field of activity that corresponds to its realm of professional competence. Here, the AG said that the contractual arrangement was in fact ancillary to EDF's primary business activity and could be construed as conducive to the successful running of the business, because it had the aim of attracting and retaining staff.

EDF also argued that a recital to the Directive stipulated that employment contracts were specifically excluded from the protection of the Directive. However, the AG was also sceptical of that argument, pointing out that recitals are non-binding and that this could not be taken to mean that employment contracts automatically fall outside the scope of consumer relationships. The situation must always be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. In particular, the AG commented that it would be unfair if consumer-employees who are attracted to contract services or buy goods from their employers because of advantageous conditions being offered automatically lost their rights to consumer protection as a ""hidden cost"" for contracting with their employers.

Finally, EDF tried to argue that the loan contract was part of a social policy that sought to provide its employees with beneficial conditions, and that it was not seeking a profit for itself. The AG also rejected this argument, stating that the public or private character of the activity, the fact that it pursues a public interest objective, or that it is not carried out on a lucrative basis or for consideration, is not determinant of whether the Directive applies.

Taking these factors into account, the AG found that EDF had entered into the loan contract in its capacity as seller or supplier and passed the case back to the French courts for decision on the fairness of the loan contract under the Directive.

Whilst the AG's opinion is not binding, it raises potential red flags for employers who provide contractual benefits or arrangements to employees, such as car loans, mortgages, training costs and credit facilities. Such arrangements may fall within the scope of the Directive, as they provide an incentive for employees to stay with their employer, and are therefore ancillary to the successful running of any employer's business. This will be the case even if there is no visible profit for the employer arising from the contractual arrangement. Employers should therefore be aware that the terms of such arrangements could potentially be challenged as unfair under the Directive, although whether those terms are indeed found to be unfair is a separate question to be considered.

A group of 40 women rights activists has opposed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018, in its present form, raising concerns over 10 points in the Bill which was passed by the Lok Sabha Thursday.

In a statement, they urged the government to withdraw the Bill from consideration in the Rajya Sabha, and review the fundamental flaws pending broad-based community consultations.

Following are the 10 concerns raised by the activists.

1. This Bill disregards the fact that its very objective - to protect the rights of married Muslim women and prohibit divorce by pronouncing 'talaq' by their husband - has already been achieved by the judgement of the Supreme Court.

2. The Supreme Court in Shayara Bano's case held that the practice of 'talaq-e-bidat' is manifestly arbitrary, and therefore, unconstitutional. An act that has no legal consequences being made a criminal offence, cognizable and non-bailable is manifestly arbitrary and therefore, violative of Article 14.

3. There is no rationale to criminalise the practice of talaq-e-biddat and imprison Muslim men. The effect of the Supreme Court's judgment is that the marriage is legally valid and the persons continue to be lawfully wedded. Now, the Muslim men will be incarcerated, thus violating the rights of conjugality of these two persons. Criminalising the husband would also lead to unwanted separation between the couple, against the wishes of the wife.

4. Since Muslim marriage is a civil contract between two adult persons, the procedures to be followed on its breakdown should also be of civil nature. Penal action to discourage the practice of instant triple talaq is a myopic view as it leaves many other issues of economic and social security of women unaddressed.

5. The government should strengthen the negotiating capacities of women by providing them economic and socio-legal support rather than criminalising the pronouncement of triple talaq.

6. The pronouncement of triple talaq having no legal consequences on the marriage means that such a proclamation by a Muslim man is essentially a desertion of the wife. In any of the Personal Laws, the desertion of wife by a man is not a criminal offence. Therefore, while the Bill aims to criminalise the pronouncement of talaq, in effect, it is only criminalising the act of desertion of a Muslim wife by her husband. Criminalising desertion by Muslim men, which constitutes only a civil offence for men of all other religions, is discriminatory under the Constitution.

7. If there is violence within the marriage in addition to the pronouncement of triple talaq, the woman could use the existing provisions of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code. These two laws, taken together, represent a wide spectrum of legal options available for women survivors of domestic violence, encompassing both criminal and civil provisions.

8. No economic and socio-legal support is provided by the government in the Bill to women, children and other dependents, when the erring men are put behind bars. The Domestic Violence Act, 2005 under Section 21 already provides for the aggrieved woman to be provided custody of the child and Section 20 provides for maintenance to be paid to her. Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 also provides for maintenance for the aggrieved woman. In fact, the Bill takes a step back in only providing for subsistence allowance for the woman. Subsistence allowance is not defined and is open to interpretation.

9. The Bill allows for the aggrieved woman as well as anyone related to her by blood or marriage to be the complainant. There is no provision for a relative to seek the consent of an aggrieved woman before filing a complaint. The problem becomes particularly acute in the case of

inter-religious marriages of Muslim men with a woman of another religion.

10. The terms of imprisonment up to three years is arbitrary and excessive. Serious crimes like Causing death by rash or negligent act (IPC Sec 304A), Rioting (IPC Sec 147), Injuring or defiling place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class (IPC Sec 295) - all punishable by two years in jail or fine or both. All these criminal acts have lesser punishment than pronouncing triple talaq, which is arbitrary and excessive, and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.

The statement was signed by 40 activists and women's groups, including Ayesha Kidwai of Jawaharlal Nehru University, Kavita Krishnan of All India Progressive Women's Association (AIPWA), Shabanam Hashmi, Anhad and groups like Bebaak Collective, National Alliance of People's Movements (NAPM), Humsafar Support Centre, Kashmir women's collective, Mahila Sarvangeen Utkarsh Mandal (MASUM), People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), Women's Research & Action Group among others.

The Lok Sabha Thursday passed the Bill which criminalises the practice of instant triple talaq, with the government rejecting the contention that it was aimed at targeting a particular community.

The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 was passed by the Lower House with 245 voting in favour and 11 opposing the legislation.

A key organiser of Friday prayers in Noida's Sector 58 Thursday appealed to Muslims not to gather at a park, which was declared off-limits to

religious gatherings by the police, as permission has not been granted for holding prayers there.

The 45-year-old Adil Rashid, one of the organisers of the Friday namaaz at the park, told PTI he did not want to ""whip up"" any further controversy on the issue. Police said they will be monitoring the situation tomorrow.

Early this month, the Nodia Police had issued orders stating that Friday prayers cannot be held at the government plot as there was no requisite permission.

""I had made an application to the administration for permission to allow namaaz in the park and it has been denied. So I want to appeal to the people who may not be aware of this that please do not come to that park tomorrow, and find other appropriate place for offering namaaz,"" Rashid told PTI.

The 24-year-old Cleric Noman Akhtar, who claimed to have been leading the prayers in the park since 2013, said he won't be going there for the namaaz Friday.

Rashid and Akhtar were taken into preventive custody on December 18 for the ""unauthorised"" use of the park for prayers and then jailed for three days, they said.

Akhtar said he was only aware that the organisers had written to the authorities concerned for the permission, and he was asked by the organisers to come and lead the prayers, which is a usual practice.

""After the controversy erupted, I was asked on December 17 to come to the police station the next day for a meeting. I had no idea that I would be detained and then sent to jail,"" he told PTI.

""Now, I am getting calls from relatives and acquaintances asking me about the incident... I feel ashamed,"" he said. ""Now I will be cautious of reading prayers even in authorised public places.""

""Neither I want to be a hero, nor whip the controversy up any further on this issue. I am a simple man so I won't go the park tomorrow and request others also not to come there,"" Rashid said in his appeal.

Noting that a complaint was made to the local police that ""outsiders"" come and use the park without permission, he said most of the people offering prayers were workers of private companies and it was obvious for them to come from far off places.

""I have been living in Noida for last 33 years and even have a Noida Authority flat which was allotted to me in Sector 82 in 2004. I rent out RO filters and have a contract with two firms in Sector 58. I also sell small RO units locally. If I have work in this area, it is obvious that I'll find place for prayers in this area only,"" Rashid said.

He said the administration had cited a Supreme Court order to disallow the religious gathering in the public park, but asked if the apex court has also directed that the community not be provided space for offering namaaz when required.

Rashid said there are no mosques nearby and for reaching the nearest one also people would have to travel at least 7 to 8 kms.

""Most of the people who gathered here (in the park) are private company employees and it is not possible to manage to go there given the limited duration of lunch time. While in the park, it was only a matter of 10 minutes,"" he said.

He claimed that a mosque was to come up in Sector 12 but the matter has been pending for long with the communications between the administration and the Noida Authority not yielding any result.

""There are lakhs of Muslims in the district but very few mosques. There are two in Sector 8. Then in Khoda colony, which is not even in Noida, has small mosques where some people go. But it becomes difficult for so many people with limited designated places for prayers. This leads them to using streets and roads also,"" he said.

Akhtar said that in 2013 there would be lesser number of people attending the prayers and last Friday the number would have been around 1,500. He said people from other nearby sectors also used to join them in the park.

The work will take place at Foxconn's plant in Sriperumbudur town in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, said the source, who is not authorised to speak to the media and so declined to be named.

Foxconn, which already makes phones for Xiaomi Corp in India, will invest 25 billion Indian rupees ($356 million) to expand the plant, including investment in iPhone production, Tamil Nadu's Industries Minister M C Sampath told Reuters.

The investment may create as many as 25,000 jobs, he added.

Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment. Foxconn said it did not comment on matters related to current or potential customers, or any of their products.

Until now, Cupertino, California-based Apple has only assembled the lower-cost SE and 6S models in India through Wistron Corp's local unit in the Bengaluru technology hub.

Its sales in India have also been focused on lower-end phones - more than half of its sales volume is driven by models older than the iPhone 8, launched last year, according to technology research firm Counterpoint.

Apple launched the pricey iPhone X last year but has cut production of that phone, according to industry analysts, since it began selling the newer versions, iPhone XS and XR, globally this year.

Still, it could potentially get Foxconn to make the older iPhone X version in India where it sells cheaper models in a bid to get a bigger share of the world's fastest growing major mobile phone market.

Full details of Apple's deal with Foxconn are not yet clear and could change.

It is not known if any of the iPhone assembly is being moved from existing Foxconn factories in China and elsewhere. It is also unclear whether the production will be confined to assembly or include any component production in India.

Foxconn, the world's biggest electronics contract manufacturer, is considering setting up a factory in Vietnam, Vietnamese state media reported this month. If that goes ahead, it will be one of the biggest recent steps by a major company to secure an additional production base outside of China.

Foxconn has previously admitted the China-U.S. trade spat was its biggest challenge and that its senior executives were making plans to counter the impact.

""Widening iPhone manufacturing in India through Foxconn will allow Apple to hedge the risk of any new U.S. trade policies,"" said Navkendar Singh, an associate research director at International Data Corporation.

Indian taxes on import of devices and components have also heightened Apple's headache in a market where it has only a 1 percent share by smartphone shipments.

Making more phones locally will help Apple save costly duties and boost Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship drive to make India a manufacturing hub, Singh said.

Apple shocked investors last month with a lower-than-expected sales forecast for the Christmas quarter that jolted parts suppliers across the world.

Foxconn has previously expressed concern over demand for Apple's flagship devices.

Confirming that Ashwin will continue to lead the KXIP this season, Zinta provided the rationale behind picking Varun, who did well in the Tamil Nadu Premier League (TNPL), for such a humongous amount.

""Varun is an underexposed mystery bowler along with being a back-up spinner who will add value to the team. Kings XI Punjab has always wanted to give chance to untested talent and Varun is a long term investment for us,"" Zinta told PTI in an e-mail interview.

""I feel that with guidance from coach Mike Hesson, he (Varun) will be able to hone his capabilities and contribute to team's success,"" the Bollywood actor said.

She was happy that Kings XI were able to pick players whom the management thought could be the missing link from the last edition.

""We opted a thought through strategy for the 2019 VIVO Indian Premier League auctions. We wanted to pick up players that could fill in the missing gaps and create a remarkable team line-up.

""I believe that we have a balanced side now with a lot of good options in our kitty in case of requirements during the season,"" she said.

Teenagers like Prabh Simran Singh has landed a cool Rs 1.5 crore contract even before playing a single Ranji Trophy match but Zinta believes that if someone is talented, he should be backed.

""At the Kings XI Punjab, we have always believed in providing opportunity to domestic talent and Prabh Simran is the new star on the horizon. The management team at KXIP does a background research before bidding for any player,"" she reasoned.

She also spoke about the local connect which went a long way in bidding for Prabhsimran.

""We have faced such scenario in the past (2009 in SA and 2014 in UAE) and are adequately prepared for the upcoming season.

Eden Hazard offered Chelsea fans hope his future may remain with the Londoners by stating he wants to become a club ""legend"" like former team-mates Frank Lampard, John Terry and Didier Drogba.

Hazard scored his 100th and 101st Chelsea goals as Maurizio Sarri's men moved back into the Premier League top four by grinding out a 2-1 win at Watford on Boxing Day.

However, doubts remain over the Belgian's future with his contract set to expire in 2020 and persistent rumours over interest from European champions Real Madrid.

""It means a lot, especially because we won today also,"" said Hazard on reaching his Chelsea century.

""100th and 101st goal with this amazing club is something I will never forget, but now the fans, me, the staff, the players, we want more.

""I want to score more goals for this club and be a legend like Lampard, Terry or Drogba.""

Two of the three goals came in first-half stoppage time as Hazard's opener was quickly cancelled out by Roberto Pereyra's spectacular strike.

However, Hazard made sure he was the match-winner as he was brought down by Ben Foster and then converted the resulting spot-kick early in the second half to move Chelsea two points ahead of Arsenal in the battle for Champions League qualification.

Despite fuming at Chelsea's lack of focus in losing at Stamford Bridge for the first time in charge of the Blues to Leicester on Saturday, Sarri named the same starting line-up with Hazard again serving as the focal point of the attack ahead of Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata.

""Hazard can play in every position,"" said Sarri. ""Today he played very well with two goals and could have had a two or three assists.""

Chelsea's top scorer had to wait for his chances to come, but showed why Sarri persists with him through the middle as he coolly rounded Foster from Matteo Kovacic's pass to give Chelsea the lead.

Watford were level within two minutes as Jose Holebas's corner perfectly picked out Pereyra on the edge of the Chelsea box and the Argentine connected sweetly on the volley to find the bottom corner.

The hosts had claims for a penalty waved away when Gerard Deulofeu tumbled under a shoulder barge from David Luiz, but there was no controversy when at the other end moments later Hazard was hauled down by Foster.

Hazard picked himself up to dispatch the penalty confidently and by the end Chelsea's margin of victory should have been greater.

Willian and N'Golo Kante drilled low shots inches wide and Foster had to race back to his goal after going forward for a late Watford corner to deny Hazard his hat-trick with the last action of the game.

""We could have won with another result because in the last 20-25 minutes we missed opportunities,"" added Sarri. ""At the end of the match, we did very well, especially mentally."""

The minister, who is from the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), has clarified that he has nothing to do with the whole incident and has asked principal secretary of his department to order a probe into the matter.

In the same sting operation, secretary of MoS (Mining) Archana Pandey is shown striking a deal with the reporter for getting him mining contracts in about half-a-dozen districts.

The secretary S.P. Tripathi will be investigated by an SIT, the minister said, adding stringent action will be taken against her PS.

Santosh Awasthi, personal secretary to the MoS Basic Education, Sandeep Singh, is also seen in the sting operation ""working out a deal"" on a books contract and seeking his own cut in the deal. Sandeep Singh is the grandson of former UP chief minister and currently the Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh.

The sting operation has come has a rude shock to the Yogi Adityanath-led Bharatiya Janata Party government in Uttar Pradesh which has often spoken of probity and good governance.

The NHRC has taken suo-moto cognizance of media reports that a 39-year-old sweeper allegedly tied the hands of the seizure patient to the bed in the ICU and molested her. The police subsequently arrested the accused.

The Commission has sought a detailed report from the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra including the action taken against the guilty and relief and rehabilitation or counselling provided to the victim.

The NHRC has also asked the government to respond within four weeks whether any such incidents have occurred in the past in any government hospital and the steps taken by the authorities to ensure safety and security of the indoor patients.

The Commission has observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, amount to gross human rights violation of the patient.

""The victim girl was in the lawful custody of the hospital and it was obligatory on the part of the hospital to provide her proper safety during the indoor treatment,"" observed NHRC.

NHRC termed the incident ""lapse"" on the part of the hospital authorities.

""It is necessary for the employer authorities to check the credentials of the workers, who are being debuted in sensitive areas. Due to lapse on the part of the hospital authorities, the victim girl was victimised by the accused employee,"" said NHRC.

""The shameful incident occurring at a government-run facility raises a question mark on the safety of the patients, particularly the female patients in the hospital,"" it added.

On December 27, according to reports, a 39-year-old contract worker was sweeping and arranging a ward. The victim was lying on the bed in the same room. Her one hand had been tied to the bed to prevent the saline drip from falling out during a seizure.

The accused allegedly tied the other hand of the patient to the bed and started touching her inappropriately when another patient in the room alerted the staff.

The Medical Superintendent of the hospital has reportedly stated that appropriate action has been taken and the contractor who deputed the accused on work in the hospital has been told to dismiss him.(ANI)"

According to a company executive, the miner has recently met the long-standing demand of executives to revise pay scales. Now, the firm has raised salaries of its 20,000-odd employees in the range of 35-37 per cent, taking it significantly higher than the average in the public sector.

For the entry-level executives, the pay scale was revised to Rs 40,000-1,40,000 per month from Rs 16,400-40,500, while the chairman's pay scale has been raised to Rs 2 lakh-3.7 lakh from Rs 80,000-1.25 lakh, as per reports. When asked if the company was mulling increasing the price of coal to offset the impact of the proposed salary hike, the company had earlier said there is no such consideration. Rather, the company is looking at various options like improving efficiency and productivity to contain the impact of the pay hikes.

Last year in October, CIL had signed a wage pact with its workers' unions for five years which, the PSU said, would have an estimated impact of Rs 5,667 crore annually on the miner. CIL has nearly three lakh employees and the wage agreement was due since July 2016. According to industry experts, the increase in coal prices was one of the ways to counterbalance the impact which the PSU incurred from rise in salaries of its non-executive staff last year.

However, the central unions at Coal India have been demanding more money. Four unions -- CITU, HMS, AITUC and INTUC -- have called for a two-day strike from January 8 demanding a minimum wage of Rs 18,000 per month for all employees, pension of at least Rs 3,000 per month, discontinuation of privatisation of PSUs, including CIL, equal salaries and benefits for contract workers and removal of ceiling for bonus, ESI, provident fund and gratuity. Although this strike is planned to be a national strike, a member of INTUC said they are in talks with CIL union members to ensure the strike is observed in Coal India as well."

Speaking on the occasion Oli said his government accords top priority to rebuild structures damaged and destroyed by the earthquake over three years ago.

He said the government is committed to making the capital Kathmandu beautiful, safe and healthy to attract more tourists to the country.

He called upon all stakeholders and the general public to join hands and cooperate for rebuilding national pride projects such as the Dharahara tower.

The tower being constructed in an area of 21,267 square metres would include a mini theatre hall, a museum, musical fountain, food court, stone water spouts, souvenir shops and parking facilities. Officials said the tower would be completed in two years time.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered filing of FIRs against the personal secretaries of three senior ministers following a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel purportedly showing the trio seeking bribes against favours, including transfers and contracts.

Taking cognisance of the news report based on the sting, Adityanath has ordered for immediate suspension of the three government staff and institution of a special investigation team (SIT) under additional director general of police (ADG) Lucknow zone, Rajeev Krishna, to probe the matter. Inspector general of police (IGP) of special task force (STF) and senior vigilance bureau department would also be part of the SIT.

The SIT would complete the probe and submit a report within 10 days to the government for further action after recording statements of all the concerned parties. Besides, the state secretariat administration would review similar cases as well so as to pre-empt such incidents in future.

The CM had on earlier occasions issued directives for ensuring transparency and fair play in government procedures. He has stressed zero tolerance by the government towards corruption cases and that prompt action would be taken if there is any complaint from any quarters. However, the sting operation has nonetheless caused massive embarrassment to the government.

The sting showed the personal secretaries of UP backward welfare minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, mnister of state for mining Archana Pandey and minister of state for basic education Sandeep Singh seeking monetary favours for facilitating contracts or transfers.

According to sources, the government would take sternest action in these matter if the accused are found guilty of graft charges so as to deter other government employees from indulging in corrupt practices, especially with the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha poll months away.

In the sting, the personal secretary of Rajbhar is shown allegedly seeking Rs 4 million for a transfer. Besides, there are recordings of the secretariat staff allegedly assuring the sting reporter, posing as a contractor, that a contract for school bag and uniform, would be manipulated by networking with the kin of other state minister. However, Rajbhar has washed his hands of the controversy saying he had nothing to do with the alleged deal and in fact asked his departmental head to probe the matter.

In another news report, the secretary of minister Archana Pandey is shown striking a deal with the sting reporter for getting mining contracts in several districts. Meanwhile, she has also recommended strict action against her staff if found guilty after the probe.

The personal secretary of Sandeep Singh, who is the grandson of Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh, is purportedly shown tying to fix a deal pertaining to a hypothetical contract of supplying books and seeking his share."

The sandpaper episode in South Africa forced Australian cricket to reflect on the pitfalls of its ultra-aggressive on-field culture. It went on to cost them financially and sent two of their biggest names, David Warner and Steve Smith, into a year-long banishment.

If this controversy was not enough, Team India skipper Virat Kohli continued to attract the spotlight - not just for his stupendous achievements on the field, but for his faux pas off it.

The internal mess in BCCI continued as the members of Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA), currently governing the board, got busy slinging mud at each other. And then there was that clash in Indian women's cricket. More of it later.

First, we begin -- as talk around cricket these days begins -- with that man: Virat Kohli...

Virat Kohli snapping at the media

India's loss in the three-Test series in South Africa in January this year saw the media get a taste of Kohli's in-your-face aggression. After his team lost the second Test by 135 runs in Centurion, the Indian skipper blasted a scribe for asking questions on the playing XI.

This did not stop India's 1-2 defeat from being attributed to the way Kohli kept out his deputy Ajinkya Rahane from the first two games. The skipper also copped a fair bit of stick for playing Ishant Sharma ahead of Bhuvaneswar Kumar (India's standout performer in the first Test at Cape Town) in the second Test.

No sandpapering the Australian duplicity in South Africa

Australian cricket plumbed to a new low during the team's 1-3 Test series loss in South Africa in March.

During the third day of the third Test, Aussie opener Cameron Bancroft was seen rubbing the ball with a yellow object and then hiding it in his trousers. Confronted by the umpires, he showed them a sunglass pouch. After inspecting the ball, the umpires decided to carry on with the game.

Later in the press conference, both Bancroft and Aussie skipper Steve Smith admitted that they had tried to alter the ball's condition with yellow adhesive tape. Later it turned out that it was not a tape, but sandpaper, used to maintain bats. Cricket Australia launched an investigation and found Smith, Bancroft and opener David Warner guilty.

Both Smith and Warner received twelve-month international bans, while Bancroft was handed a nine-month punishment. Smith and Warner were also kept out of IPL 2018 and are currently playing domestic cricket in New South Wales.

Coach Darren Lehman stepped down after the series and Justin Langer went on to replace his former teammate. Senior players Aaron Finch and Tim Paine were handed over the leadership responsibilities in the shorter and longer formats.

Yo-yo! Bhuvneshwar Kumar's botched fitness report hurts India in England

The yo-yo fitness test came a cropper during Kohli and co.'s England tour in July.

Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who was facing a recurring back niggle since the South Africa tour, was rested from the Nidahas Trophy T-20 tri-series in Sri Lanka, 12 IPL matches and the Afghanistan Test at Bengaluru. He got selected for India's limited-overs leg after passing the yo-yo test.

During the third ODI against England in Leeds, Bhuvi faced the same lower-back issue again and bowled only seven overs. India not only lost the ODI series, but also paid a bigger price as the pacer missed the entire five-Test series. Kumar's absence weakened the Indian bowling line-up as they didn't have a genuine swing bowler.

Ravi Shastri talks down previous Indian teams

After India lost the five-Test series in England by a 1-4 margin, coach Ravi Shastri made a controversial statement that the Virat Kohli-led side is the best travelling unit in the last 15-20 years.The comment didn't go down well with experts and the BCCI.

Shastri's former teammate and legendary Indian batsman Sunil Gavaskar reminded the India coach that previous teams had put up brilliant shows outside Asia. The BCCI Committee of Administrators, for their part, reminded Shastri that it's up to the fans to judge which team was the best India has produced.

Kohli questions fan's loyalty

While celebrating his 30th birthday, Team India skipper Virat Kohli recorded a promotional video for his newly launched Official app. During this shoot, he came across a fan's tweet that said, ""He (Kohli) is an overrated batsman. Nothing seems special in his batting. I enjoy watching English and Australian batsman more than these Indians.""

Kohli lost little time in asking the fan to leave India. His reaction didn't go down well with the Twitterati, and some of them quickly highlighted Kohli's self-introductory video during the 2008 Under-19 World Cup, where he was seen naming former South African batsman Herschelle Gibbs as his favourite cricketer.

After the online backlash, the Indian skipper responded saying he was all for ""freedom of choice"" and urged fans to take the whole matter lightly.

The Mithali Raj-Romesh Powar clash

India made it in the semi-final of the 2018 ICC Women's World T20 in West Indies. But after comprehensively beating powerhouses like Australia and New Zealand in the first round, they got outplayed by England in the semis.

After the tournament, skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and her deputy Smriti Mandhana called for interim coach Ramesh Powar's re-appointment. The former India cricketer's three-month contract had ended on November 30.

But that did not happen as a series of emails from senior most cricketer Mithali Raj and Powar to the BCCI blaming each other took centre stage.

Mithali struck out against Powar writing that she only came to know about her exclusion from the playing XI for the semis, despite being fully fit and in form (she scored two fifties in group games against Pakistan and Ireland), after the toss.

Powar in return alleged that the veteran India cricketer was playing only for individual records. The coach added that Mithali didn't give proper inputs during team meetings. He, however, admitted that the relationship between him and Mithali wasn't cordial.

Apart from accusing Powar, Mithali also pointed the finger of blame at former India cricketer and current BCCI CoA member Diana Edulji accusing her of misusing her power to shield the entire coaching staff.

#MeToo controversy hits BCCI

During the height of the #MeToo campaign, BCCI CEO Rahul Johri too got named by an anonymous Twitter user, who accused him of misbehaving with a woman journalist before joining the board.

The BCCI immediately sought an explanation from Johri. CoA chief Vinod Rai set up a three-member panel to examine the charges against the BCCI CEO, while his colleague Diana Edulji strongly pitched for Johri's removal.

The panel surprised everyone by laying down deposition rules, as those willing to appear were asked to establish their stance and how they were connected in the whole matter. Johri eventually got cleared in November and resumed his office.

Clash between Diana Edulji and Vinod Rai gets bigger

While the Johri episode triggered the first clash between BCCI CoA members Vinod Rai and Diana Edulji, the fallout spilled over into the hiring of the women's team coach.

In a letter to Rai, Edulji called for the whole process to be scrapped telling Rai that Ramesh Powar be allowed to continue during the 2019 New Zealand tour, as the former India offie had the backing of T20 skipper Harmanpreet Kaur and her deputy Smriti Mandhana. Rai, however, ignored her request.

This angered Edulji and she asked BCCI office-bearers and senior employees to not follow Rai's instructions unless she endorsed it. She also questioned the move to set up an ad hoc committee consisting of Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad and Shantha Rangaswamy to select the coach.

Edulji blames Kohli for Kumble's exit as Team India coach

Edulji hit the headlines again as she raised the controversial exit of legendary leg-spinner Anil Kumble in 2017. In a leaked email, she suggested that captain Virat Kohli had frequently worked against Kumble. In the mail addressed to Vinod Rai, she also accused Kohli of frequently sending messages to the BCCI CEO Rahul Johri.

""Mr Kumble, a legend in his own right, was subjected to loss of face and made to look like a villain. He was gracious enough to move on for which I respect him. There also, rules were broken and I had raised objections back then,"" she wrote.

Kumble, who helped India reclaim the number one Test ranking during the 2016/17 home season, quit his post immediately after the defeat against Pakistan in last year's Champions Trophy final in UK.

He was replaced by former India cricketer and commentator Ravi Shastri, who was the interim Team India manager during 2014-16. Shastri is known for having a warm relationship with skipper Kohli.

Karun Nair selection controversy

Karnataka batsman Karun Nair, best known for his triple ton in his third-ever Test in the 2016/17 home season, got selected for the England tour earlier this year. However, he didn't get the opportunity to play there and went on to be omitted from the two-match Test series against West Indies at home during October too.

The middle-order batsman told media that neither the team management nor the selectors had let him know about his exclusion. Chief selector MSK Prasad, though, refuted the claims, saying that his colleague Devang Gandhi had spoken to Nair in England when he was not being picked in the playing XI."

""Now that the harvest is about to end, a forecast about a drop in output appears to have become true,"" said a second Dak Lak-based trader.

China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force last month tested the S-400 Triumf air defence system successfully shooting down a ""simulated ballistic target"" almost 250 kilometre away and moving at the supersonic speed of 3 kilometre per second, Hong-Kong based South China Morning Post reported on Thursday, quoting Russian media reports.

Details of the location of the test have not been disclosed.

India signed a USD 5 billion deal with Russia to buy the same system in October this year despite concerns over threat of sanctions under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) instituted by the US Congress on arms purchases from Russia.

India wants the long-range missile systems to tighten its air defence mechanism, particularly along the 3488 km-long Sino-India border.

S-400 is known as Russia's most advanced long-range surface-to-air missile defence system.

China was the first foreign buyer to seal a government-to-government deal with Russia in 2014 to procure the lethal missile system. Moscow has already started delivery of an undisclosed number of the S-400 missile systems to Beijing.

Russia says the S-400 is a cutting-edge air defence system that can detect and shoot down targets including ballistic missiles, enemy jets and drones up to 600 kilometre away at an altitude between 10 metres and 27 kilometres.

The system can simultaneously shell 36 targets moving at a speed of up to 4,800 metres per second with 72 ground-to-air missiles.

Commenting on the China's first test, Beijing-based military expert Li Jie said the reports showed that Moscow wanted to underscore the relationship at a time when the US was at loggerheads with both Russia and China.

""Despite pressure from the US, the Russian military will increase its cooperation with the PLA in areas such as missiles, shipbuilding and other sectors,"" he said.

China and Russia have significantly boosted their military ties in the past decade as both the countries compete with the US for regional and global influence.

Song Zhongping, a Hong Kong-based military expert with a focus on the PLA, told the Post that the test was an ""advertisement"" by the Russian military to promote its S-400 system.

""But it's also clear that the PLA's Rocket Force is proficient in using the S-400 air defence system because they are already familiar with its predecessor, the S-300, which China has used since the '90s,"" Song said.

He said it was important to differentiate between ""simulated ballistic target"" and real hypersonic missiles.

""Hypersonic weapons boast features such as manoeuvrability gliding, for example and they are almost impossible to intercept because they are travelling at such high speed,"" Song said.

Hazard scored his 100th and 101st Chelsea goals as Maurizio Sarri's men moved back into the Premier League top four by grinding out a 2-1 win at Watford on Boxing Day.

However, doubts remain over the Belgian's future with his contract set to expire in 2020 and persistent rumours over interest from European champions Real Madrid.

""It means a lot, especially because we won today also,"" said Hazard on reaching his Chelsea century.

""100th and 101st goal with this amazing club is something I will never forget, but now the fans, me, the staff, the players, we want more.

""I want to score more goals for this club and be a legend like Lampard, Terry or Drogba.""

Two of the three goals came in first-half stoppage time as Hazard's opener was quickly cancelled out by Roberto Pereyra's spectacular strike.

However, Hazard made sure he was the match-winner as he was brought down by Ben Foster and then converted the resulting spot-kick early in the second half to move Chelsea two points ahead of Arsenal in the battle for Champions League qualification.

Despite fuming at Chelsea's lack of focus in losing at Stamford Bridge for the first time in charge of the Blues to Leicester on Saturday, Sarri named the same starting line-up with Hazard again serving as the focal point of the attack ahead of Olivier Giroud and Alvaro Morata.

""Hazard can play in every position,"" said Sarri. ""Today he played very well with two goals and could have had a two or three assists.""

Chelsea's top scorer had to wait for his chances to come, but showed why Sarri persists with him through the middle as he coolly rounded Foster from Matteo Kovacic's pass to give Chelsea the lead.

Watford were level within two minutes as Jose Holebas's corner perfectly picked out Pereyra on the edge of the Chelsea box and the Argentine connected sweetly on the volley to find the bottom corner.

The hosts had claims for a penalty waved away when Gerard Deulofeu tumbled under a shoulder barge from David Luiz, but there was no controversy when at the other end moments later Hazard was hauled down by Foster.

Hazard picked himself up to dispatch the penalty confidently and by the end Chelsea's margin of victory should have been greater.

Indigo Seaways Chairman and Managing Director Chetan Contractor told reporters: ""It is not feasible to run a scheduled ferry service in absolutely unreliable high tides, so it is a must that continuous dredging is taken up in the region.""

""If this is not done, there is no point running an erratic service completely dependent on high tides,"" the contractor said. His company is also learnt to have conveyed this to the Prime Minister's Office (PMO).

""The services have become unreliable because of the erratic high tides. We can't ask the passengers to come at different times everyday. The passengers too have commitments to maintain,"" he asserted.

""Alternative arrangements have been made and the dredging work will start in a couple of days,"" Mukesh Kumar added.

According to him, the ferry service is functional and will remain so. ""You must understand this service has started only a couple of months ago and facing some teething problems. The high tides in this region are considered to be the second-worst in the world and so this happens sometimes.""

Reliable official sources said various feasibility studies, which were carried out prior to the Narendra Modi Government in Gujarat, had suggested that the seawaters in the Gulf of Khambhat were extremely turbulent and running any sort of ferry would not be possible.

Despite that the project was taken up and last year the ferry services were inaugurated by the Prime Minister. Indigo Seaways was awarded the contract to run this services. But since its start, the service has never been regular because of the weather and technical glitches.

Sources said for a successful ferry service to operate, there should be at least five-meter depth underneath the sea vessel at the terminal. But as the waters in the Gulf of Khambhat, through which the ferry service is run, are extremely turbulent, the sea constantly deposits silt at the banks, making dredging a constant process, thus making it an expensive proposition.

Knowledge and skills play an important role in the growth and development of the world. And it has been time and again emphasized by our state political leaders also that our children must receive education and must be able to engage with the world.

They say that we are caught in a big situation and its complexities are nowhere near a solution and education is one sector that can enable us to navigate the storm. Nothing else will.

The Honorable Governor Satya Pal Malik recently stated that the youth of the state hold key to Kashmir solution as they are ""very positive, talented and performing well in every field"". Sir, what about the field of education, where a big number is in stagnation with the infamous tag of contractual?

In October 2016, in an open letter by the then Education Minister Naeem Akhtar Saheb to Syed Ali Shah Geelani Saheb, states that the education should be kept out of any discord, not just given the reason from the common sense and the cumulative wisdom of human race but also from the fact of Prophet's (SAW) organizing teaching classes of his Muslim companions in the immediate aftermath of the battle of Badr.

Here, I am also repeating for the readers (especially those who referred to this to support their stand on education, that is, the state administration-past as well as present) that the non-believing Meccan prisoners who could read and write were released just for teaching the Muslims, who would obviously not be teaching them Islam.

Naeem Akhtar Saheb emphasized that education is the one thing that we need for political, economic and social empowerment. Further stating that mankind is yet to invent an alternative to this.

In the context of that letter, my question (to the state administration and the management) is what is the plight of the people who impart the knowledge in the educational institutions of our state?

As we emphasize implementing our Prophet's (SAW) command that seeking knowledge is the duty of every Muslim man and woman. Can we with our continued discrimination and exploitation against this vital human resource face Prophet (SAW) on the day of reckoning? These empowerment institutions also practice the system of injustice, discrimination, and exploitation that too with the torch bearers of the knowledge.

Experts explain that the competitive advantage of the higher education doesn't necessarily lie in the product and services that are offered by the institution, but in the employees of the institution who are managed through the human resource department.

Experts understand Human Resource Management to be the performance of all managerial functions in planning for, recruiting, selecting, developing, utilizing, rewarding as well as maximizing the potential of the human resources in an organization.

This is a specialized management task, which includes two main areas, namely human resource provision that is, acquiring employees and human resource retention that is, keeping employees.

According to the experts, the human resource function of an organization such as higher educational institutions requires constant and proper planning, because the number of personnel cannot be increased and decreased at random.

Further, stating that provisions can be made for changing circumstances by careful planning and consideration. So it must be the proactive management of people. It requires thinking ahead, and planning ways for an institution to better meet the needs of its employees, and for the employees to better meet the needs of the institution.

Higher Educational Institutions needs to recruit quality, competent staff in order to achieve the set goals.

Experts argue that staff recruitment must be seen as a form of business competition that is fiercely competitive, as organizations must compete to identify, attract and employ the most qualified and suitable persons, as this will allow the organization to deliver the best service, just as organizations compete and to develop and manufacture the best product.

The Business Dictionary defines recruitment as the process of identifying and recruiting the best-qualified candidate (from within or outside of an organization) for a job vacancy, in a most timely and cost effective manner.

The effectiveness of the Higher Educational Institutions depends on the effectiveness of the employees. An organization without high-power employees is destined to perform with mediocrity. In the case of Higher Educational Institutions it is very important to take the amount of practical experience (either in terms of research or teaching) that a lecturer needs into consideration, as an experienced person can add a lot of expertise to the mostly theoretical academic environment.

The organization's recruitment policy must reflect the diversity issues. There must be opportunities for the new comers but not at the cost of the old.

In our context, given the rising unemployment, the lack of alternatives and the rampant corruption among other factors, most of the highly qualified and competent candidates end up as contractual lecturers. The employment of fixed-term contract lecturers is a numerically significant part of the labour market in Higher Education.

According to the UK Higher Education Academy (2010), fixed-term contract lecturers (here infamously known as contractual lecturers) add value to the student learning experience as they have added practice-related experience, which is necessary in combining the theoretical with the practical side of the curriculum, and that the fixed-term lecturers are indispensible in the successful running of a complex educational and practice relevant operation.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are often more willing to learn new concepts as they hope that the additional knowledge and skills may give them an advantage when there is any opportunity for a permanent position.

According to an international study conducted by Tuckman during 1970's, many different individuals from various backgrounds are found to be interested in this staffing option at higher educational institutions, because lecturing adds to their professional as well as personal lives.

However, in our context these lecturers often express negative experiences that they are going through at the higher educational institutions, imparting knowledge but lacking in prestige.

Researchers explain that the ongoing trend in higher education institutions is the increasing dependence on fixed-term contract lecturers to lecture.

These lecturers frequently have the same amount of work but without benefits of additional training, encouragement or the sense to develop him-self or her-self. In our context these lecturers are not even considered as employees and at some institutions they are not even provided with suitable work space.

Fixed-term contract lecturers often experience a lack of support from the higher educational institutions that employ them. The management is unable to assist these staff members adequately.

Whereas, the state administration and the institutional management should not overlook the negative effects of their approach and practices because it has a negative influence on the stability of the higher educational institutions and the society at large.

Researchers are of the opinion that, although fixed-term lecturers can be a major asset to the higher educational institutions, this has gone unnoticed by these institutions.

Subsequently, these employees often feel like second-class citizens in the eyes of the administrators and the permanent contract academics.

These lower-paid employees are frequently denied regularity and predictability of employment. This, in turn, impacts negatively on employees with family responsibilities. These employees are often frustrated by the uncollegial and unprofessional treatment displayed towards them by fellow colleagues. The salaries received by these lecturers are much less than those received by their permanent counterparts.

Fixed-term contract staff is faced with limited, time-specific contracts that do not provide the benefit of a long term commitment from the administration and the higher educational institutions. All of these employees would prefer a permanent position, but, as these positions are very limited and they are faced with financial obligations, so these employees are forced to take fixed-term employment contacts.

The higher educational institutions expect a lower research and teaching output from their fixed-term lecturers.

Furthermore, fixed-term academics occupy lowest positions (infact lower than the IV-grade permanent non-teaching employee) regardless of their qualifications, experience and teaching in these institutions.

These lecturers are often vulnerable to exploitation, as they have no guarantees of continued employment, have no benefits, don't have developmental opportunities like permanent contract employees, and most important they possess no voice in the decision-making process that involve them, neither at the administrative level nor at the management level.

At the management level the condition is so worse that the management can't even afford the library facilities to these lecturers as provided to the permanent contract employees.

In some institutions the working hours are different, rigid for fixed-term contract employees whereas flexible for permanent contract employees upto the extent that the biometric attendance at departure is compulsory and specific for fixed-term contract employees only.

Fixed-term contract lecturers are concerned with the job insecurity, level of autonomy that they have, as well as the lack of freedom to make decisions regarding content of the courses, their salaries, lack of benefits, as well as how they are perceived by the students and their peers. Poor communication with the state authorities, authoritarian management structures and an overall indifferent and inefficient management structure has demoralized them.

In this context, fixed-term contract teaching jobs can be portrayed as work characterized by demoralization and demonization of the vital human resource that too even at the highest seat of learning."

The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company toward ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions.""

""We expects profit margins of domestic tea planters to contract by 140-170 basis points (bps) in FY 19 and a further by around 100 bps in FY20. The margins of integrated players are expected to contract 200-240 bps and a further around 90 bps, Crisil said in a report.

It expects prices at tea auctions across the country to close calendar year 2018 at Rs 145-146 per kg on average, 3-4 per cent higher on-year, compared with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 1.4 per cent logged over calendar 2012-2017.

""Despite this, the players' margins are expected to be impacted adversely as the export-driven uptick would not be enough to offset a significant increase in labour cost,"" it said.

In March 2018, tea estate workers' wages increased significantly by 22-25 per cent in north India, which accounts for approximately 80 per cent of the country's total tea production, Crisil noted, adding that labourers in Assam have demanded a further hike of Rs 17 per day (another 10 per cent), which is being discussed and, if implemented, would add to the burden of planters.

The rating agency observed that the domestic market is saturated, with penetration as high as 99 per cent among the tea-drinking population, which has limited growth potential and increased the players' dependence on exports to maintain the overall demand-supply balance in the domestic market and thereby prices.

The agency expects record tea production of 1,328 million kg in 2018 and 1,339 million kg in 2019, driven by higher yields in Assam and West Bengal.

""However, the share of exports is estimated to continue at 18-20 per cent in volume terms. Thus, healthy supplies due to higher production and limited scope for growth in domestic consumption and exports will cap any rise in prices for Indian players,"" it said.

In 2017, India accounted for 23 per cent of the global production. However, its share of exports was only 13 per cent due to stiff competition from Kenya and Sri Lanka, and high domestic consumption.

Both Kenya and Sri Lanka accounted for only 13 per cent of global tea production, but cornered 39 per cent exports share during the year. Those two countries also enjoy much higher realisation compared with India, given better-quality tea.

""Export realisation of Indian tea producer's dropped at around 2 per cent CAGR over 2012-2017. In 2018, growth in realisation is expected to have remained muted, though 2019 could see a marginal increase of 1-2 per cent,"" it said.

"159","1026834010","2018-12-26","https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/special-report-oil-output-goes-awol-in-venezuela-as-soldiers-run-pdvsa-1730769","Special Report: Oil output goes AWOL in Venezuela as soldiers run PDVSA","investing.com",FALSE,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Last July 6, Major General Manuel Quevedo joined his wife, a Catholic priest and a gathering of oil workers in prayer in a conference room at the headquarters of Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA.

The career military officer, who for the past year has been boss at the troubled state-owned oil company, was at no ordinary mass. The gathering, rather, was a ceremony at which he and other senior oil ministry officials asked God to boost oil output.

""This place of peace and spirituality,"" read a release by the Oil Ministry that was later scrubbed from its web site, ""was the site of prayer by workers for the recovery of production of the industry.""

President Nicolas Maduro turned heads in November 2017 when he named a National Guard general with no oil experience to lead PDVSA [PDVSA.UL]. Quevedo's actions since have raised even more doubts that he and the other military brass now running the company have a viable plan to rescue it from crushing debt, an exodus of workers and withering production now at its lowest in almost seven decades.

Aside from beseeching heaven, Quevedo in recent months has enacted a series of controversial measures that oil industry experts, PDVSA employees and contractors, and even everyday citizens say are pushing the once-profitable and respected company towards ruin.

Soldiers with AK-47s, under orders to prevent cheating on manifests, now board tankers to accompany cargo inspectors, rattling foreign captains and crews.

Workers who make mistakes operating increasingly dilapidated PDVSA equipment now face the risk of arrest and charges of sabotage or corruption. Military chieftains, moonlighting in the private sector, are elbowing past other contractors for lucrative service and supply business with PDVSA.

In a little-noted reversal of the Socialist government's two-decade drive to nationalize the industry, the lack of expertise among military managers is leading PDVSA to hire outsiders to keep afloat even basic operations, like drilling and pumping oil. To the dismay of many familiar with Venezuela's oil industry, some of the contracts are going to small, little-known firms with no experience in the sector.

Combined, industry veterans say, the steps leave Venezuela's most important company - which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue - with even fewer means to rebuild the nation's coffers, pay its many creditors and regain self-sufficiency as an oil producer.

""What we are witnessing is a policy of destroying the oil industry,"" said Jose Bodas, general secretary of the Oil Workers Federation, a national labor union. ""The military officials don't listen to workers. They want to give orders, but they don't understand this complicated work.""

Maduro defends the military managers, arguing they are more in synch with his Socialist worldview than capitalist industry professionals who exploit the country for personal profit. ""I want a Socialist PDVSA,"" the president told allied legislators earlier this year. ""An ethical, sovereign and productive PDVSA. We must break this model of the rentier oil company.""

Quevedo, who holds the title of oil minister as well as president of PDVSA, didn't respond to requests for comment for this story. Neither Venezuela's Information Ministry, responsible for communications for the government and senior officials, nor PDVSA's press office returned phone calls or emails from Reuters.

PDVSA and the Oil Ministry disclose scant information about Quevedo, who is 51, according to his social security registration. He seldom makes public speeches. But at an industry event in Vienna last June, Quevedo told journalists PDVSA is aware of its challenges and hoped within months to make up for plummeting output.

""We hope by year end to recover the lost production,"" he said in a forecast that has been missed. ""We have the capacity and we have summoned the strength of the workers.""

Nearly 20 years after the late Hugo Chavez launched his ""Bolivarian revolution,"" much of Venezuela is in tatters. Food and medicines are scarce, hyperinflation has gutted purchasing power for increasingly desperate citizens and roughly three million Venezuelans have fled the country in search of a better life.

At PDVSA, managers long sought to keep the company running, even if the economic meltdown and falling oil prices meant they had fewer resources to invest in exploration, growth and basic maintenance. Despite their efforts, decay led to dwindling production, deteriorating facilities and a progressive loss of skilled workers.

Now, critics say, military officials atop PDVSA have put aside any pretense of running it like a proper business, doing little to stem the fall in production or improve the company's financial, operational and staffing problems.

A PURGE

No matter the dysfunction, PDVSA remains a rare and crucial source of foreign currency in the enfeebled Andean country. For Maduro, who became president after Chavez died in 2013, handing the company over to the military is seen by many as a calculated move to buy loyalty from officers.

""No one will be able to remove the military from PDVSA now,"" said Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister. Ramirez ran the company for a decade under Chavez before clashing with Maduro, who accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. ""PDVSA is a barrack.""

PDVSA is struggling to fulfill supply contracts with buyers, including major creditors from China and Russia who have already advanced billions of dollars in payments in exchange for oil. Last month, the head of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, flew to Venezuela and complained to Maduro about the delays, Reuters reported.

Demand remains healthy for Venezuelan oil. Operational problems under Quevedo, however, have caused production to drop 20 percent to 1.46 million barrels per day, according to the latest figures Caracas reported to OPEC, the oil cartel, of which it is a member.

Quevedo in January will assume OPEC's rotating presidency for one year. PDVSA's financial problems are likely to demand much of his attention.

The gross value of PDVSA's oil exports is expected to fall to $20.9 billion this year compared with $24.9 billion last year, according to a calculation provided to Reuters by the International Energy Center at IESA, a Venezuelan business school. Exports a decade ago were over four times as much, reaching $89 billion, according to PDVSA's accounts for 2008.

PDVSA didn't publish a 2017 report and hasn't released financial results in 2018.

Little has been publicly disclosed by PDVSA or Maduro's government about the military transformation within its ranks.

A Reuters examination based on confidential PDVSA documents - as well as interviews with dozens of current and former employees, shippers, traders, foreign oil executives and others who do business with the company - shows how Quevedo's National Guard is seeping into every facet of its operations. The documents include employment records, agreements with contractors and internal staff memos.

Quevedo has appointed more than 100 aides and advisors from the military and from a previous post as a government minister to senior positions, according to a person familiar with PDVSA's human resource records.

At its shabby concrete Caracas headquarters, once brimming with suited executives, military officers are now in charge of operations. Workers say offices in Quevedo's penthouse sanctum remain luxurious. But in the run-down halls below, socialist propaganda, including portraits of Fidel Castro and Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, is among the scant decor left on the walls.

The shift toward military management was the result of a purge of PDVSA leadership.

Allegations of corruption have been rife across the Venezuelan government in recent years; Maduro himself is the target of U.S. sanctions for graft and human rights violations, which he denies.

In 2017, the president leveled his own accusations against PDVSA, describing it as a den of ""thieves."" He accused many former executives of skimming from contracts and laundering money and argued that their graft worsened the country's crisis.

He ordered the arrest of dozens of top managers, including PDVSA's two previous presidents, chemist Nelson Martinez and engineer Eulogio Del Pino. Martinez died at a military hospital earlier this month, suffering a heart attack while undergoing kidney dialysis, two people familiar with the circumstances said.

Del Pino remains detained, awaiting trial. Reuters was unable to reach his lawyers for comment. A person familiar with Del Pino's defense said he has yet, after a year in jail, to have an initial court hearing.

LOYALIST

At the time of the purge, Quevedo had risen from the National Guard ranks to become a prominent government loyalist.

Quevedo's Twitter profile often features a photo of the general, a stocky and balding man with heavy eyebrows, reviewing paperwork with the president or smiling happily alongside him. His feed consists almost exclusively of retweets of Maduro's posts.

Since 2001, the general has moved between military and civilian positions. He has a longstanding relationship with Diosdado Cabello, the powerful vice president of the Socialist party: The two were classmates as young men at military school.

Those ties led to senior posts for Quevedo at the Defense Ministry and a program created by Chavez for low-income housing, according to official government gazettes and people who know his trajectory.

In 2014, back in a command role with the National Guard, Quevedo led a unit that clashed with demonstrators during protests that shook Venezuela for four months. At least 43 people, on both sides, died during the demonstrations, sparked by the onset of food shortages.

Quevedo was criticized by many government opponents for using excessive force, which he denied. He appeared frequently on state television at the time, donning an olive-green helmet and bullet-proof vest. ""These are terrorist groups,"" he said of the protestors, who eventually dissipated, leading him to declare that ""the coup has been defeated.""

Pleased with Quevedo's performance, Maduro in 2015 named him housing minister. In his two years in the post, he again became a fixture on state television, often wearing the red shirt of the Socialist movement and praising Maduro's ""humane"" housing policies.

Opposition leaders scoffed at what they saw as Quevedo's outsized boasts, including an unsubstantiated claim that the government constructed more than 2 million homes, despite widespread shortages of basic building materials. The housing ministry didn't respond to requests for comment.

In November 2017, intelligence agents arrested former PDVSA chief Del Pino in a predawn raid on unspecified graft charges. By then, Quevedo was Maduro's choice to lead the all-important company. The announcement prompted widespread skepticism in the industry.

Quevedo said he would need little time to get a handle on the oil businesses. ""Give me 10 days,"" he told acquaintances, according to one person who spoke with him at the time.

From the start, Maduro made clear the challenge ahead. In a public address during ""Powerhouse Venezuela 2018,"" a government conference meant to showcase business potential, the president ordered Quevedo to boost oil output by a whopping 1 million barrels per day - roughly a 50 percent increase at the time.

Over the past year, though, Quevedo has failed to reverse the slide.

One of his first challenges, according to people within PDVSA, was to stanch the flow of workers, many of whom deserted the company and Venezuela altogether. PDVSA hasn't disclosed recent employment figures. But estimates by IPD Latin America, an oil and gas consultancy, indicate PDVSA has about 106,000 workers - 27 percent fewer than in 2016.

Because of cost-of-living increases that now top 1 million percent per year, according to Venezuela's National Assembly, PDVSA salaries have crumbled to the equivalent of a handful of dollars a month for most workers.

With no money, and little real work to do at idle and faulty facilities, some employees only show up to eat at the few company cafeterias that remain open. Shippers told Reuters that PDVSA workers at times board vessels to ask for food.

""MALICE""

To boost manpower, Quevedo has been staffing some jobs, including posts that once required technical knowledge, with National Guard recruits. The terminal of Jose, a Caribbean port in northeast Venezuela, is one of the few remaining facilities from which PDVSA exports crude oil.

The changes are disturbing buyers here. Some tanker captains complain that young soldiers are woefully unprepared to verify technical details, like whether crude density, a crucial attribute of quality, complies with contract specifications, according to three shippers and one PDVSA employee.

Crews fret a stray bullet from the soldiers' rifles could spark fires and complain that some of the crime afflicting the country is making its way on board. Although Quevedo has tasked the soldiers to help spot graft, some of the low-paid recruits ask for bribes themselves, shippers said, for signing off on paperwork or completing inspections.

""There are many risks,"" one captain told Reuters.

Venezuela's Defense Ministry, which oversees the National Guard, didn't respond to Reuters phone calls or emails requesting comment.

Even with soldiers as substitutes, PDVSA can't find the workers it needs to man many posts. From the processing of crude at refineries to contract negotiations with buyers, the shortage of skilled staffers is hobbling the company.

In a recent internal report, PDV Marina, the company's maritime unit, said staffing was in a ""critical state"" on PDVSA's own tankers, forcing some workers to toil far more than allowed by union rules. The ""alarming deficit of main staff,"" the report read, means ""we cannot honor labor agreements.""

Tensions with military managers are causing even more departures, some workers say.

Consider an incident in June, when two tankers docked at Jose. One prepared to take on heavy crude, the other a lighter grade of oil.

As the tankers loaded, PDVSA port employees noticed a mixup - the two crudes had blended. The mistake, the government said later, forced PDVSA to pay the buyers, because of contractual penalties, $2.7 million.

It would also be costly for nine PDVSA employees.

Shortly after the error, soldiers and intelligence agents arrested the workers, and prosecutors charged them with sabotage. ""This was premeditated,"" said Tarek Saab, Maduro's chief prosecutor, announcing the arrests on television. ""The actions go beyond negligence - there was malice here.""

After three days in an overcrowded military jail, they were released, pending trial. Two workers in the oil industry familiar with their case said poor maintenance, not sabotage, caused the mishap. A faulty valve system, flimsy after years without upkeep, caused the fuels to mix, they said.

Six months later, the government has presented no evidence against the workers.

Reuters was unable to reach the accused or to independently determine the cause of the mishap. Colleagues said the workers are under orders not to speak publicly of the incident.

The arrests have rattled PDVSA employees, especially because soldiers and intelligence agents have also detained workers at other facilities after mistakes.

In July, four PDVSA employees were arrested after crude spilled into a river near an oilfield in the state of Monagas, according to workers and media accounts there. One worker in Monagas told Reuters that faulty turbines caused the spill and that a vehicle shortage kept employees from reaching the site to stem the flow.

""We don't understand how a lack of resources becomes an excuse to accuse workers of negligence or sabotage,"" he said. ""They're being asked to work without safety equipment, tools, even without being able to feed themselves or their families.""

Quevedo has been creating new partnerships that are meant to shore up PDVSA. In August, for instance, the general said the company was ""opening its doors"" for seven private companies to pursue unspecified ""service contracts"" across the country.

The move raised eyebrows here, because it ran counter to longstanding efforts to nationalize the entire industry. Chavez himself phased out similar contracts, arguing that they enriched private enterprise for work that the state should do itself.

According to a document seen by Reuters, the companies obtained six-year agreements to operate oilfields on behalf of PDVSA in return for boosting output, financing investments and procuring equipment.

But the companies are unfamiliar even to veterans of Venezuela's oil industry. None are recognized as having experience operating oilfields. Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Karina, one of those listed on the document, doesn't appear to have a web site. Reuters was unable to reach it or any of the others.

Critics of the arrangements, and government opponents, say the transactions aren't transparent. By keeping details from the public, they argue, the company faces little scrutiny over whom it chooses to do business with.

""PDVSA is looking to maintain its confederation of mafias, its quota of looting,"" said Jorge Millan, an opposition legislator who in September led a push in the National Assembly to denounce the contracts.

While Quevedo's militarization of PDVSA hasn't reversed the company's decline, the government shows few public signs of displeasure. In October, the government announced a PDVSA board shuffle. Among the changes: Jose Rojas, another National Guard general, replaced a civilian director.

Past executives joke that Quevedo knew what he was doing when he prayed for help.

""He's right,"" said Jose Toro Hardy, an economist who served on PDVSA's board of directors in the 1990s. ""A miracle is needed for an increase in these conditions."""

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

The Government has set a target of doubling of farmers' income by the year 2022. The Government has constituted an Inter-Ministerial Committee under the Chairmanship of Chief Executive Officer, National Rainfed Area Authority, Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare to examine issues relating to doubling of farmers' income and recommend a strategy to achieve doubling of farmers' income in real terms by the year 2022.

The committee has identified seven sources of income growth viz, improvement in crop and livestock productivity; resource use efficiency or savings in the cost of production; increase in the cropping intensity; diversification towards high value crops; improvement in real prices received by farmers; and shift from farm to non-farm occupations. The committee is also looking into the investments in and for agriculture e.g. increasing public investments for agriculture-rural roads, rural electricity, irrigation; the need for policy support to enable investments by corporate sector in agriculture.

The Government has been reorienting the agriculture sector by focusing on an income-centeredness which goes beyond achieving merely the targeted production. The income approach focuses on achieving high productivity, reduced cost of cultivation and remunerative price on the produce, with a view to earn higher profits from farming.

Several initiatives have already been taken among each of the above mention strategies which inter-alia include:

(i) Initiating market reforms through the State Governments by amending the agriculture marketing regime.

(ii) Encouraging contract farming through the State Governments by promulgating of Model Contract Farming Act.

(iii) 22,000 Gramin Haats are to be upgraded to work as centers of aggregation and for direct purchase of agricultural commodities from the farmers.

(iv) Launch of eNAM initiative to provide farmers an electronic online trading platform.

(v) Implementation of flagship scheme of distribution of Soil Health Cards to farmers so that the use of fertilizers can be optimized. So far more than 15 crore Soil Health Cards have been distributed in two cycles.

(vi) ""Per drop more crop"" initiative under which drip/sprinkler irrigation is being encouraged for optimal utilization of water.

(vii) ""Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)"" under which organic farming is being promoted. North East is being developed as organic hub.

(ix) Under ""Har Medh Par Ped"", agro forestry is being promoted for supplementing farm income, increase risk management and climate resilient agriculture as an important component of Integrated Farming Systems

(x) TheIndian Forest Act, 1927 was amended to exclude bamboo from the definition of 'trees'. Henceforth bamboo grown outside forest area will not be regulated under the provisions of felling and transit rules. As a corollary the restructured National Bamboo Mission was launched for development of the value chain of bamboo as a measure to strengthen rural economy by linking the producer (farmer) to markets (industry). (x) Launch of PM-Asha scheme which will ensure MSP to farmers for oilseeds, pulses and copra.

(xi) Minimum Support Price (MSP) is notified by the Government for certain crops. Giving a major boost for the farmers income, the Government has approved the increase in the MSPs for all Kharif & Rabi crops for 2018-19 season at a level of at least 150 percent of the cost of production.

(xii) Bee keeping has been promoted under Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH) to increase the productivity of crops through pollination and increase the honey production as an additional source of income of farmers.

Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) -Per Drop More Crop

Department of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare is implementing Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), which is operational from 2015-16 in the country. PMKSY (Per Drop More Crop) mainly focuses on water use efficiency at farm level through precision/micro irrigation. Besides promoting precision irrigation (Drip and Sprinkler Irrigation System) and better on-farm water management practices to optimize the use of available water resources, this component also supports micro level water storage or water conservation/management activities as Other Interventions(OI) to supplement source creation.

Micro Irrigation Fund

In order to achieve the objective of enhancing water use efficiency in agriculture sector and bring about desired growth, Finance Minister announced in the Union Budget for 2017-18 setting up of a dedicated fund in NABARD titled ""Micro Irrigation Fund"" (MIF) with initial corpus of Rs.5000 crores.

Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) in its meeting held on 16 May, 2018 approved a dedicated Micro Irrigation Fund created with NABARD with an initial corpus of Rs. 5000 crore (Rs. 2000 crore for 2018-19 & Rs. 3000 crore for 2019-20) for encouraging public and private investments in Micro irrigation.

The main objective of the fund is to facilitate the States in mobilizing the resources for expanding coverage of Micro Irrigation by taking up special and innovative projects and also for incentivizing micro irrigation beyond the provisions available under Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) to encourage farmers to install micro irrigation systems.

Rainfed Area Development Programme

Rainfed Area Development(RAD) programme under National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture(NMSA) focuses on Integrated Farming System (IFS) for enhancing productivity and minimizing risks associated with climatic variabilities. Under this system, crops/cropping system is integrated with activities like horticulture, livestock, fishery, agro-forestry, apiculture etc. to enable farmers to mitigate the impacts of drought, flood or other extreme weather events with the income opportunity from allied activities during crop damage.

Enhancing of Minimum Support Price- MSP declared at 150% of Cost of Production

The Union Budget for 2018-19 had announced the pre-determined principle to keep MSP at levels of one and half times the cost of production. Accordingly, Government has increased the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for all notified Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a return of at least 50 percent of cost of production for the season 2018-19. This decision of the Government was a historic one as it fulfills the commitment to the farmers to provide 50 per cent return over cost of production for the first time for all mandated crops. Details of MSP, cost and percent return over cost for 2017-18 and 2018-19 is given below:

Cost*, Minimum Support Price (MSP) & percent return over cost

(Rs. per quintal)

* Includes all paid out costs such as those incurred on account of hired human labour, bullock labour/machine labour, rent paid for leased in land, expenses incurred on use of material inputs like seeds, fertilizers, manures, irrigation charges, depreciation on implements and farm buildings, interest on working capital, diesel/electricity for operation of pump sets etc, miscellaneous expenses and imputed value of family labour.

Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA)

Cabinet approves New Umbrella Scheme ""Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan"" (PM-AASHA)

PM-AASHA will provide MSP assurance to farmers: A reflection of Government's commitment to the ""Annadata""

Giving a major boost to the pro-farmer initiatives of the Government and in keeping with its commitment and dedication for the Annadata, the Union Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has approved a new Umbrella Scheme ""Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay SanraksHan Abhiyan' (PM-AASHA). The Scheme is aimed at ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers for their produce as announced in the Union Budget for 2018.

This is an unprecedented step taken by Govt. of India to protect the farmers' income which is expected to go a long way towards the welfare of farmers. Government has already increased the MSP of kharif crops by following the principle of 1.5 times the cost of production. It is expected that the increase in MSP will be translated to farmer's income by way of robust procurement mechanism in coordination with the State Governments.

Components of PM-AASHA:

The new Umbrella Scheme includes the mechanism of ensuring remunerative prices to the farmers and is comprised of

The other existing schemes of Department of Food and Public Distribution (DFPD) for procurement of paddy, wheat and nutri-cereals/coarse grains and of Ministry of Textile for cotton and jute will be continued for providing MSP to farmers for these crops.

Cabinet has also decided that participation of private sector in procurement operation needs to piloted so that on the basis of learnings the ambit of private participation in procurement operations may be increased. Therefore, in addition to PDPS, it has been decided that for oilseeds, states have the option to roll out Private Procurement Stockist Scheme (PPSS) on pilot basis in selected district/APMC(s) of district involving the participation of private stockiest. The pilot district/selected APMC(s) of district will cover one or more crop of oilseeds for which MSP is notified. Since this is akin to PSS, in that it involves physical procurement of the notified commodity, it shall substitute PSS/PDPS in the pilot districts.

The selected private agency shall procure the commodity at MSP in the notified markets during the notified period from the registered farmers in consonance with the PPSS Guidelines, whenever the prices in the market fall below the notified MSP and whenever authorized by the state/UT government to enter the market and maximum service charges up to 15% of the notified MSP will be payable.

Expenditure:

The Cabinet has decided to give additional government guarantee of Rs.16,550 crore making it Rs. 45,550 crore in total.

In addition to this, budget provision for procurement operations has also been increased and Rs. 15,053 crore is sanctioned for PM-AASHA implementation. The scheme henceforth is a reflection of Government's commitment and dedication to our 'Annadata'.

Procurement over the years:

During financial years 2010-14 total procurement was Rs. 3500 crore only whereas during financial years 2014-18, it has risen 10 times and reached to Rs. 34,000 crore. For procurement of these agri-commodities during 2010-14, Government Guarantee of Rs. 2500 crore was provided with expenditure of only Rs. 300 crore; while during 2014-18, Guarantee amount has been increased to Rs. 29,000 crore with expenditure of Rs. 1,000 crore.

Details:

Government of India is working with the holistic approach of solving any issue rather than in fragments. Increasing MSP is not adequate and it is more important that farmers should get full benefit of the announced MSP. For this, government realizes that it is essential that if price of the agriculture produce market is less than MSP, then in that case State Government and Central Government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism. With this approach, Cabinet has approved the Umbrella Scheme of PM-AASHA with three sub-schemes i.e. Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS) and pilot of Private Procurement & Stockist Scheme (PDPS).

In Price Support Scheme (PSS), physical procurement of pulses, oilseeds and Copra will be done by Central Nodal Agencies with proactive role of State governments. It is also decided that in addition to NAFED, Food Cooperation of India (FCI) will take up PSS operations in states /districts. The procurement expenditure and losses due to procurement will be borne by Central Government as per norms.

Under Price Deficiency Payment Scheme this scheme (PDPS), it is proposed to cover all oilseeds for which MSP is notified. In this direct payment of the difference between the MSP and the selling/modal price will be made to pre-registered farmers selling his produce in the notified market yard through a transparent auction process. All payment will be done directly into registered bank account of the farmer. This scheme does not involve any physical procurement of crops as farmers are paid the difference between the MSP price and Sale/modal price on disposal in notified market. The support of central government for PDPS will be given as per norms.

Pro-farmer initiatives of the Government:

The Government is committed to realizing the vision of doubling farmers' income by 2022. The emphasis is on enhancing productivity, reducing cost of cultivation and strengthening post-harvesting management, including market structure. Several market reforms have been initiated. These include Model Agricultural Produce and Livestock Marketing Act, 2017 and Model Contract Farming and Services Act, 2018. Many States have taken steps to adopt these through legislation.

Efforts are on for a new market architecture, so as to ensure that farmers get remunerative prices on their produce. These include setting up of Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs) so as to promote 22,000 number of retail markets in close proximity of farm gate; competitive and transparent wholesale trade at APMC through eNAM and a robust and pro-farmer export policy.

Besides, several other pro-farmers' initiatives such as implementation of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana and distribution of Soil Health Cards have been undertaken. The commitment for farmer welfare is also reflected by unprecedented decision of announcing minimum support price based on the formula of 1.5 times the cost of cultivation.

Upgradation and development of rural haats as Gramin Agricultural Markets (GrAMs)

In order to optimize the use of scarce resources and mitigate the uncertainty in price and marketing, the Government has formulated and released a progressive and facilitative Model Act ""The ----State/ UT Agricultural Produce & Livestock Contract Farming and Services (Promotion & Facilitation) Act, 2018"" in May, 2018 for its adoption by the states/Union Territories (UTs). The aforesaid Model Contract Farming Act covers the entire value and supply chain from pre-production to post harvest marketing including services contract for the agricultural produce and livestock.

Based on the experience gained in implementation of the scheme over two years and with a view to ensure better transparency, accountability and timely payment of claims to the farmers, Government has comprehensively revised the Operational Guidelines of the scheme recently. These revised guidelines have come into effect from 1st October, 2018 i.e, from Rabi 2018-19 season. The brief features/changes in the revised OGs are as under:-

Provision of Penalties/Incentives for States, ICs and Banks i.e, 12% interest rate per annum to be paid by the Insurance Company to farmers for delay in settlement claims beyond 10 days of prescribed cut off date for payment of claims.

Similarly, State Government has to pay 12% interest rate for delay in release of State share of Subsidy beyond three months of prescribed cut off date/submission of requisition by Insurance Companies.

Rationalization of methodology for calculation of Threshold Yield (TY) - Moving average of best 5 out of 7 years for calculation of claim amount.

Increased time for change of crop name for insurance - upto 2 working days prior to cut-off date for enrolment instead of earlier provision of 1 month before cut off date.

More time to insured farmers to intimate individual claims - 72 hours (instead of 48 hours) through any stakeholders and directly on the portal.

Inclusion of hailstorm in post harvest losses, besides unseasonal and cyclonic rainfall.

Inclusion of cloud burst and natural fire in localized calamities in addition to hailstorm, landslide and inundation.

Detailed plan for publicity and awareness- earmarked expenditure - 0.5% of Gross premium per company per season.

Inclusion of Perennial horticultural crops (on pilot basis) under the ambit of PMFBY.

Use of Remote Sensing Technology (RST) in clustering/Risk classification.

The scheme is in its third year of implementation and the Department has put a rigorous monitoring mechanism in place in form of weekly Video Conferencing with all stakeholders including States, Insurance Companies, Banks and other supporting agencies, issues based meetings with concerned stake holders including meetings of Technical Advisory Committee and meetings of National Level Monitoring Committee (NLMC) to ensure early settlement of claims under the scheme.

Agricultural Credit

Agriculture is a dominant sector of our economy and credit plays an important role in increasing agriculture production. Availability and access to adequate, timely and low cost credit from institutional sources is of great importance especially to small and marginal farmers. Along with other inputs, credit is essential for establishing sustainable and profitable farming systems. Experience has shown that easy access to financial services at affordable cost positively affects the productivity, asset formation, and income and food security of the rural poor.

The Government of India has initiated several policy measures to improve the accessibility of farmers to the institutional sources of credit. The emphasis of these policies has been on progressive institutionalization for providing timely and adequate credit support to all farmers with particular focus on small and marginal farmers and weaker sections of society to enable them to adopt modern technology and improved agricultural practices for increasing agricultural production and productivity. These policy measures have resulted in significant increase in the share of institutional credit. Every year, the GoI in the Union Budget, announces the ground level credit target for agriculture which banks have to achieve during the financial year.

Banks have been consistently surpassing the annual target. The targets and achievement made in respect of agriculture credit flow for the last four years are as under:

To give higher thrust to capital formation in agriculture for improving production and productivity in agriculture sector, a sub target of 35% under Term loan, which works out to Rs.3,85,000 crore within the overall agriculture credit target of Rs.11,00,000/- crore has been fixed for the year 2018-19 and the Agency-wise, purpose-wise agriculture credit targets for 2018-19 is as under:-

With a view to ensuring availability of agriculture credit, the GoI had launched Interest Subvention scheme in the year 2006-07. As per the extant guidelines of GoI for the year 2017-18 and 2018-19, Interest Subvention of 2% per annum is provided to Public Sector Banks, Private Sector Banks (in respect of loans given by their rural and semi urban branches), Cooperative Banks and Regional Rural Banks on their own funds used for short term crop loans upto Rs.3,00,000/- per farmer provided the lending institutions make available short-term credit at the ground level at 7% per annum to farmers.

In addition to above, a scheme was introduced from 2009-10 for providing additional interest subvention to the prompt paying farmers wherein presently 3% Interest Subvention as an incentive to prompt payee farmers is given. This subvention is available to farmers on the short term production credit upto maximum amount of Rs.3.00 lakh availed during the year. Thus the prompt paying farmers are getting short term crop loans @4% per annum from various banks.

In order to discourage distress sale by farmers and to encourage them instead to store their produce in warehouses, the benefit of interest subvention will be available to small and marginal farmers having Kisan Credit Card for a further period of upto six months after the harvesting of the crop at the same rate as available to crop loan against Negotiable Warehouse Receipts issued for the produce stored in warehouses accredited with Warehousing Development Regulatory Authority.

To provide relief to farmers affected by natural calamities, an interest subvention of 2 per cent per annum will be made available to banks for the first year on the restructured loan amount. Such restructured loans will attract normal rate of interest from the second year onwards as per the policy laid down by the RBI. The details for budget allocation and expenditure under the scheme for the last three years and the current year are as under:

The Reserve Bank of India has put in place a mechanism to address situations arising out of natural calamities and has issued guidelines in the form of Master Directions to banks on 'Relief Measures by Banks in Areas affected by Natural Calamities'. These guidelines automatically come into force after the state/district authorities declare the calamity. The conveners are to ensure that District Consultative Committees (DCCs) and State Level Bankers' Committees (SLBCs) meeting are held at the earliest to evolve a coordinated action plan for implementation of the relief programme in collaboration with State/District Authorities. The banks' contribution in providing relief relates to rescheduling of existing loans and sanctioning of fresh loan. The precise details of credit assistance by the banks will depend on the requirements of the situation, their own operational capabilities and the actual needs of the borrowers.

The Bank has also developed a portal to capture data on natural calamities on real time basis.

Compulsive public interest litigator ML Sharma can be a pain. But he has on occasion and perhaps by accident been of service to the legal community and it is to be hoped that his Christmas-eve PIL against the MHA surveillance order is taken seriously by the Supreme Court.

The Indian government's charter to 10 security agencies to snoop on its own citizens is not only illegal and bad in law, it offends the senses. All six of them.

It is a malicious notification that should have been aborted at the very moment of conception. By this government and the previous one.

What is especially worrying, India's Intelligence Bureau, which tops the list of agencies authorised to snoop into the private communication of citizens, has no charter under Indian law post-independence.

That is a fact, not a claim.

The IB was born not long after the British East India company faced its first great revolt in 1857. Its mandate: to keep the colonial government ""fully informed of everything affecting the public peace and order, which can be be made the subject of observation.""

For those who don't remember, 1857 was bloody - over a 100,000 people died; it was widespread; it started in superstition but eventually spread across caste, class, and religion; and it lasted over a year.

It is known as India's first war of independence in which a Hindu soldier lit the fire and a Mughal emperor became the rallying figure behind whom everyone was prepared to unite.

The last fact and the brutality of the Siege of Cawnpore led the British empire to dissolve the East India Company and directly take over its colony by the Government of India Act of 1858.

India became an official Crown vassal state and the Queen appointed her first Secretary of State to India.

She also soon became ""Empress"" of India and her loyal servant, the Right Honourable Richard Asheton 1st Viscount Cross, came to be the 8th Secretary of State on August 3, 1886.

Unlike most of his predecessors who barely lasted months on the job, Cross would flourish in his new position. As Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli's home secretary for six years (1874 to 1880), he had been specifically chosen for this job.

Making India safe for Empire

Within six months of taking over, Cross wrote a letter, dated March 25, 1887, Secret Dispatch No 11, to the Viceroy's Camp in India.

He asked that a system be set up for ""collection of secret and political intelligence in India."" Specifically, any observation ""with particular reference to the expedience of employing especially qualified natives in those parts of the Empire, notably the Punjab and Hyderabad, which are exceptionally exposed to political intrigues or dangers.""

The Viceroy of India at the time was the much-traveled Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, also known as the first Marques of Dufferin.

He'd come from Egypt and Lebanon, would move from India to Canada, his end would be ignominiously ignoble as his mining company would dissolve in a cheating scandal, but he would remain forever beloved. A British Columbia island would be named after him.

On November 15, 1887, though, Dufferin wrote back to Cross saying he had come up with a scheme to collect Intelligence on the natives.

Dufferin enclosed copies of reports from two officers - Colonel Henderson and D.E. McCracken. The plan was two-fold, based on the kind of territories in India at the time.

(a) In British controlled provinces, Dufferin planned to use the services of the police force.

(b) In native ruled princely states, he planned to use ""the existing means at the disposal of Political Offices, for the collection of intelligence on political, social and religious movements¸ the nature of which is fully explained in the accompanying papers.""

Dufferin believed that Indians would object to the creation of a large British detective force stomping all over the place.

Besides, it would defeat the very purpose of stealth. His plan was to ask local governments to collect intelligence for their own purpose and report relevant information to the Government of India.

Dufferin planned to have the fewest possible of his own men at the local and central level to receive and analyse this information.

And where necessary to inquire and act on it.

Remarkably, this continues to be the Intelligence Bureau structure and mandate.

The IB today

To be entirely specific, the Intelligence Bureau's mandate is:

- To collect intelligence on political, social and religious movements in the country on behalf of the state. Translation : For the party in power at the centre. The subject group includes all politicians of all political parties, dissident political and non-political groups (violent or non-violent) and religious groups that the state wants to keep an eye on.

In today's English, the IB's formal and legal mandate is Oppo Research, Spying on Dissidents and Profiling.

How does it do that? A complicated structure of information gathering, evaluation and action have been in place for the last century.

The Central IB has its own units in various states called Subsidiary IBs. In the British Era these were called the Provincial Special Branch. This is a lean staff. It works largely through the local police and State Intelligence branches (not to be confused with the Subsidiary IB)

The distinction between the Subsidiary IBs and the State IBs is important.

Subsidiary IBs report to the Centre while State IBs report to the State government. If the political parties in power are different at both places, trouble can ensue. Especially given the vicious political environment in which the country has been operating in the last two decades

Since there is no legal mandate anyway for the Intelligence Bureau and no oversight - intelligence sharing and information withholding, depends entirely on a system of back channels. An attempt to pass a security services bill in 2011 actually tried to formalize the back-channel sytem as a ""security measure.""

State IB reporting to Party B, may not be able to share information with SubIBs or with each other, if they are not alliance partners. Or if the alliance has soured. The souring of relations between AP and Centre is a case in point. To complicate matters, Andhra may want to spy on Telangana or vice versa. Or Bihar way want to spy on Orissa.

After all, a significant part of the intelligence agenda is political by mandate.

So what do they do? They walk all over each others' legs and come in each others' way.

But if all this is so obviously murky and stupid and a real dingbat idea, how and why does it happen at all?

Surely, there is someone in 70 years of Independence who saw through this whole scam, came to power and said this should stop? After all, no one stays in power in all the states, all the time.

The party that wields an intelligence bureau today, knows that it will be at the receiving end of it a few years later. So why does this go on?

The Hydra-Headed monster

In 1888, when McCracken became the first director of the Intelligence Bureau in India he was officially the assistant general superintendent, Thagi and Dakaiti Department.

From this vantage point, he would frequent the lavish living rooms of kings, viceroys, nizams and maharajas with as much ease as he roamed the backrooms of dingy police stations.

In People's Maharaja the authorised biography of Amrinder Singh, Khushwant Singh makes a passing mention of McCracken as a tale-tattler and gossip monger, writing to a deputy secretary about the Maharaja of Patiala's private marriage to the Irish Florry Bryan.

This is pretty much how the IB has continued to function post Independence.

With no direct recruits really, it draws from and deputes to, the Indian Police Service, the Indian Postal Service, the Indian Administrative Service, the Indian Revenue Service - basically from anywhere it sees ""talent"" and to anywhere it sees the need.

The British era Thagi and Dakaiti department has been replaced by anti-Naxal departments, the anti-terrorist cells, the anti-smuggling departments, counter-intelligence department, anti-FICN department etc. Basically, any department you might notice with extraordinary legal powers that necessarily abrogate Schedule III of the constitution.

Since the Indian social system, of which the judicial system is but a part, is quick to chuck its fundamental rights and freedoms in the gutter at the mere mention of a possible physical threat - fear is the key. If a real cause for fear does not exist, manufacturing fear is really easy.

The story doesn't end

But the story doesn't end there. While McCracken was answering to his British masters, a good question to ask is: Who does the IB answer to today?

Technically, it is listed as answerable to the Minister of Home Affairs. But - and this is true - ""there is no act of the Indian parliament nor executive order relating to the functioning of the IB."" None.

Despite a budget of Rs 1500 crores, this organisation is not a legal entity under Indian law. Worse, this is not unknown to the judiciary.

In 2012, a former IB officer filed a PIL, asking the organisation to explain its constitutional or statutory sanction. Senior IB Officer RN Kulkarni told the court, ""all that the IB has to explain for its evolution over the past 125 years is the British order issued in 1887. Neither the Indian Independence nor the adoption of a Constitution nor even regulatory statutes for Central police organisations like the CRPF and CISF ever accorded any legal status to the IB, which exists in a constitutional vacuum.""

When the court asked the Centre to explain its position, it responded saying: ""the IB is a civilian organisation which does not enjoy police powers.""

The retired IB Officer, R.N. Kulkarni, went on to write a book called Sins of National Conscience, which is not available at any bookstore.

In 2015, in the Priya Pillai lookout notice case, counsel for the Greenpeace activist Indira Jaising successfully argued that the IB had no authority to issue a LO circular. Justice Rajiv Shakdher found merit in Jaising's argument that a home ministry's office memo of 2010 was not a valid legal mandate and ruled it ""unsustainable, as it cannot be described as law.""

In 2017-2018, the home ministry continued to acknowledge the lack of legal mandate for IB when the 8 PPMDS and 26 PMMS medals for the IB had to be categorised under the Union Home Ministry, instead of a legal intelligence body.

Yet, this hasn't deterred intelligence officials from pursuing their own mandate. In 2012, the same year as India celebrated its 65th Independence anniversary, the Intelligence Bureau celebrated its 125th year of founding. It even brought out a special issue to mark the occasion.

The IB sees itself as coming from an older tradition than Independent India. At its very core, it pays homage to a set of values that are not compatible with the idea of freedom and liberty. In its very founding, history and traditions, it is anti-freedom.

How could it be different? It was founded to suppress voices against empire.

A hundred and twenty-five years of traditions of empire - whichever one they choose to serve for the moment - may modernise such organisations. But no amount of time changes the essentially status quoist nature of such organisations with such a strong culture.

To give private organisations with no police authority overt sweeping powers to snoop and surveil citizens of India is to enter Gulag territory.

Yes, we always knew some people were always under surveillance. Yes, having nothing to hide is a good thing. But no this isn't as small an issue as everyone want to believe it is.

In an era when criticism can get you thrown into jail on charges of sedition or under the National Security Act; when the system of checks and balances has failed; when the social contract does not exist; then all free thought is a possible trespass. Because freedom itself is a violation of the status quo."

The Local Government (General) Regulation 2005 sets out the requirements for contracts to which section 55 applies.

A contract, and any variation or discharge of the contract, must be in writing and be executed by or on behalf of the council (Regulation 165).

Whenever a council is required by section 55 to invite tenders, Regulation 166 states that it must decide which of the following is to be used:

Regulation 170 states that the tender documents must:

Regulation 171 relates to shortened tender periods and states that if a council believes there are exceptional circumstances it may decide on an earlier deadline than that advertised.

However, the earlier deadline must be a specified time on a date that is at least 7 days after the first publication of the advertisement.

A council must also keep a record of:

Similarly if, having specified or included a deadline in an advertisement, a council becomes aware of circumstances that show the deadline may not allow enough time for meaningful tenders, it may extend the deadline (Regulation 172).

The council must then take all reasonable steps to inform people of the later deadline.

As with a shortened deadline, council must then keep a record of:

Regulation 175 prescribes that at the time specified for the close of tenders, the appropriate person must open the tenders in the presence of:

In certain circumstances tenders may be varied (Regulation 176).

At any time before a council accepts any tenders for a proposed contract, a person who has submitted a tender may vary it by providing the council with further information by way of explanation or clarification, or by correcting a mistake or anomaly.

Such a variation may be made either at the request of the council or the tenderer. The council may only accept the tenderer's request for a variation if it seems reasonable to do so in the circumstances.

If a tender is varied, the council must provide all other tenderers whose tenders have the same or similar characteristics the opportunity to vary their tenders in a similar way.

A council must not consider a variation of a tender if the variation would substantially alter the original tender, and the council must keep a record of:

After considering the tenders submitted for a proposed contract, the council must either (Regulation 178):

A council must ensure that every contract it enters into as a result of an accepted tender is with the successful tenderer and in accordance with the tender (modified only by any variation under Regulation 176).

A council that decides not to accept any of the tenders or receives no tenders for the proposed contract must, by resolution, do one of the following:

However, if a council resolves to enter into negotiations, the resolution must state the council's reasons for declining to invite fresh tenders or applications, and for deciding to enter into negotiations with the person or persons.

The Guidelines were adopted by the Deputy Director General (Local Government), Department of Premier and Cabinet under section 23A of the Local Government Act 1993.

They provide a practical and detailed guide to tendering in accordance with the Act and Regulation, and must be taken into consideration by all councils when exercising their tendering functions.

The Guidelines are divided into four sections:

Guiding principles - sets out the overarching principles that apply to the tendering process.

Procurement management - outlines processes necessary to effectively manage the process.

The tendering process - outlines the stages involved in the process with reference to specific legislative requirements and recommended practices.

Resources - provides useful publications, websites and contacts as well as a tendering checklist and list of commonly used terms.

Section 3, the tendering process, is the heart of the Guidelines; in particular, Part 3.6, which deals with developing the tender documents.

Section 4, Resources, includes a very useful Tendering Checklist

The Model code is made under section 440 of the Local Government Act 1993 and the Local Government (General) Regulation 2005.

It sets the minimum standards of conduct for council officers and requires every council to adopt a code of conduct that incorporates the provisions of the Model Code.

Failure by a councillor to comply with the standards of conduct constitutes misconduct for the purposes of the Act.

Failure by a member of staff to comply with a council's code of conduct may give rise to disciplinary action.

Specifically, it prescribes that a councillor or officer must not conduct himself or herself in a manner that:

A councillor or officer must:

An act or omission in good faith, whether or not it involves error, will not constitute a breach of the Model Code.

Misrepresentation is the false statement of a material fact made by one party to another to induce that other party to enter into a contract.

A person must not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive (section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law).

The statement or representation may be unintentional.

The statement or representation may be made by omission - there will be an actionable misrepresentation if a party had a reasonable expectation that if a relevant matter existed it would be disclosed.

The consequence of misrepresentation in the tender process can be a claim for damages or to be able to rescind (or refuse to enter) the tender contract or both.

A request for tender (RFT) can itself constitute a contract, known as a ""process contract"".

By submitting a tender in response to the RFT, a binding contract between the tenderer and council is formed that requires the process set out in the RFT to be followed in evaluating the tenders and awarding the tender contract.

We've had shockers at both ends of the spectrum, and we're here to examine the biggest ones.We'll be basing our choices on factors like preseason expectations, past performances and recent trends.

Now put your hand down because you're probably lying.Some believed Mahomes could succeed as the Kansas City Chiefs starter. To think that he would immediately become a front-runner for NFL MVP? That just isn't something that unproven young quarterbacks do.Mahomes has done just that. He's thrown left-handed passes, no-look passes, passes with unconventional arm angles and passes on the run -- and he's passed Aaron Rodgers as the league's most physically talented signal-caller.Through 15 games, he's passed for 4,816 yards with 48 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He was even recently named the top quarterback in the NFL by the Associated Press. It's taken him all of 16 games to get to this point.This is only unsurprising because we've seen him play over the last four months.2 of 9Seth Wenig/Associated PressIf Mahomes is the new Aaron Rodgers, does that make Rodgers the new...Peyton Manning? While Rodgers hasn't fallen off quite the way Manning did in 2015, he hasn't played up to the level we've become accustomed to.Statistically, Rodgers is having a great season (4,416 yards, 25 touchdowns, two interceptions), but he's frequently missed open receivers, stalled drives and failed to deliver in the clutch. As a result, the Packers were handed an early exit from playoff contention, cannot even reach .500 and have fired longtime head coach Mike McCarthy.Rodgers can bounce back next season, but he'll be trying to do so with a new head coach.

Adrian Peterson wasn't even on the team yet.Of course, Guice tore his ACL in his preseason opener, and the Redskins eventually added Peterson. Even then, though, it was nearly impossible to envision the 33-year-old returning to prime form and rushing for 1,000 yards.This is exactly what Peterson has done, though. He topped 1,000 yards for the season in Week 16, becoming the oldest player to do so in more than 30 years.""Hopefully I'll be able to appreciate it after Christmas or something,"" Peterson said Saturday, per John Keim of ESPN.com. ""But for the time being, I play this game to win and to have the opportunity to win a championship.""Peterson won't be taking Washington to the playoffs, but that's because of the loss of quarterback Alex Smith for the season. Peterson has been one of the best backs in the NFL, which is quite surprising.4 of 9Don Wright/Associated PressLast season, Pittsburgh Steelers kicker was a Pro Bowler and an honorary member of the ""Killer B's"" alongside Ben Roethlisberger, Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell. Because of this, the Steelers gave Boswell a shiny new four-year, $16.8 million deal with $7.3 million guaranteed.So we'd forgive you for laughing off the idea that he'd be wildly unreliable and barely hanging onto a job in Pittsburgh with a game left to play. That's where we're at, though.""That's the nature of this business,"" Boswell said, per Ray Fittipaldo of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""We're judged on stats and wins and losses. If you don't do your job, they look elsewhere.""Boswell has missed seven of 20 field-goal attempts and five point-after tries. The Steelers have worked out other kickers, including Kai Forbath, but they appear to be riding Boswell into the final week of the season.5 of 9Michael Wyke/Associated PressThis is another two-part surprise. It's pretty shocking that running back Le'Veon Bell gave up $14.5 million to skip the 2018 season.Missing a few games? Sure, that's not too surprising because Bell made it clear he didn't want to play an entire season under the franchise tag. But $14.5 million -- and a whole season -- is a ton of guaranteed money to give up just because you want to be healthy for your next contract.It could end up costing Bell big time because, surprise, the Steelers' issues are not because of him.Are the Steelers dominating on the ground? No, they're actually ranked 31st in rushing with an average of 92.0 yards per game. However, James Conner (909 rushing yards, 12 touchdowns, 4.5 yards per carry) kept the ground attack going just fine when he was healthy. With 52 receptions and 467 yards, he also took over Bell's role as a third receiver.Jaylen Samuels has since taken over the job, and he's averaging 4.7 yards per carry. He has 254 yards rushing, 159 yards receiving and three touchdowns. He's made a mere three starts.Would Pittsburgh be better with Bell? Perhaps. However, it is likely to miss the playoffs because of inconsistent defense and the aforementioned kicking issues more than running back problems.6 of 9Lynne Sladky/Associated PressJacksonville Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles has not been good this season. That's not a major shock because he's been an up-and-down player throughout his career. What is surprising is just how far the Jaguars have fallen as a team.They came within a few plays of beating the New England Patriots and reaching the Super Bowl last year. They have won just five game this year.The Jaguars defense has still been statistically sound -- it's allowed 19.7 points per game -- but it's been weak against the run (115.7 yards per game allowed) and hasn't racked up sacks (55 in 2017, 31 in 2018) and turnovers (33 in 2017, 16 in 2018) like it did last season.Jacksonville has struggled to run the ball, and it has turned the ball over at an alarming rate. The Jaguars were plus-10 in turnover differential last season, and they're minus-11 in 2018.All of this has led to a massively disappointing season and has seen Bortles go from getting a new $54 million deal to fighting for his job with Cody Kessler. 7 of 9Frank Victores/Associated PressOver the summer, the two biggest stories surrounding the Oakland Raiders were the return of Jon Gruden and the contract holdout of Khalil Mack. Who would have guessed then that these two men would never so much as meet each other while with the same franchise?The Raiders got two first-round picks from the Chicago Bears in return, so it isn't all that surprising that Gruden was willing to pull the trigger. However, his public reasoning has always seemed a bit disingenuous.""Obviously, Khalil Mack didn't want to play here,"" Gruden told Lisa Salters of ESPN.Just before the trade deadline, Oakland traded away No. 1 receiver Amari Cooper. With that move, it became clear that Gruden had no intention of engineering a quick turnaround. He wanted to acquire future first-round picks -- he got another for Cooper -- to forge a long-term game plan to take into Las Vegas.We always knew that Gruden would build his own Raiders roster, but he's done so shockingly fast.8 of 9Kelvin Kuo/Associated PressBaltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson has been a surprise for a variety of reasons. He's led the Ravens to five wins in their last six games and on the verge of an AFC North title. He's done so by leading a rushing attack that is averaging 143.0 yards per game, and he's done it both by running and passing the football.Jackson has thrown for 1,022 yards, rushed for 605 yards and accounted for nine touchdowns. He's playing the quarterback position in a way we haven't quite seen in the NFL before, and he's having a ton of success.While this cannot shock everyone, the fact he's having such immediate success is a bit surprising.Remember, many teams wanted to try him out at receiver heading into the draft, per Peter Schrager of NFL Network's Good Morning Football. He wasn't supposed to be this NFL-ready, and few thought he'd even get into the starting lineup as a rookie.According to OddsShark, the early over/under on rookie starts for Jackson was just 0.5 games. Jackson has clearly already topped that number, and if he can beat the Cleveland Browns in Week 17, he'll top that number in the postseason too.9 of 9Ron Schwane/Associated PressThe current trend in the NFL is to hire the hot up-and-coming offensive mind like Sean McVay or Matt Nagy to help your young signal-caller. Who knew the Browns had one hiding on their coaching staff since Week 1?The fact that the Browns are having success with No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield isn't all that surprising. He went that high for a reason. What's been shocking is just how good the five-time Pepsi Rookie of the Week has been with interim head coach Gregg Williams and interim offensive coordinator Freddie Kitchens in charge.Williams has brought a new energy to the entire team, while Kitchens, 44, has been exactly the kind of offensive innovator franchises dream of.""Freddie might be the Sean Payton of 13 years ago when he got hired by New Orleans,"" former NFL quarterback Dan Orlovsky said, per Peter King of Pro Football Talk.Cleveland is one win away from having a winning record for the first time since 2007. For a team that went 1-31 over the last two seasons combined, that's surprising. If you told someone that it got to this point only after head coach Hue Jackson and offensive coordinator Todd Haley were fired and the Browns went 5-2 with an interim staff, you'd probably be getting laughed at up until it actually happened.

""There will be three towers, which will be a mix of residential and commercial spaces. The details are being worked out and we should be in a position to float tenders in the coming two months,"" a senior official said. The MMRDA owns the property and is also the special planning authority (SPA). Sources said that they want to build it along the lines of Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). Some of the residential flats will be kept aside for MMRDA staff, while the rest will be sold in open market. The proceeds from the sale will be used in part to help finance the ailing Monorail.

The MMRDA terminated the contract of the Larsen & Toubro-Scomi Engineering consortium and took over the operations and maintenance of the Monorail on December 14. In the first week it collected over ₹7 lakh from ticketing revenue. MMRDA officials said they are also working on generating revenue from non-fare sources such as advertising in stations and trains, providing telecom towers, etc. Officials said that commercialisation of the land will also boost passenger traffic on the Monorail.

MMRDA will soon be issuing tenders for critical spare parts for six Monorail rakes that are not functional. ""Since the spares are needed urgently, we will be floating a quick tender, which will be closed within 15 days. We aim to have the spares in the next two months,"" a senior official said. The spares are critical for MMRDA to commence operations for the crucial 10.6 km Phase Two of the Monorail, which runs from Wadala to Jacob Circle. At present MMRDA has only four functional rakes, which has restricted them to operating the service on the 8.8 km Phase One from Chembur to Wadala. MMRDA officials said that with two additional functional rakes they will be able to run services on the entire corridor at a 20-minute frequency.

At present services run on the 8.8 km Phase One at a 15-minute frequency. After Phase Two is commissioned the fares will also increase and range from ₹10 to ₹40. Tickets at present range from ₹5 to ₹11.

MMRDA will also be floating additional tenders for 10 new Monorail rakes, which will be procured in batches of five. Scomi Engineering was supposed to provide 15 rakes in total of which it supplied only 10.

Phase One of the Monorail was commissioned in 2014 after several delays, and remained shut for nearly a year after a fire gutted two coaches in November 2017. Services between Chembur and Wadala resumed on September 1, 2018."

The Polish company has proposed a tram 1,813199 billion when the expected amount of purchases 1,946 billion. While PESA originally proposed them for 1,846 billion.

For participation in the tender were also submitted by the company ""Tatra-Yug"", but her application was rejected because of violation of the terms of the tender documents.

In 2016, the media found out that the trams from Poland are not suitable for the Ukrainian capital.

In Kiev there are almost no suitable routes for this 26-foot three-section staff. For the street speed lines it is not suitable due to the small capacity of 255 passengers.

President Donald Trump and top Democrats in Congress sparred over the partial shutdown of the U.S. government on Monday, with no sign of tangible efforts to reopen agencies closed by a political impasse over Trump's demand for border wall funds.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and his counterpart in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, accused Trump of being under the sway of conservative House Republicans and blasted the White House for saying ""different things about what the president would accept or not accept.""

""It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,"" Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement as the shutdown dragged through a third day.

""Meanwhile, different people from the same White House are saying different things about what the president would accept or not accept to end his Trump Shutdown, making it impossible to know where they stand at any given moment,"" they said.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Late on Monday, in a White House appearance where he talked with children by telephone about Christmas and Santa Claus, Trump was asked by reporters if there had been any progress in talks about funding the government.

""Nothing new,"" Trump said. ""We need border security.""

Trump, who canceled plans to go to his Florida resort on Friday for Christmas because of the shutdown, was scheduled to discuss border security with U.S. homeland security officials on Monday afternoon. Afterward, Trump said in a Twitter message: ""I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas.""

He gave no details, and the White House did not immediately respond to a request to comment on what he meant.

Earlier the president said on Twitter that he was ""all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security.""

Each side has blamed the other for the shutdown, with no sign of renewed negotiations between lawmakers on Capitol Hill or between lawmakers and the White House. On Sunday, a top Trump aide said the shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take control of the House.

Funding for about one-quarter of federal programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. Without a deal to break the impasse over Trump's demand for $5 billion for a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico, the shutdown is likely to stretch into the new year.

Building the wall was one of Trump's most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it. The Senate adjourned for the Christmas holiday on Saturday as Trump held fast to his demand and Democrats refused to budge.

A day earlier, Republican leaders in the Senate came up short in their effort to win enough support to approve a bill passed by the House that had the wall funds Trump has demanded.

Schumer and Pelosi on Monday lashed out at the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative group that includes some of the president's most loyal supporters in Congress. Trump discussed border security at a Saturday lunch with Republican lawmakers that included some Freedom Caucus members but no Republican leaders.

""As long as the president is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it's hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his Trump Shutdown,"" the two Democrats said in their statement.

Over the weekend, Trump budget director and White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the White House had made a counter-offer to Democrats on border security funding that fell between a Democratic proposal of $1.3 billion and Trump's much higher demand.

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" Trump tweeted on Monday.

Trump wants the Democrats to fund for a border wall to stop illegal immigrants from entering the US. Democrats have refused his demands for USD 5 billion in funding for his border wall in a standoff that resulted in a partial government at midnight on Friday.

""At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about. Crazy!"" Trump said.

Several hours later, Trump said in a tweet that he was in the Oval Office and working on border security.

""I am in the Oval Office and just gave out a 115-mile-long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of dollars, and lives, will be saved!"" he said.

He also tweeted a picture of him with senior administration officials for a briefing on North Korea.

""Nothing new on the shutdown. We need more security,"" he told reporters during this phone call with children.

Santa Tracker is a 63-year tradition of tracking Santa's sleigh from the North Pole to children all over the world.

Despite the shutdown, military personnel were on the operation, as were reportedly some 1,500 people who volunteer each year.

Trump told a kid named Coleman, ""Hello, is this Coleman? Merry Christmas. How are you? How old are you?.... Are you doing well in school? Are you still a believer in Santa Claus?""

""How are you? Are you tracking Santa? ...I want to wish you a Merry Christmas. Thank you. Nice talking to you,"" Melania told an unidentified child.

""What's Santa going to get you for Christmas? Who's with you....Have a great Christmas., and I'll talk to you again, OK?"" Trump told another kid, possibly from Indiana.

Earlier this year, the Indian parliament amended the Finance Bill 2018 and the new amendment allowed political parties to accept foreign funding without scrutiny. In fact, it was a retrospective amendment which exempted parties from scrutiny for funds they received as far back as 1976.

But NGOs working in India's health sector have been battling the government over this very same issue. Specifically speaking, NGOs working on tobacco control such as the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and the Institute of Public Health (IPH) have been embroiled in months of administrative logjam as their licenses to receive foreign funding were suspended, related to their work on tobacco control.

And the Bloomberg Foundation, which gives millions of dollars to health organisations around the world working on tobacco control, has also been investigated by Indian intelligence agencies. The two-year-old investigation has not yet reportedly shown any actual malpractice on the foundation's part.

Now in a fresh conflict, another long standing NGO - Socio Economic and Educational Development Society (SEEDS) - funded by the Bloomberg Foundation to work on tobacco control, found itself suddenly isolated by the Delhi government. This was in November. Last week, they just as suddenly found themselves in the clear. The Delhi government has not issued any clarification on the turn around.

Bloomberg funded NGO prohibited from ""any activity""

A Delhi government note in November called for the sweeping prohibition of ""any activity"" by NGOs, especially SEEDS, who get any international funding or who get funding form the Bloomberg Foundation, unless it is approved by the Delhi government.

Although the note is titled generally, it in fact is specifically about SEEDS and Bloomberg and says that SEEDS did not submit details of the project and its funding to the Delhi government for seven months.

The note was signed by S.K, Arora, Additional Director in the Delhi government and in charge of the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP). Within three weeks of this, Arora has been taken off the tobacco portfolio. Arora was designated tobacco control for many years, and won a World Health Organization award for his work this year.

In four weeks, Arora's successor, Dr. Bhagwan Singh Charan, has overturned Arora's order without giving any reason.

Dr Arora declined to comment on the matter as he is no longer handling this portfolio but said he is ""demoralised"" by his transfer and that he had only acted in the interest of ""maintaining funding transparency so that good work done by anyone should not become questionable on any ground"". ""It is shocking that no one is asking the NGO, why the project and funding details are not being shared,"" he said.

Deepak Mishra who heads SEEDS contests this. He says that SEEDS had submitted details on their proposed activities to Arora's office in April this year and followed up on this for six months, only to be told that these documents were misplaced.

""We are assisting state governments in Bihar and Jharkhand in implementing the national tobacco control programme. There, it is the chief secretary of the state who is also the head of the tobacco control committee. Those state governments have not been cutting ties with us because we receive foreign funding. Only Delhi government put forward these obstacles,"" says Puranjit Banerjee, regional director at SEEDS.

In a letter to the principal secretary for health and family welfare of the Delhi government, SEEDS explains that they already are registered under the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) to receive foreign funds, and these funds are regulated by the ministry of home affairs. They explained that some details of funding are bound by a legal contract between Bloomberg and funding partners, so they may not immediately be available for sharing.

But the state government's memo was wide reaching, naming and penalising SEEDS, in what the NGO sees as disproportionate, and a ""defamation"".

A Delhi government source explains that an FCRA license doesn't mean that SEEDS is exempt from sharing details on their funding and project with the local government.

Further, the ""NGO has received funds in the name of the NTCP. So they cannot work on their own without collaboration with state governments,"" says the source. The person explains that the state tobacco control cell still needs to sign a memorandum with NGOs like SEEDS in order to partner with them, and for that NGOs will have to part with all information on their funding.

""The Bloomberg website says they are already working with the Delhi government but this is not true. Is Bloomberg not monitoring their funds?,"" says the Delhi government source.

Health NGOs taking the hit for tobacco control

While the situation for SEEDS turned around quickly and in their favour, this has not been the case for public health NGOs in India over the last year who work on tobacco control.

SEEDS chose to take on the issue straight on and immediately, writing strong letters to the Delhi government, mincing no words in their complaint.

But other organisations like the PHFI and IPH have taken it more quietly and much slower. PHFI for example, submitted hundreds of pages of documents to the home ministry, and after about twelve months, they were re-awarded their FCRA license but not told why it was suspended in the first place. Although they have a license, their fund inflows are still subject to slow and lengthy regulation. IPH has also chosen to tackle the issue quietly, taking up a legal challenge which has itself not progressed fast.

Various other smaller NGOs have suspended their work on tobacco control, dissolving staff positions and projects."

During the next calendar year, Army is expected to get 48 guns of 155x45 mm calibre in all. These include 18 Dhanush and 30 Sarang guns. The latter is an upgraded version of 130mm gun already with the Army. The Sarang will be made at the Ordnance Factory, Kanpur, and a contract has already been signed.

For Dhanush, the GCF will have to wait for the final GSQR evaluation on the basis of which it would be getting the bulk production order. Officials say what remains to be done now is merely a formality. GSQR evaluation is only compilation of reports of earlier trials.

The GCF will be supplying 114 guns in all in three years after the first batch is sent. On the basis of it an order of another 400 guns would be placed by the Army. On the other hand, Sarang would go in the batches of 30, 70, and 100 each on yearly basis, the source said. The production capacity at GCF will have to be scaled for meeting the future requirement, said an officer.

The factory has also created infrastructure to provide spares for the existing fleet of Bofors guns.

GCF, set up in early 1900s, is expecting a major workload in coming days. A prototype of 155x52mm mounted gun has been developed and the factory hopes to bid as Army plans to place an order for 814 pieces. The major chunk of 155x52mm guns, for which the process of private procurement has started, will be made on transfer of technology basis at the GCF.

A trial by fire, literally

Jabalpur: Dhanush guns had to go through a trial by fire to be finally selected. The first of the trials was undertaken in 2013 in which a shell burst within the barrel itself. After a series of successful testfires, there were two incidents of muzzle hits in 2017. In this, the shell broke off a part of the barrel. This delayed the project and trials were extended.

After firing nearly 5,000 rounds, which is more than the quantity used in wartime, it has been found there was no fault in the gun's design. Sources said the fault is estimated to have been in the ammunition but no specific reason could be pinpointed.

One of the guns of the first batch of M-777 purchased from the US too suffered a muzzle hit. An investigation was carried out and there were similar results, said sources. Before induction in India, a barrel burst incident was reported in the K-9 guns used by the Korean army.

Sources say other guns had to undergo not more than 500 rounds of test fire, as against 4,994 rounds for Dhanush.

During July-August last year, the GCF had faced a CBI inquiry for buying a Chinese spare for the gun. The component which is a bearing on which the barrel rotates was purchased through tendering from a Delhi-based firm which in turn had bought it from China. The first six guns to be given to Army will have the same spare. No defect has been reported in its functioning. The original manufacturer, Rothe Erde of Germany, had refused to supply the bearing to India citing an international arms ban treaty. The manufacturer has finally agreed, said sources.

Jabalpur: After US' M-777 and K-9 Vajra guns from Korea, were symbolically inducted by army in November -- Dhanush, the indigenous version of Swedish Bofors would be following soon. Going was faster for weapons purchased globally. Dhanush had to fire 5,000 shells during multiple rounds of trials before final selection. Three incidents of malfunctioning and a CBI inquiry had also marred the project. Same malfunction was reported in M-777 and K-9 too though.

Now what remains for Dhanush is a final appraisal under, what is known as general staff quality requirements (GSQR) evaluation. Dhanush has a higher range and advanced systems as compared to original Bofors.

Only paper work, ordnance factory which has made the guns hopes that GSQR evaluation would be completed in January so that the guns can be finally inducted in February. A ceremony has been planned at School of Artillery Deolali near Nashik in February, which is expected to be attended by Prime Narendra Modi, said sources.

Thackeray also attacked his senior ally over the Rafale fighter jet deal, saying a private company which had no experience in making aircraft was given a defence contract.

Thackeray had in January this year said his party will fight all future polls alone, though the BJP has been repeatedly calling for an alliance with the Maharashtra-based regional party.

Besides general elections in 2019, Maharashtra will face assembly polls in the second half of the next year.

""Not all of us are gathered here today in the name of Hindutva. Many are farmers, some of them are farmers' children and we are here to seek justice for farmers,"" he said.

The Sena leader alleged irregularities in a central government-sponsored crop insurance scheme for farmers.

""Despite the government having four state-run companies, 12 private companies were also roped in (implementing the scheme). Those companies have milked the system and gained thousands of crores in profits,"" he alleged.

""What happened with the Rafale deal, is happening in the crop insurance scheme also. In both the cases, companies having no experience were given the task to implement the programmes,"" Thackeray claimed.

The Sena chief said going by this criteria women self-help groups should be asked to make bullets.

""If you can give fighter jet making contract to some Ambani, then you should award the bullet making contract to women self-help groups,"" he said sarcastically.

""Even if we assume the Rafale deal is corruption-free, why are farmers not getting insurance repayment?"" he asked.

The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence is an Indian offset partner of Dassault, the French company that is suppling 36 Rafale jets to India under a Rs 58,000-crore deal.

Reliance Defence has strongly denied allegations of getting undue benefits from the multi-billion dollar Rafale deal.

Addressing a gathering at the foundation-stone laying ceremony for Government Mother and Child Hospital (MCH) in Wanaparthy town on Monday, he said the decision to establish separate hospitals for pregnant women and newborns was taken to prevent them from contracting dangerous communicable diseases, which could spread in a hospital environment where patients suffering from various diseases were being treated on the same premises.

The new 100-bed MCH is being built on Gopalpet road on the outskirts of Wanaparthy town at a cost of Rs 17 crore.

Niranjan Reddy appreciated the staff of the Medical and Health Department for doing a great job in providing quality medical care to patients in the government hospitals in the district. He also lauded the efforts of District Collector Sweta Mohanty for completing the land acquisition for the MCH.

He said a 400-bed government hospital for the district was already approved by the State Cabinet and that there was enough space available to construct more blocks at the MCH, so as to enable construction of a government medical college in the district, which had been the aspiration of the people of Wanaparthy.

He also directed the officials to complete the construction of the MCH within 9 months and hoped more medical and health staff would be recruited in the district by the government soon. He also hoped the government would increase the salaries of contract workers of the Medical and Health Department.

P Krishna Murthy, Chairman, Telangana State Medical Industrial Development Corporation, who also performed Bhumi Puja for the MCH, appreciated the efforts of medical and health officials across the State for effectively ensuring that common people receive the benefits of public healthcare system effectively.

He also said Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao knew that people in rural areas were spending huge sums of money on healthcare for mothers and children; therefore, he introduced various healthcare schemes."

""It has been 30 years and still you say that matter is in the court. Hindus are innocent but not fools. Let there be a discussion in the Parliament on the Ram temple issue. Who you are favouring on this issue will be clear,"" he said.

""Babri Masjid was demolished. Now you are sleeping like 'Kumbhakaran' on your power bed. When will we see a Ram temple? If you will do 'jumla' in the name of God, we will not spare you without kicking you out. We will not leave the Ram Mandir issue and will not let anyone leave this also,"" added Thackeray.

Continuing his tirade against the Central government, Thackeray said, ""I am not going into the useless debate of alliance or no alliance. I just want to get the relief for my farmers. The thing which happened with Rafael, the same thing happened with crop insurance also. If seeking justice is a crime, if asking questions to government is a crime, I will do that crime.""

Demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should visit the drought-hit areas in Maharashtra, he said, ""I don't have any interest in seat sharing. Just tell me when you are compensating farmers for their losses. I have to tell the PM that he travels around the world, sometime he should come to a drought-hit area also. There are claims of Rs 32,000 crore of loan waivers but a single farmer can't be benefitted by it.""

Criticising the Central government on Rafale fighter jet deal, Thackeray said, ""A company which had no experience was given a contract. Soldiers of our country need a pay hike, which you don't give, but you do scams in the purchase of arms and ammunition.

I internalized the character in a manner, where I realized that one does not have to scream to portray anger,"" Saqib told IANS here.

For the show, the 30-year-old went through an extensive process to get into the character.

He said: ""Our director Bhav also guided me to understand how I can channelize my emotion through my eyes rather than playing it loud as it is expected generally when a character of a contract killer is narrated.""

Set in Uttar Pradesh, the story revolves around Shiv Prakash Shukla, a contract killer who entered into the world of crime at a very young age and by the age of 25, he became one of the most wanted criminals of the nation. Shukla died in 1998.

So, was he nervous to take the show on his shoulder?

""I wasn't worried about taking the responsibility of the show. As I am playing the central character, I was a little unsure if I can manage to pull out the character, that is based on the true event, real-life people. This was quite away from my comfort zone. Since the beginning, I never played an out and out spine-chilling killer like this.""

In fact, according to the actor, that was one of the reasons he got excited to be part of the story.

""It was challenging, I was really looking forward to a challenge so that I can put myself in an uncomfortable zone and grow from there,"" Saqib added.

With the national federation's decision to introduce a contracts system for 150 grapplers in India, the sport is set to be professionalised like never before.

What was more historic than this move was the way Bajrang and Vinesh meticulously went about giving solid performances through the year.

It was not just the gold medals but the manner in which the two won them, which raised hopes of India getting its first gold-medallist in the sport come Olympics in less than two years' time.

Speaking of Olympics, 2018 was largely forgettable for Sushil Kumar -- India's only double Olympic-medallist -- and Sakshi Malik -- the country's first and only woman wrestler to win a medal at the biggest stage.

Sushil still had a CWG gold, albeit in a not-so-strong field, to take comfort from but it was a stunning downward spiral that Sakshi went through.

Sakshi's CWG and Asian Games ended in tears, although she did win a bronze in the former event in Gold Coast. The 26-year-old admitted that she needs to be mentally stronger to pull off close bouts.

On the other hand, Sushil's Asian Games challenge fell flat in the first round itself but he rejected suggestions that his dominance was coming to an end. Instead, he remained bullish about his prowess and insisted that he has unfinished business at the Tokyo Games.

The year 2019 -- in which the World Championship will be a chance to book Olympic quota berths -- will determine if the two grapplers remain relevant to Indian wrestling.

Before the Worlds in September in Astana, there will be plenty of events, including the Asian Championship in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan which will provide hints on what lies in store for these two.

Despite the fact that the two are not in great form, the recent Nationals in Gonda failed to throw up any replacements in their respective categories.

Sakshi easily won the national title to finally draw something positive out a largely disappointing year. And the 74kg men's category does not have anyone who is even close to what Sushil is even now.

The Commonwealth Games may not be the best yardstick but considering that the Asian bloc is a powerhouse of the sport, Bajrang and Vinesh's gold medals at the Jakarta Games assume significance.

Vinesh began her victorious Jakarta campaign with a revenge win over Chinese Yanan Sun against whom she suffered the career-threatening knee injury which ended her Rio Olympics campaign in excruciating pain.

In the next bout she brushed aside the challenge of Korea's Hyungjoo Kim by technical superiority, ending the bout with a four-point throw.

Her semifinal lasted just 75 seconds as she moved into the final with a 'fitley' and grabbed the gold with ease, outplaying Japan's Yuki Irie.

These are the same opponents, who are likely to figure in the 50kg category in Tokyo, and experts believe that with such class, Vinesh will be a strong contender for a medal.

While Vinesh missed out on adding a World Championship medal to her kitty due to an injury, Bajrang won a silver at Budapest Worlds to end the year with medals at every major championship this season.

However, the defeat in the world championship final was a reminder that his defence on the leg attack is still a work in progress. Japan's Takuto Otoguro kept attacking Bajrang's right leg and he could not find a way out and had to settle for a second-place finish.

This was after his dominating show throughout the year at the CWG, Tbilisi Grand Prix, Yasar Dogu International and Asian Games. Bajrang ended the year as world number one in 65kg, though an elbow injury pegged him back slightly.

The other Phogats Ritu, Sangeeta, Babita and Geeta more or less endured a quiet year and even missed out on appearing for Asian Games trials.

But one woman, who bit by bit created her own space in Indian wrestling was Pooja Dhanda. She added a World Championship bronze to her CWG gold.

In most of her bouts, she trailed overwhelmingly but managed to bridge the gap and tilt the result in her favour. This was in complete contrast to what Sakshi was doing.

In a three-year deal as Indian wrestling's principal sponsor, Tata Motors' will support the development of the sport at various levels.

It's first benefit is already there to be seen with WFI offering central contracts to 150 wrestlers.

The top A Grade, which offers Rs 30 lakh as support, initially had just Bajrang, Vinesh and Pooja but WFI later added Sushil and Sakshi's name after realizing that the duo's reputation took a hit.

But given their below-par results this year, it didn't seem to be an unfair call to keep them out of the top bracket.

The coming year is an important one for all Olympic disciplines and Indian wrestling can only hope for better results with foreign coaches set to join the national camp.

For the first time, the WFI has managed to procure services of a coach from Asian powerhouse Iran. Hossein Karimi is set to join along with Andrew Cook of USA and Georgia's Temo Kazarashvili on a one-year contract.

Some of the key industry players operating in global pharmacovigilance market are IQVIA (QuintilesIMS), LabCorp, PAREXEL, Cognizant, TCS, Wipro, InVentiv Health Clinical and Accenture. The industry players resort to growth strategies such as merger and acquisitions to strengthen their market share and expand their service offerings. For instance, In September 2016, PAREXEL International Corporation entered into definitive agreement to acquire ExecuPharm. The strategy aimed at enhancing company's existing functional services such as clinical monitoring, pharmacovigilance, data management and other functions allowing clients to fulfill its outsourcing needs.

Pharmacovigilance Market size is set to exceed USD 8.0 billion by 2024; according to a new research report by Global Market Insights.

Rising rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and drug toxicity leading to increased mortality in developed regions is a major driver for market growth. As per the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM), approximately 7,000 people die due to medication errors and ADRs in hospitals and other healthcare settings in the country. This further poses huge cost burden on healthcare systems and fuels demand for pharmacovigilance services.

Rising drug consumption due to increasing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, diabetes across the globe will drive demand for pharmacovigilance services.

Increasing government efforts to bring harmonization in pharmacovigilance practices will positively impact market growth over the coming years. However, lack of adequately skilled and trained healthcare staff coupled with high risk of data security will hamper business growth.

Phase IV clinical trial segment dominated the pharmacovigilance market in 2017 followed by Phase III clinical trial segment that is expected to witness 10.8% CAGR over the coming years. Growing need for monitoring drug safety and evaluating drug efficacy based on risk-benefit ratio will drive phase III clinical trial segmental growth.

In-house pharmacovigilance segment was valued approximately 1.8 billion in 2017 and will witness considerable growth in the coming years. Increased demand for data security and safety along with presence of companies with skilled staff and developed infrastructure for pharmacovigilance services will favor in-house pharmacovigilance market growth. However, high operational associated with in-house services spurs demand for contract outsourcing services.

In 2025, four months pregnant Aparajita is feeling peckish and stops by at a Mumbai convenience store for a mid-morning snack. She picks up a biscuit pack and taps it on her fitness band to check the ingredients and makes sure she is getting the right nutrients and that it is safe for her baby. Yuka, a France-based mobile app is already evaluating the quality of your purchases. It offers an independent evaluation of the food you buy based on three criteria of nutritional quality, presence of risk additives and biological dimension of the product.

Back home that evening, she accidentally drops her medicine bottle. She asks her artificial intelligence (AI)-powered 'smart speaker' to have the medicines delivered immediately. Before she is halfway done with an episode of her favourite show on Netflix, a drone delivers the medicines to her house.

Well, this is just a peek into what already is happening. Fact is, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) will completely transform the shopping experience, replacing today's pain points with captivating, interactive experiences that inform, entertain and save time and money. Moreover, yes, challenges of security, privacy and confidentiality will need to be addressed -- not just by laws but also by a new contract between corporates and consumers. By having specific, transparent, and positive-consent based sharing of personal information with providers who have limited and contractual access to individual data, the drudgery of shopping will be replaced with high-experience, time-efficient visits to retail outlets.

Again, not all of this is in the future. Globally, smart speakers is a $4.3 billion market, expected to grow at 23% compound annual growth rate, as per data from Allied Market Research. In India, during the second quarter (July-September) of fiscal year 2019, IDC reported that shipments of smart speakers saw a 43% quarter on quarter growth. Same day delivery is, of course, mainstream; according to a Dropoff survey, in 2017, 17% of US consumers used same-day delivery, while 31% used it in 2018.

Most e-commerce players are currently piloting drone projects in controlled environments. The big challenge is regulations, as most countries require drones to be within visual line of sight (VLOS) of the drone operator. The Indian government too has taken baby steps by allowing commercial use of drones. As we move ahead, the regulatory restrictions on the role of drones will need to be further streamlined and detailed, while at the same time security and safety issues will need to be balanced since the potential of abuse is high.

Meanwhile in Surat, Neeta, 23, walks into an apparel store to buy a dress for a party she has to attend that evening. Taking out her mobile phone, she scans bar codes of the dresses she likes and sees a 3D image of herself on the mirror-screen. Just a click shows her digital avatar wearing her favourite dresses on the screen. She can turn and twirl with her 3D avatar doing the same. Finally, she selects a couple of outfits on the mobile and walks out of the shop. On her way out, she smiles at the exit mirror. Her identity is verified, payment made seamlessly and product dropped into a lockbox in her apartment lobby -- the bar code on the package gave access to the delivery person to enter the lobby and access the lockbox. Neeta is all set to dazzle the crowd in her new outfit.

This picture of the future augurs well for the environment. With less packaging, less dead inventory, and replenishment-based fulfilment at home (less wastage), the carbon footprint of consumption will not grow as much as it does today.

Known as Memory Mirrors, this smart AR mirror enables customers to try on a variety of clothes in different colours, virtually, with a 360-degree experience. The same AR technology is also letting customers try on custom-fit glasses and simulate makeup products on a user's face to show what they would look like in rea world.

Alibaba, meanwhile, has piloted smile recognition technology in KFC outlets where Alipay customers can smile to pay. Alibaba has recently collaborated with Megvii Technology Ltd on designing smart mirrors.

Changing consumption story

In 2005, the income distribution in India was quite like the Eiffel Tower -- a very broad base, tapering quickly and drastically to a very thin top. In 2005, 7 in 10 households were in the ""low income"" group -- a subsistence level of consumption where there was little discretionary spend. Today, we have progressed to the great pyramids in income distribution. We are now at a level where 6 in 10 households belong to either the middle or upper income groups, and they have steadily powered growth in consumption across all categories.

Over the next 10 odd years, we envision that the pyramid will morph again, and income distribution will take the shape of a diamond. This burgeoning expansion of the middle class will result in buoying the middle class bucket to 300 million, now accounting for over 80% of our households. Existing households becoming more prosperous will equally drive this increase in the middle class, and the creation of new, young households where youngsters will be more educated and better employed than their parents were.

This macro metamorphosis of the Eiffel Tower into a pyramid and then to a diamond will be further embellished by the internet and digital inclusion. By 2030, over 1 billion Indians will have access to the internet. As more of India is 'connected', more technology-savvy consumers will begin to define shopping and consumption trends. Digitally influenced purchases will become the norm; almost 40% of all purchases will be digitally influenced in the near future.

Where virtual is real

Advances in mobile telephony will present new opportunities as they run an array of offerings starting from mobile-armed sales staff to mobile-enhanced product reviews, mobile-responsive websites, and discounts on demand via apps while shopping within a store. Mobile accessories are also redefining the digital shopping experience, making it simple, fast and fun, while not requiring any physical interface.

By 2025, when 20-year-old Sunil enters a leading branded shoe store, and is unable to find the right size, he gives his measurements and the 3D printing machine starts printing out customized shoes for him. While they wait for it, he goes over to the basketball 'stadium' in the store to shoot some hoops.

His shoe is done in a few minutes and he decides to try it on the VR running track, also at the same outlet. After a quick round ""around"" the track, he is convinced that the pair is meant for him. Meanwhile, the sportswear company has registered his speed and calculated the discount based on the boy's performance.

VR is already a reality in shopping. A US-based adventure products company is putting VR into its stores to make shopping an immersive experience in which customers form emotional connections. In some US stores, it had customers virtually travel to a national park, where they accompanied rock-climbers in a 360-degree VR experience with 3D sound. In a Korean store, it had customers shopping for winter jackets sit down on a sled and go on a virtual dog sledding experience, after which they surprised the customers by launching them straight into a real dog sledding adventure through the mall, ending in catching the jacket they had been trying on at the finish line.

Some others are using AR to let customers virtually place furniture in their homes and assess how it would look. For instance, one retailer's app generates true-to-size reproductions of its products within the customer's home, from a couch against the wall to see how it might fit, to a ceiling lamp for how it matches the rest of the room's aesthetics.

In conclusion

Close to home, smart wearables are already seeding in India at a rapid pace. As per IDC, the second quarter of 2018 saw 1 million shipments of smart wearables, witnessing a 40% quarter on quarter growth.

In a corner of Patna, Rajesh, 45, a ride-hailing electric cab driver has just reached home to listen to his 17-year-old daughter recount how she picked up the T-shirt that her dad had promised for her birthday. At the metro station on her way back from school, she photographed a cool T-shirt ad and searched for 'similar designs' on a shopping site. The site, which had evolved machine learning capabilities, threw up different options. She selected a few she liked and shared on her chat group. After getting her friends' approval, she is curious to understand the specific fit and pings customer service of the shopping site. The customer service bot answered all her questions and she placed the order, which was delivered within a few hours.

Indeed bots will play a crucial role in the future shopping experience and provide a conversational commerce service on various messaging and social media platforms that customers use daily. Social media is becoming shoppable, with some startups making any post a kick-off for a fast checkout. Meanwhile, startups like Bringhub now place the most relevant products on any given page on the web. Leveraging natural language processing and image recognition, Bringhub analyzes web pages and can pick out exactly the most relevant products to feature on a webpage based on the webpage's content, letting retailers bring exactly the right shopping journey to the customer browsing anything anywhere on the web.

These advances are as much behavioural as they are about technology. In addition, none of these are in the 'yet to be built' category: each one referenced is already being tested somewhere in the world. It is only a matter of time before they become part of our retail experience too."

""Today I convened individual calls with the CEOs of the nation's six largest banks,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Twitter shortly before financial markets were due to open in Asia.

U.S. equity index futures dropped late on Sunday as electronic trading resumed to kick off a holiday-shortened week. In early trading, the benchmark S&P 500's e-mini futures contract was off by about a quarter of a percent.

The Treasury said in a statement that Mnuchin talked with the chief executives of Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.

""The CEOs confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending,"" the Treasury said.

Mnuchin ""also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury said.

Mnuchin's calls to the bankers came amid a partial government shutdown that began on Saturday following an impasse in Congress over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico. Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs expired at midnight on Friday and the shutdown could continue to Jan. 3.

The Treasury said Mnuchin will convene a call on Monday with the president's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes Washington's main stewards of the U.S. financial system and is sometimes referred to as the ""Plunge Protection Team.""

The group, which was also convened in 2009 during the latter stage of the financial crisis, includes officials from the Federal Reserve as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Wall Street is also closely following reports that Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Mnuchin said on Saturday Trump told him he had ""never suggested firing"" Powell.

Trump has criticized the U.S. central bank for raising interest rates this year, which could further dampen economic growth. The Fed's independence is seen as a pillar of the U.S. financial system.

Mnuchin's calls come as a range of asset classes have suffered steep losses.

In December alone, the S&P 500 is down nearly 12.5 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite has slumped 13.6 percent. The Nasdaq is now in a bear market, having declined nearly 22 percent from its record high in late August, and the S&P is not far off that level.

Effective midnight, Friday, December 21st, there is a partial federal government shutdown in effect.

Earlier this week, the National League of Cities (NLC) called on federal leaders to do their jobs and find a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown and keep every federal agency open.

""Cities expect our leaders in Washington to meet their most basic obligation and keep the federal government open,"" said NLC President Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""A federal shutdown would impact programs that grow local economies and build more resilient communities. Instead of wasting $6.5 billion a week on a shutdown, let's put that money to good use -- by investing in America's cities.""

This would be a ""partial"" shutdown because Congress met the deadline to approve five of the twelve total appropriations bills. In addition to all ""mandatory"" spending programs, federal discretionary grant programs administered through the following agencies will not be impacted by the partial shutdown:

For city leaders, this means residents can expect uninterrupted operations and payments from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. VA Hospitals and other service providers for veterans should remain open. Before and after school programs funded by the Department of Education's 21 Century Community Learning Center grants should not be interrupted.

Unfortunately for city leaders, the federal agencies that will be shutting down to various degrees are those that administer most federal grants allocated directly to municipal governments, including:

According to this detailed Q&A from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, when a funding lapse results in the shutdown of a federal agency, the government must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. And according to this White House Shutdown FAQ, all normally, routine, ongoing operational and administrative activities relating to contract or grant administration (including payment processing) cannot continue when there is a lapse in funding. Moreover, federal agency employees who are paid with annual appropriations and who perform an activity associated with contract or grant administration (including oversight, inspection, payment or accounting) should generally not continue work during a lapse in appropriations.

In other words, federal discretionary grants that are administered to local governments from unfunded federal agencies, including HUD's CDBG and HOME grants, DOJ's COPS grants, DOT's TIGER grants, EDA's economic development grants, SBA's small business loans, and USDA's rural loans and grants, will be unavailable for reimbursement to local governments, and agency staff will generally be unavailable to answer questions or offer technical assistance throughout the duration of the partial government shutdown. Any local employees funded by federal grants may also be required to stop work.

The White House Office of Management and Budget maintains a list of each agency's plans here. Additional contingency information may be posted on individual agency websites as well.

A short shutdown of a week or less will have little to no impact on cities (although it will cost the federal government plenty to furlough employees, mothball offices, and reopen even a short time later). The effects of a longer shutdown would multiply quickly, including inaccessible federal funding, project delays and potential layoffs. As federal funding for services dry up, residents usually expect local governments to step in with supplemental funding. Eventually it will fall on cities and states to bear the cost of the shutdown on the broader economy, which will result in less tax revenue for all levels of government.

The federal law that prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in advance of appropriations, the Antideficiency Act, also requires an ""orderly shutdown"" when there has been a lapse in appropriations. Of course, actual government shutdowns are anything but orderly, and there will be exceptions and inconsistencies across the board, known and unknown.

Among the known exceptions and inconsistencies, if there is a partial government shutdown:"

In a breather for the Maharashtra Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL), the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal (MAT), in a series of orders, has dismissed applications filed against it by contract employees. The employees from the cybercrime and tape authentication wing of the FSL had filed an application, demanding that they be allowed to continue in service and their jobs regularised. The MAT, however, ruled in favour of the FSL that recently conducted an examination to hire new contractual employees.

Over 80 employees from the cyber wing had approached the MAT. According to senior FSL officials, they had hired nearly 328 employees for the cyber wing on contract a few years back to reduce pendency. ""Those hired on a contract basis earlier were asked to discontinue. In March this year, we conducted online exams to ensure transparency in the hiring process. Several contractual employees who had been asked to discontinue also appeared for these exams,"" a senior official claimed.

The contractual employees ""expressed grievance as regards the mode and manner in which the examination is conducted...""

The employees also argued that they had been duly selected for these posts and had worked for nearly two to three years. They further argued that they already had experience in dealing with cases of cyber crime and tape identification and would be more useful as compared to freshers who would have to learn everything anew.

The applicants primarily relied on the judgment of the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court in the case of Sachin Dawle, in which lecturers were absorbed in a polytechnic college. The order observed that the petitioners in Dawle's case were in service for more than 10 years, there were 5,000 vacancies of teaching staff in government polytechnic colleges while the advertisement issued by the government was for only 400 posts.

""Even if 400 posts were filled in, more than 4,500 will remain vacant,"" the order read. The order went on to add, ""by no permutation and combination applicants' can be equated and held to be a match or stand on parity with that of the petitioners in Sachin Dawle's case"".

Sunita Devi and her family members were in panic, earlier this month, because they couldn't find an ICU bed for her at the city's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital. The 67-year-old needed immediate intensive care and no Delhi government ambulance was available for an inter-hospital transfer.

""We kept trying. Time was running out. We finally booked a private ambulance for '10,000. We almost lost her,"" said her son, Suresh Kumar.

Dozens of similar cases - some of them turn fatal - are reported every day as the Delhi government's much-touted and free Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) ambulances are fast grinding to a halt due to various reasons, including insufficient funds, Mail Today has learnt.

Of the total 265 ambulances in all 11 zones in the city, 124 are for patient transfers, 110 should have basic life support systems and 31 should have advanced life-support systems.

But almost half of them are off roads, a Mail Today reality check has revealed. Even many of those running often don't have facilities to save patients in transit.

On December 19, Meena Kumari, 30, was at her South Delhi's Moti Bagh house when she began having acute labour pain. Her husband called a CATS ambulance to rush her to the nearby Safdarjung Hospital.

An ambulance came, but it wasn't equipped to handle such a case. The child was delivered inside the vehicle well before it could reach the hospital.

Driver Ramesh Chand Meena himself admitted, ""It was a critical case. She was bleeding. Her condition was worsening. The ambulance didn't have the required facilities. Anything could have happened. We kept our fingers crossed.""

Also, many of the 31 ambulances that are supposed to have advanced life-support systems lack oxygen cylinders, ventilators and suction pumps, multiple officials involved with the project have told Mail Today.

Problems started in January 2015 when the service was paralysed after 800 contractual drivers and paramedics went on an indefinite strike against the government's outsourcing move.

In March 2016, the AAP government partnered with UKSAS-BVG company to run and maintain these ambulances. WIPRO got the contract to operate the CATS control room in East Delhi's Laxmi Nagar.

A purchase was made for 100 basic and 10 advanced life-support ambulances, taking the total number to 265.

The CATS employees have registered several complaints - the last being two weeks ago - with the Delhi government about funds and the poor condition of ambulances.

The gravity of the situation can be understood from the fact that CATS contractual staff went on strike nine times last year.

""For instance, two advanced life support ambulances (DL-1A-2214 & DL-1A-2016) had their road fitness certification expired in November, but they are still running on roads. It's a long list. Sometimes, we're unable to even replace a punctured tyre,"" admitted a CATS employee.

A CATS employee, Ajit Dabas, said that there have been many cases of patients needing critical care but not getting the same. ""Running unfit ambulances is a risk,"" he said.

Delhi Health Secretary Sanjeev Khirwar said that the government is aware of the problem, and that an inquiry is on.

""We have received complaints about poor functioning of CATS ambulances. We are looking into the matter. If the private company looking after their maintenance is found guilty, it would be penalised,"" he told Mail Today.

MK Rawat, head of operations, BVG-UKSAS, however, cited the issue of pending dues.

""If some ambulances are off roads, it must be due to maintenance works. We take even small issues very seriously. Lots of dues are pending with the government. If we're able to run the ambulances in this situation, it's an achievement,"" he told Mail Today.

The government owes Rs 40 crore to the company that has moved the Delhi High Court, sources said.

""Insufficient funds mean manpower shortage, salary delays, poor maintenance of the ambulances and delayed purchases of medical equipment,"" a company official said.

A Delhi government official, however, said that the company should first try to keep its existing fleet in order before asking for more.

""They are not maintaining the ambulances properly,"" he said.

The crisis has prompted the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) to issue a notice to the Delhi government in September. It has sought a detailed report on steps taken by the government to make the service accessible to the citizens by ensuring its full operation.

But there are issues of alleged mismanagement of the control room as well.

The Call 102 app launched in July 2016 allows callers to track booked ambulances. The control room gets 1,000 calls a day, but the ambulance tracking system has also crashed, sources said.

There are also complaints that the staff is often unable to send calls to the zones concerned immediately which leads to delays.

As it is, Delhi has only 1,600 ambulances overall. That's one for every 4,00,000 people. WHO norms say there should be one ambulance for every 50,000 people.

""People like Nirav Modi (a wanted accused in the PNB fraud case) helped in making Modi an 'Avtaar'. PM Modi had facilitated Nirav out of the country with the money of the people"", he alleged.

He also slammed the 'Made in India' and 'Skill India' initiatives of the Central government.

Referring to Nagpur Metro Rail, Kumar questionned handing over of the contract to a ""Chinese company"". ""Is there lack of skill in our country? This is not 'Skill India' but 'Kill India'"", he said.

""The government has asked all public sector companies to construct toilets under 'Swacch Bharat Abhiyan', but the contracts for constructing toilets were given to 600 organisations affiliated with RSS"", he alleged.

Kumar criticised the prime minister on a range of issues like lack of jobs, religious intolerance and agrarian distress.

Leaders of the NCP and the Congress were also present on the occasion.

Table toppers Saurashtra and former champions Mumbai were involved in a keen tussle for the first innings lead on day two of their Elite Group 'A' Ranji Trophy match at the Wankhede Stadium, in Mumbai, on Sunday.

Saurashtra bowled out Mumbai for 394 in the first innings in the morning and then replied with 213 for five wickets at close,still adrift of the home teams total by 181 runs after weathering an early collapse that saw them slumping to 37 for three.

Mumbai struck in the final over by picking up the prize wicket of Saurashtras experienced batsman Sheldon Jackson, who was out five short of a well-deserved century after facing 144 balls in which he struck 8 fours and 3 sixes.

At stumps, Prerak Mankad (56 in 106 balls) was at the crease after putting on a stand of107 runs for the fifth wicket with Jackson who was dismissed by Minad Manjrekar with the penultimate ball of the 65thover.

Dias and Manjrekar have shared four wickets among themselves with all-rounder Dube picking up the other Saurashtra wicket to fall.

In the morning, Saurashtra captain Jaydev Unadkat and his new-ball partner Chetan Sakariya polished off the bottom half of the Mumbai first innings for 60 runs in 18 overs after Mumbai resumed at the overnight 334 for 5.

Unadkat summoned the second new ball straightaway in the morning and provided the important breakthrough by dismissing overnight unbeaten batsman Dube (39).

The Mumbai all-rounder had added just five to his last evening score when he fell that broke the stubborn sixth wicket stand between him and skipper Siddesh Lad, not out 84 overnight, after the addition of 112 runs.

Sakariya took out Akash Parkar, while Unadkat got rid of Tanush Kotian in successive overs to leave Mumbai at 362 for 8.

Lad completed his well-deserved century but was ninth out for 108, falling to Sakariya, after facing 146 balls and hitting 1 six and 16 fours.

Unadkat trapped last man Manjrekar LBW to terminate the Mumbai innings with Roystan Dias unbeaten on 20.

Unadkat grabbed 4 for 71, while fellow left-arm pacer Sakariya and left-arm spinner Dharmendra Jadeja picked up three apiece.

Dias, with his left-arm medium pace, then brought cheers to the Mumbai ranks by striking twice in successive overs to pack off Saurashtra opener Harvik Desai and no. 3 Vishvaraj Jadeja.

Another medium pacer Manjrekar picked up a fine return catch to dismiss Snell Patel to leave the visitors tottering at 37 for three.

Saurashtras mainstay Jackson and Arpit Vasavada (20) stemmed the rot with a stand of 69 when the latter chased a wide ball from Dube and nicked to keeper Aditya Tare.

Jackson, playing fluently till he was hampered by hamstring trouble, and Prerak Mankad, who has hit 10 fours, held the Mumbai hopes at bay with a stubborn partnership till the former departed in the last over to provide Mumbai a shot in the arm going into Day 3 of the four-day match.

Meanwhile at Shimoga, hosts Karnataka secured crucial first innings lead as they bundled out Railways for 143 in their first essay.

Karnataka were 41/0 in the second innings as their overall lead stood at 112 runs at close of play.

At Raipur, Chhattisgarh took the first innings lead with Amandeep Khare (108) and Ajay Mandal (106 not out) hitting centuries.

The duo not only pulled the home team out of trouble but also ensured that they went past Maharashtra's first innings total of 239.

At Nagpur, for hosts Vidarbha, veteran Wasim Jaffer slammed 125 as they ended the second day at 238/3 against Gujarat, still adrift by 83 runs.

Brief scores: Mumbai 394 (Jay Bista 127, Vikrant Auti 57, Siddesh Lad 108, Shivam Dube 39; J Unadkat 4 for 71, C Sakariya 3 for 86, D Jadeja 3 for 95) versus Saurashtra 213 for 5 (Sheldon Jackson 95, Prerak Mankad not out 56; Roystan Dias 2 for 32, Minad Manjrekar 2 for 46).

At Raipur: Maharashtra 239 (Rahul Tripathi 102, Anupam Sanklecha 66, Vishal Singh 4-59) versus Chhattisgarh 332/5 (Amandeep Khare 108, Ajay Mandal 106 not out, Anupam Sanklecha 4-55).

At Shimoga: Karnataka 214 and 41/0 (Dega Nischal 25 not out, D Padikkal 11 not out) versus Railways 143 (Manish Rao 52 not out, Prashant Gupta 35, Ronit More 5-45).

At Nagpur: Gujarat 321 (Kathan Patel 105, Dhruv Raval 79, Karan Patel 55, A A Sarvate 4-71) versus Vidarbha 238/3 (Wasim Jaffer 126, Faiz Fazal 46, S A Desai 2-71).

Rawat century puts Delhi in command vs MP

Anuj Rawat hit a brilliant counter-attacking hundred to nullify Avesh Khan's six-wicket haul as Delhi looked set for an outright win against Madhya Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy group league encounter in New Delhi.

Wicket-keeper batsman Anuj scored 134 off 183 balls as Delhi scored 261 in their first innings in reply to MP's modest 132.

A first innings lead of 129 may well ensure full points for the home team.

The day belonged to left-handed Anuj, who played by far the most impressive innings of his nascent career so far.

The way he attacked under pressure, Rawat felt the pinch having missed out on an IPL contract.

""The innings came a few days late,"" he smiled sheepishly.

""I felt bad but IPL snub has taught me that I need to work a lot harder. This is by far my best innings in senior cricket,"" said the former India U-19 keeper.

Delhi were reduced to 36 for 5, courtesy Avesh (6/51), who worked up brisk pace to unsettle the likes of Kunal Chandela (0), Dhruv Shorey (0), Nitish Rana (0) and Hiten Dalal (0).

Coached by Rajkumar Sharma (Virat Kohli's coach), young Rawat showed admirable temperament and proper game sense as he first consolidated with Lalit Yadav (25) in a 60-run sixth wicket stand.

Once Lalit was dismissed, Rawat found an able ally in Shivam Sharma (39), adding 118 runs for the seventh wicket.

Once Delhi got the lead, Rawat batted more freely hitting on both sides of the wicket.

He repeatedly reverse-swept leg-spinner Mihir Hirwani off the rough and for good measure hooked Kuldeep Sen for a six. He also hit a couple of sixes off left-arm spinner Kartikeya Singh.

Rawat is now getting a longer rope as Rishabh Pant is busy on national duty.

""Even if Rishabh Pant comes back, I want to score as many runs so that I can be picked purely as a batsman,"" said Rawat.

Another former U-19 player, who hogged limelight during the first half was Avesh, who is having a dream Ranji season so far with close to 35 wickets.

""The key to my success has been workload management. The support staff is ensuring that I don't bowl too much in the nets and have kept me fresh for matches,"" said the Delhi Daredevils pacer, who wasn't picked for India A this year.""

""The selection is not in my hands, performance is and that's what I am focussing on,"" he said.

Brief Scores: MP 132 and 7/0.

Delhi 261 (Anuj Rawat 134, Shivam Sharma 39, Avesh Khan 6/51).

Kalsi, Dhawan duo steer HP to strong 340/5 against Tamil Nadu

Ankit R Kalsi (99) closed in on his third first class century as Himachal Pradesh put up a strong batting show to extend their lead to 117 after ending day two of their Ranji Elite Group B fixture against Tamil Nadu at 340 for five, in Dharamsala.

Kalsi (99 batting), Raghav Dhawan (71) and Rishi Dhawan (71 batting) helped Himachal Pradesh seize the advantage after their side lost early wickets. Tamil Nadu had scored 225 in their first innings.

Raghav (191 balls, 11X4) held firm after the hosts resumed at 25 for 1, as the visitors looked to pick up quick wickets. G K Singh (8) was the first to go this morning as T Natarajan had him caught by B Indrajith.

Ankush Bains fell after after putting on 26 runs with Dhawan as he was bowled by Abhishek Tanwar for 8 to leave HP at 57 for 3.

Opener Raghav and N R Gangta (43) forged an important partnership for the fourth wicket to steady the ship. They added 74 runs in over 23 overs.

The exit of Gangta brought Raghav and the left-handed Kalsi together. They started cautiously but grew in confidence to thwart the Tamil Nadu bowlers. Their 90-run association for the fifth wicket brought the host back into contention as the TN bowlers tried hard to pull things back.

Later, the unbroken 119-run stand between Kalsi and Rishi, who has featured in ODIs and a T20 International for the country, took the game away from Tamil Nadu

After a period of circumspect batting, Kalsi and Rishi, especially the latter, took the attack to the rival camp.

Rishi looked in good touch, slamming 13 fours in his 82-ball knock of 71. Kalsi, on his part, has hit 15 boundaries so far.

Tamil Nadu skipper Indrajith tried seven bowlers but the HP batsmen were more than adept in handling their challenge.

Brief Scores (at end of day 2):

Tamil Nadu 225 all out in 78.4 overs (B Aparajith 53, Abhishek Tanwar 44, Dinesh Karthik 31, Pankaj Jaiswal 3 for 45) vs HP 340 for 5 in 88 overs overs (Raghav Dhawan 71, A R Kalsi 99 batting, Rishi Dhawan 71 batting, M Mohammed 2 for 67, T Natarajan 2 for 71).

At Visakhapatnam: Bengal 300 all out in 111.3 overs (Manoj Tiwary 90, Writtick Chaterjee 76, Pradipta Pramanik 43, Agniv Pan 39, K V Shasikanth 5 for 55) vs Andhra 108 for 2 in 43 overs (C R Gnaneshwar 64 batting, Jyothisaikrishna 43).

At Hyderabad: Hyderabad 317 all out in 109.3 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 60, Akshat Reddy 77, Himalay Agarwal 79, Mayank Markande 6 for 84) vs Punjab 202 for 4 in 68 overs (Anmolpreet Singh 85, Mandeep Singh 46 batting).

Manipur maul Arunachal Pradesh inside two days

Manipur crushed Arunachal Pradesh by 112 runs to wrap up the issue inside one and a half days in an early finish to their Ranji Trophy Plate Group fixture, in Kolkata.

A day after 23 wickets tumbled at the 22 Yards School of Cricket Ground at Saltlake, Manipur made 253 in their second essay to set a 273-run target for Arunachal Pradesh.

Shot out for their lowest total of 66 in the first innings, Arunachal Pradesh put up another insipid show with the bat to fold for 160, succumbing to their fifth defeat in six matches.

That their no 11 batsman Deendyal Upadhyay top-scored for 52 summed up the batting plight of Arunachal Pradesh.

The Arunchal Pradesh frontline seamer Upadhayay stood in their highest partnerhsip of 74 runs with Licha Tehi (26 not out) before being cleaned up by Thokchom Singh.

Upadhayay's stroke-filled 52 came off 50 balls with nine boundaries.

This was Manipur's third victory from six matches as they have 18 points, while Arunachal Pradesh who are yet to win a match have three points.

Earlier, resuming the day on 192/3 on a breezy Sunday morning, Manipur lost wickets at regular intervals and could add just 61 runs to their overnight total.

Debutant opener Hrithik Kanojia, who was overnight 79, missed a century by nine runs after being dismissed by Licha Tehi (3/74).

""I should have stayed longer. But luckily for us Arunachal Pradesh did not do well in the second innings too. I am happy that we won. But a century on debut would have been special,"" the 19-year-old from Delhi said.

Kanojia's 98-run partnership with captain Yashpal Singh (51) on the first day was a game changer in the low-scoring fixture.

""I think that was the turning point. Till then it was anybody's match,"" he added.

Thokchom Singh who clinched a careerbest 5/16 in the first innings for a match haul of seven wickets was adjudged man-of-the-match. Singh also chipped in with valuable 19 and 18 runs in the low-scoring tie.

Manipur coach Shiv Sundar Das said it was good to bounce back with a win after being bundled out for 88 in the first innings.

""The first two sessions on Friday was difficult. They have just started and have no experience of playing under these trying conditions. It's a good learning curve for the boys. Also Hrithik (Kanojia) and Yashpal Singh's partnership played a huge role. Hrithik batted really well and I am very happy for him,"" he said.

Surprised that the match ended before tea on the second day, Das said: ""It came as a surprise. But we will not complain.""

Ankit Kalsi, Rishi Dhawan duo steer Himachal Pradesh to strong 340/5 against Tamil Nadu

Ankit R Kalsi (99) closed in on his third first class century as Himachal Pradesh put up a strong batting show to extend their lead to 117 after ending day two of their Ranji Elite Group B fixture against Tamil Nadu at 340 for five, here Sunday.

Kalsi (99 batting), Raghav Dhawan (71) and Rishi Dhawan (71 batting) helped Himachal Pradesh seize the advantage after their side lost early wickets. Tamil Nadu had scored 225 in their first innings.

Raghav (191 balls, 11X4) held firm after the hosts resumed at 25 for 1, as the visitors looked to pick up quick wickets. G K Singh (8) was the first to go this morning as T Natarajan had him caught by B Indrajith.

Ankush Bains fell after after putting on 26 runs with Dhawan as he was bowled by Abhishek Tanwar for 8 to leave HP at 57 for 3.

Opener Raghav and N R Gangta (43) forged an important partnership for the fourth wicket to steady the ship. They added 74 runs in over 23 overs.

The exit of Gangta brought Raghav and the left-handed Kalsi together. They started cautiously but grew in confidence to thwart the Tamil Nadu bowlers. Their 90-run association for the fifth wicket brought the host back into contention as the TN bowlers tried hard to pull things back.

Later, the unbroken 119-run stand between Kalsi and Rishi, who has featured in ODIs and a T20 International for the country, took the game away from Tamil Nadu.

After a period of circumspect batting, Kalsi and Rishi, especially the latter, took the attack to the rival camp.

Rishi looked in good touch, slamming 13 fours in his 82-ball knock of 71. Kalsi, on his part, has hit 15 boundaries so far.

Tamil Nadu skipper Indrajith tried seven bowlers but the HP batsmen were more than adept in handling their challenge.

Brief Scores (at end of day 2):

Tamil Nadu 225 all out in 78.4 overs (B Aparajith 53, Abhishek Tanwar 44, Dinesh Karthik 31, Pankaj Jaiswal 3 for 45) vs HP 340 for 5 in 88 overs overs (Raghav Dhawan 71, A R Kalsi 99 batting, Rishi Dhawan 71 batting, M Mohammed 2 for 67, T Natarajan 2 for 71).

At Visakhapatnam: Bengal 300 all out in 111.3 overs (Manoj Tiwary 90, Writtick Chaterjee 76, Pradipta Pramanik 43, Agniv Pan 39, K V Shasikanth 5 for 55) vs Andhra 108 for 2 in 43 overs (C R Gnaneshwar 64 batting, Jyothisaikrishna 43).

At Hyderabad: Hyderabad 317 all out in 109.3 overs (Tanmay Agarwal 60, Akshat Reddy 77, Himalay Agarwal 79, Mayank Markande 6 for 84) vs Punjab 202 for 4 in 68 overs (Anmolpreet Singh 85, Mandeep Singh 46 batting).

A SpaceX rocket carrying a U.S. military navigation satellite blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on Sunday, marking the space transportation company's first national security space mission for the United States.

The Falcon 9 rocket carrying a roughly $500 million GPS satellite built by Lockheed Martin Corp lifted off from Cape Canaveral at 8:51 a.m. local time. Four previous scheduled launches in the last week, including one on Saturday, were canceled due to weather and technical issues.

The successful launch is a significant victory for billionaire Elon Musk's privately held rocket company, which has spent years trying to break into the lucrative market for military space launches dominated by Lockheed and Boeing Co.

SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 over the military's award of a multibillion-dollar, non-compete contract for 36 rocket launches to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed. It dropped the lawsuit in 2015 after the Air Force agreed to open up competition.

The next year, SpaceX won an $83 million Air Force contract to launch the GPS III satellite, which will have a lifespan of 15 years.

The satellite is the first to launch out of 32 in production by Lockheed under contracts worth a combined $12.6 billion for the Air Force GPS III program, according to Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder.

The launch was originally scheduled for 2014 but has been hobbled by production delays, the Air Force said.

The next GPS III satellite is due to launch in mid-2019, Eschenfelder said, while subsequent satellites undergo testing in the company's Colorado processing facility.

Anuj Rawat hit a brilliant counter-attacking hundred to nullify Avesh Khan's six-wicket haul as Delhi looked set for an outright win against Madhya Pradesh in a Ranji Trophy group league encounter on Sunday.

Wicket-keeper batsman Anuj scored 134 off 183 balls as Delhi scored 261 in their first innings in reply to MP's modest 132.

A first innings lead of 129 may well ensure full points for the home team.

The day belonged to left-handed Anuj, who played by far the most impressive innings of his nascent career so far.

""The innings came a few days late,"" he smiled sheepishly.

""I felt bad but the IPL snub has taught me that I need to work a lot harder. This is by far my best innings in senior cricket,"" said the former India U-19 keeper.

Delhi were reduced to 36 for 5, courtesy Avesh (6/51), who worked up brisk pace to unsettle the likes of Kunal Chandela (0), Dhruv Shorey (0), Nitish Rana (0) and Hiten Dalal (0).

Coached by Rajkumar Sharma (Virat Kohli's coach), young Rawat showed admirable temperament and proper game sense as he first consolidated with Lalit Yadav (25) in a 60-run sixth wicket stand.

Once Lalit was dismissed, Rawat found an able ally in Shivam Sharma (39), adding 118 runs for the seventh wicket.

Once Delhi got the lead, Rawat batted more freely hitting on both sides of the wicket.

He repeatedly reverse-swept leg-spinner Mihir Hirwani off the rough and for good measure hooked Kuldeep Sen for a six. He also hit a couple of sixes off left-arm spinner Kartikeya Singh.

Rawat is now getting a longer rope as Rishabh Pant is busy on national duty.

""Even if Rishabh Pant comes back, I want to score as many runs so that I can be picked purely as a batsman,"" said Rawat.

Another former U-19 player, who hogged limelight during the first half was Avesh, who is having a dream Ranji season so far with close to 35 wickets.

""The key to my success has been workload management. The support staff is ensuring that I don't bowl too much in the nets and have kept me fresh for matches,"" said the Delhi Daredevils pacer, who wasn't picked for India A this year.

Arguably it is a bit of both and the multiplier effect has resulted in the deafening of thought in sections of society.

Music legend Paul Simon, rather presciently in 1964, lamented about ""People talking without speaking; People hearing without listening"". Social norms, you could say, have evolved since, and if Sounds of Silence was re-recorded, Simon and Art Garfunkel would be singing, ""People talking without listening, people sharing without thinking..."" and of course, opining without knowing is emerging as the norm in any discourse in the polity. And it is not just in Parliament or among politicos. Discourse = people talking without listening.

On Monday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said economic incentives for investors will be linked to the political imperative of ensuring 70 per cent of the jobs went to locals. The statement triggered outrage online and offline. For starters, the qualification ""permanent resident"" is already a condition in many MP government ads. Anyway, Nath is scarcely the first chief minister to deploy the Thackerayesque line in politics -- founded by Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray, who used to call the Dadar-Madras Express the Stenographer Express, to build a locals-first cadre.

The bhumi putra condition is a preferred electorally profitable option across many states. In February 2018, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis declared that all new industries must ensure 80 per cent of the staff was local. In September 2018, Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani announced the state would pass a law to mandate 80 per cent jobs for locals. Karnataka, Jharkhand and Odisha are among states deploying the 'Employment of Local Persons' clause -- indeed Telangana has zones requiring 95 per cent jobs for locals.

The fact that 2.5 crore persons, more than the population of Australia, apply for 90,000 railway jobs symptomizes the magnitude of the job crisis. Should there be a quota for locals is a political question and the answer is contextually variable. One would expect that an economy which receives $80 billion in annual remittances from workers abroad would define a more nuanced approach. That is not the case. Almost every state, including Delhi, has blamed persons from UP and Bihar -- the Shiv Sena has literally chased and beaten up aspirants. It is natural for the politicos of Bihar and UP to protest. What is baffling is that the question, ""Why Bihar and UP lag in job creation"" is hardly aired or audible in the arena of anger.

Take the issue of rural distress -- the other passionately argued debate this week. It stemmed from the possibility of a national loan waiver for farmers. Typically the outrage is divided on binary lines. Those against the waiver/higher MSP/ income support ideas cite the impact on the fiscal deficit and the banking system and are okay with incentives to industry but not subsidies to farmers. Those for the intervention cite the '10 lakh crore bad loans basket as justification. To be sure there is a general consensus that waivers are not the answer, but the discourse does not extend to solutions.

What must be but is not adequately interrogated is why state after state and government after government is relying on band-aid economics to resolve a gigantic crisis with the potential to wreck the economy. After all, 49 per cent of the workforce living off 15 per cent of the national income -- that is Rs 22.77 lakh crore out of Rs 151.82 lakh crore, is hardly a recipe for the aspired 9 per cent growth.

The questions that need to be debated include why, despite the majority of MPs calling themselves farmers is the farm sector in such a rut? How much time do 4,000-plus MLAs devote to farm issues in the states? Why are reforms such as dismantling of APMC, introduction of lease agreements or contract farming opposed by the states?

In May 2017, the Niti Aayog under Arvind Panagariya released a 208-page three-year Action Agenda. This column weighed in on it and described it ""all agenda, little action"" (http://bit.ly/2pOwbqh). It is not known as to what is the fate of that agenda. Be that as it may, this week the Niti Aayog presented what it called Strategy for India @ 75. The headline aspiration indicated is for India to be a $4-trillion economy by 2022. It could serve as a useful revision of the gap between intent and implementation. Sherlock Holmes would have described it as a firm grasp of the obvious -- all intent and little strategy. It lists the need to raise savings and investments for growth, but the strategy is missing.

These instances reflect the missing the woods for the trees phenomenon in public discourse. For instance, on Friday, the issue of an order authorising ten agencies to intercept, monitor and decrypt private data was rendered into a whodunit of partisan blame. Increasingly, public policy rests more on individualised belief and less on institutionalised evidence. To paraphrase Nobel laureate Herbert Simon, the generation of rich rhetoric only results in poverty of attention and action.

Construction of a private railway siding for carriage of coal and oil fuel to Raghunathpur TPS, as described in the agreement between the Applicant and DVC, is a composite supply of works contract taxable @ 12% under Serial No 3(v)(a) of Notification no 11/2017-CT(Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

FULL TEXT OF ORDER OF AUTHORITY OF ADVANCE RULING WEST BANGAL

1. The Applicant, stated to be a Consulting Engineer rendering services related to engineering consultancy and monitoring agency to a large number of projects, both of the Government and of the Private Sector, seeks a ruling on whether the rate of GST for the construction of railway siding will be under Sl. No 3(v)(a) or Sl No 3(xiii) of Notification no 11/2017-CT(Rate) dated 28.06.2017 (and analogous notification issued under the WBGST Act), as amended, as applicable (hereinafter referred to as ""the Rate Notification"") under the CGST/WBGST Acts, 2017 (hereinafter referred to, collectively, as ""the GST Act"").

Advance Ruling is admissible under section 97(2) (a) & (b) of the GST Act.

The Applicant submits that the question raised in the Application has neither been decided by nor is pending before any authority under any provisions of the GST Act.

The officer concerned raises no objection to the admission of the Application.

The Application is, therefore, admitted.

2. The Application states that Damodar Valley Corporation (hereinafter referred to as ""DVC"") has appointed the Applicant as Project Management Consultant for construction of railway infrastructure, including commissioning of the railway system to handle coal and oil fuel traffic of Raghunathpur Thermal Power Station (hereinafter RTPS). The scope of work includes awarding contracts on behalf of DVC for construction of railway infrastructure. The work includes construction of a private siding between Joychandipahar and Bero stations in Adra division of SE Railway, enabling carriage of coal and oil fuel to RTPS.

The Applicant is responsible for passing the bills of the vendors and contractors after necessary scrutiny, and making the payments from a specially designated escrow account in which DVC deposits the requisite amount, and deduction of statutory taxes and deposit of the same, issuance of tax deduction certificates etc.

3. In support of his submissions, the Applicant has provided a copy of the agreement with DVC. It is an agreement to undertake Engineering and Construction Management Service for construction of Railway Infrastructure including commissioning of the railway system and advance procurement of railway section and P. way materials. The Construction Management includes procurement of Rails and PSC sleepers with fittings, points and crossings, track fitting etc, construction of railway formation and bridges and procurement of stone ballast as per specifications of the Indian Railways, laying of new P. way with Points and Crossings, procurement and installation of electrical equipment etc. Apart from track laying the work includes the cost of all civil work, signalling and telecommunication, overhead electrification and allied electrical work. The basic cost, including the Applicant's fee, for the project, is estimated to be Rs 496.69 crore.

The Applicant also provides a copy of an agreement with M/s Bridge & Roof Co Ltd - a contractor employed for execution of earthwork in railway formation, construction of minor and major bridges, p. way track linking work, including the supply of truck ballast and p.way fittings and fixtures etc. The contract price is Rs 70.99 crore. Evidently, it covers only a portion of the total project but can be relied upon as a specimen of the nature of the work being executed.

4. According to Serial No. 3(v)(a) of Notification No. 11/2017 - CT (Rate) dated 28/06/2017, as amended from time to time, the composite supply of works contract as defined under section 2(119) of the GST Act, supplied by way of construction, erection, commissioning, or installation of original works pertaining to railways, including monorail and metro, is taxable @ 12%.

Original work, as defined under para 2(zs) of Notification No. 12/2017-CT (Rate) dated 28/06/2017, means all new construction involving (i) all types of additions and alterations to abandoned or damaged structures on land that are required to make them workable, and (ii) erection, commissioning or installation of plant, machinery or equipment or structures, whether pre-fabricated or otherwise.

The term ""railways"" is not defined in the GST Act. It, however, is defined under section 2(31) of the Railways Act, 1989, meaning ""a railway, or any portion of a railway, for the public carriage of passengers or goods, and includes

(a) All lands within the fences or other boundary marks indicating the limits of the land appurtenant to a railway;

(b) All lines of rails, sidings, or yards, or branches used for the purpose of, or in connection with, a railway;

(c) All electric traction equipment, power supply and distribution installations used for the purpose of, or in connection with, a railway;

(d) All rolling stock, stations, offices, warehouses, wharves, workshops, manufactories, fixed plant and machinery, roads and streets, running rooms, rest houses, institutes, hospitals, waterworks and water supply installations, staff dwellings and any other works constructed for purpose of, or in connection with, railway;

(e) All vehicles which are used and any road for the purpose of traffic of a railway and owned hired or worked by a railway;

(f) All ferries, ships, boats and rafts which are used on any canal, river, lake or other navigable inland waters for the purpose of the traffic of a railway and owned, hired or worked by a railway administration,

(ii) Lines of rails built in any exhibition ground, fair, park, or any other place solely for the purpose of recreation.""

The Railways Act, 1989, distinguishes between, but covers, Government Railway under section 2(20) and Non-Government Railway under section 2(25) of the Act. It, therefore, includes scope for railways under both Government and private administrations.

5. It is evident from the above discussion that the scope of work, as outlined in the Applicant's agreement with DVC, is that of works contract, as defined under section 2(119) of the GST Act, fit to be called an 'original work' within the meaning ascribed to the term in para 2(zs) of Notification No. 12/2017-CT (Rate) dated 28/06/2017, and pertains to 'railways', provided it is meant for public carriage of passengers or goods.

6. Whether the phrase ""public carriage of passenger or goods"" prevents a private siding from being included in the definition of 'railways' has repeatedly come up for judicial scrutiny. The courts generally held that the phrase 'public carriage of passengers or goods' cannot be construed in such manner as to exclude from the ambit of 'railways' the sidings built and owned by organizations other than the government.

[Cases relied upon: DMRC -vs- Municipal Corporation of Delhi, 2008 (103) DRJ 369 (Delhi High Court); Commissioner, Central Excise, Raipur -vs- Anand Construction, 2017 (51) STR 435 (CESTAT, Principal Bench, New Delhi); SMS Infrastructure Ltd -vs- Commissioner, Central Excise, Nagpur, 2017 (47) STR 17 (CESTAT, West Zonal Bench, Mumbai)]

7. Art 366(20) of the Constitution excludes from the ambit of 'railway' only (a) a tramway wholly within a municipal area and (b) any line of communication wholly situate in one State and declared by Parliament by law not to be a railway. The Parliament excludes by law, apart from the tramways, the lines of rails mentioned under section 2(31)(ii) of the Railways Act, 1989, being rails built solely for the purpose of recreation. The term 'public carriage', therefore, cannot be given any meaning that may add more exclusion than specifically provided under section 2(31)(ii) of the Railways Act, 1989.

DVC - a public sector undertaking - is the owner of the railway siding being built. It is meant for carriage of coal and oil fuel to RTPS. The purpose of the carriage of goods is, therefore, not recreation, but producing public goods like electricity. It is, therefore, not excluded under section 2(31)(ii) of the Railways Act, 1989.

The construction of the private siding that the Applicant refers to, therefore, pertains to 'railways'.

Construction of a private railway siding for carriage of coal and oil fuel to Raghunathpur TPS, as described in the agreement between the Applicant and DVC, is a composite supply of works contract taxable @ 12% under Serial No 3(v)(a) of Notification no 11/2017-CT(Rate) dated 28.06.2017.

This Ruling is valid subject to the provisions under Section 103(2) until and unless declared void under Section 104(1) of the GST Act."

Other Decisions by GST Council -

Single cash ledger for each tax head - As of now there are various ledgers for each Tax heads Eg. For IGST the ledgers are - Tax, Interest, Penalty, Fees, Others. This creates a confusion as to which head to pay into and also sometimes results in mistakes and fund blockage. It seems that the intention is to have only 1 Ledger for each such tax head, Eg. IGST, CGST, SGST, UTGST & Cess

Relief for Claiming Refunds -

Single authority for disbursement of the refund - A major relief incase of refunds. Now CGST/IGST is paid by CGST Authority & SGST by SGST Authority. This creates unnecessary delay. This will now be done away with

Faceless refunds - All the supporting documents/invoices in relation to a claim for refund in FORM GST RFD-01Ashall be uploaded electronically on the common portal at the time of filing of the refund application itself, thereby obviating the need for a taxpayer to physically visit a tax office for submission of a refund application.

i) Refund on account of Assessment/Provisional Assessment/Appeal/Any Other Order;

Extension of Due Dates -

GST Annual Return & GST Audit Date extended till 30th June 2019 - Again a populist measure.

The due date for submitting FORM GST ITC-04 (FOR JOB WORK) for the period July 2017 to December 2018 shall be extended till 31.03.2019.

The due date for furnishing FORM GSTR-8 by e-commerce operators for the months of October, November and December, 2018 shall be extended till 31.01.2019.

Changes in Annual Return - Annual Return it seems will not only be a mere compilation of all returns but will include actual figures of Outward & Inward supplies

HSN code may be declared only for those inward supplies whose value independently accounts for 10% or more of the total value of inward supplies - While this gives some relief, yet it still remains a cumbersome job. A complete exemption from disclosure of HSN Code for inward supplies was expected

ITC cannot be availed through FORM GSTR-9 &FORM GSTR-9C - This fact is reiterated.

Additional payments, if any, required to be paid can be done through FORM GST DRC-03 only in cash

Also, the due date for furnishing FORM GSTR-3B and FORM GSTR-1 for the period July, 2017 to February, 2019/quarters July, 2017 to December, 2018 by such taxpayers shall be extended till 31.03.2019.

Waiver of Late Fees - Late fee shall be completely waived for all taxpayers in case FORM GSTR-1, FORM GSTR-3B &FORM GSTR-4 for the months / quarters July, 2017 to September, 2018, are furnished after 22.12.2018 but on or before 31.03.2019.

No E Waybills for Non-Filers -Taxpayers who have not filed the returns for two consecutive tax periods shall be restricted from generating e-way bills. This provision shall be made effective once GSTN/NIC make available the required functionality.

After more than a decade at Bayern, Ribery, 35, made another strong argument for an extension to his contract, which expires in June, with a double in Frankfurt having also scored in Wednesday's 1-0 victory over RB Leipzig in Munich.

Bayern broke through when Mueller found Lewandowski in the box and the Poland striker flicked the ball onto Ribery to tap home on 35 minutes.

Mueller hit the crossbar just before the break while Thiago Alcantara had appeals for handball turned down with 20 minutes left as Bayern maintained the pressure.

Ribery netted for the second time when he casually fired in off the post after exchanging passes with Joshua Kimmich on 79 minutes. Rafinha scored a minute from time when his cross-shot flew over Trapp's reach and into the Frankfurt net.

Klostermann thundered his goal in off the underside of the crossbar before Werner showed lightning-quick reactions to poach their second a minute before half-time after a disastrous back-pass by Bremen captain Max Kruse.

However, Kruse made up for his earlier error with his fourth goal of the season by blasting home on 67 minutes.

The American teenage international Josh Sargent then finished off a counter-attack to equalise with 13 minutes remaining in a tense finale. Leipzig were not finished, however, and Bruma coolly slotted in the winning goal between the legs of Bremen goalkeeper Jiri Pavlenka.

Schalke, who face Manchester City in the last 16 of the Champions League, are 13th after their first league win in five games with a 3-1 victory at Stuttgart as substitute Ahmed Kutucu made sure of the win with the Royal Blues' third goal 12 minutes from time.

Fortuna Duesseldorf built on Tuesday's shock 2-1 win over Dortmund with a 1-0 victory on the road at Hanover 96 with substitute Oliver Fink scoring their 92nd-minute winner to secure a third straight three points to lift them up to 14th.

Fortuna and Bayern are the only teams to have taken the maximum nine points from the three games in the last week.

Bayer Leverkusen are ninth after teenager Kai Havertz scored twice in their 3-1 home win over Hertha Berlin.

Bottom side Nuremberg are winless since late September after losing 1-0 at home to Freiburg, who took the three points thanks to a first-half header from defender Manuel Gulde.

A judgment is an authority for what it decides -- the ratio -- and not for what may logically follow from the decision. That's a settled principle of law.

In the case of Manohar Lal Sharma vs Narendra Damodardas Modi and other cases (the Rafale deal cases) the judgment of the Supreme Court pronounced on December 14, 2018, will be remembered more for the questions that the Court did not decide than for the questions that were decided.

The Court's approach was pretty simple and straightforward: there are severe limits to the Court's jurisdiction while examining a case of defence procurement. Lest the point was lost on the average reader, the Court concluded the judgment with the following words: ""We however make it clear that our views as above are primarily from the standpoint of the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 32 of the Constitution of India which has been invoked in the present group of cases.""

Limits of Jurisdiction

The lesson is clear: the petitioners erred in invoking the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 32 of the Constitution. Practically every conclusion declining to examine or decide the key issues in dispute followed from the conclusion regarding the jurisdictional limits of the Court. ""It was also made clear that the issue of pricing or matters relating to technical suitability of the equipment would not be gone into by the Court."" (Para 12.)

""...it is neither appropriate nor within the experience of this Court to step into this arena of what is technically feasible or not."" (Para 33.) Precisely for the reasons given by the Supreme Court, the Court ought to have, at the threshold, declined to entertain the petitions.

Dubious Claims/ Statements

There is another aspect of the judgment that is unusual. The Court seems to have 'accepted' whatever the government had stated either in the note in the sealed cover or in the oral arguments. Sample the following: that withdrawal of the original RFP (request for proposal) was initiated in March 2015; that the contract negotiations between Dassault and Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) could not be concluded on account of unresolved issues; that the Indian Negotiating Team had arrived at better terms relating to price, delivery and maintenance; the processes have been followed; a redacted version of the CAG's report was placed before Parliament and the report of the CAG has been examined by the PAC; the Chief of Air Staff communicated his reservation regarding the disclosure of the pricing details; the pricing details are covered by Article 10 of the IGA (Inter-Governmental Agreement) between the two governments; there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft; there were certain better terms in IGA qua maintenance and weapon package; Dassault was circumspect about HAL carrying out the contractual obligations; Dassault has signed partnership agreements with several companies and is negotiating with over hundred; there was possibly an agreement between the parent Reliance company and Dassault starting from the year 2012; and there has been a categorical denial from every side of the interview given by the former president of France, Mr Francois Hollande. None of these statements/ claims is entirely true and the Court, owing to its limited jurisdiction, did not examine their veracity. So, who can? The obvious answer is that only a parliamentary inquiry will expose the falsity of the statements/ claims and bring out the truth.

The forbearance shown by the Court has led the Court to commit an egregious error. There is no report of the CAG yet; no version of the report, redacted or otherwise, has been placed before Parliament; and the report has not been shared with or examined by the PAC. After misleading the Court, the government has conveniently blamed the Court for 'misinterpreting' its note! The government has also given lessons in English grammar to the Court! Those are the perils of adopting the 'sealed cover' approach. Unanswered Questions There are at least three big questions that can only be answered by a parliamentary inquiry.

Why did the government scrap the transfer of technology agreement and work share agreement (March 13, 2014) between Dassault and HAL when 95 per cent of the negotiations had been completed between the two (Dassault CEO, March 28, 2015, and Foreign Secretary, April 8, 2015)?

If the new price is cheaper by 9 to 20%, why did the government not buy the 126 aircraft offered by Dassault, since the Air Force desperately needs to augment its fleet of fighter aircraft?

Why did the government not push the case of HAL, the only company that has manufactured aircraft in India, for the whole or part of the Offset contracts?

Shop on Indian Railways trains! Looking to offer aircraft-like shopping experience to its passengers, Piyush Goyal-led Indian Railways has come up with a new initiative that will allow people to purchase items of day-to-day use. The provision to shop on board trains is likely to be introduced from January 2019. The Mumbai division of Western Railway is implementing the pilot project which may be extended to other trains across the network, based on the feedback from passengers. To begin with 16 Mail/Express trains have been shortlisted by the national transporter for which the contract has been awarded for 5 years to HBN Network Private Limited. The total contract is for Rs 3.66 crore, the payment for which shall be received on a quarterly basis.

Under the contract, the licensee has been allowed by Indian Railways to sell FMCG goods under the category of beauty, home & kitchen appliances and other fitness products. The sale of cigarettes, gutka, tobacco or any type of eatable will be not be allowed under the contract. Two sales staff will be deputed on the trains by the licensee with uniform, company ID and debit card machines. A ""shopping cart"" will be used by the licensee's staff to make the shopping experience easier and attractive for the passengers. Similar to the experience in aircraft, a catalogue will be distributed among passengers, allowing them to sift through the various options. The sales staff will then move through the train, selling items based on the demand.

Below is the full list of Indian Railways trains in which passengers can soon shop!

To avoid passengers from being disturbed, Indian Railways has restricted the time for sale of items from 8 AM to 9 PM. Additionally, the sales persons will not be allowed to shout or indulge in loud promotional activity on board the trains. The project will be implemented in multiple phases, with two trains (mentioned in the list above) being added every three months.

As a bonus for Indian Railways staff, there will be a 10% discount on all items in the shopping cart on production of a valid identity card!"

Mithali was in the news after falling out with Ramesh Powar, who was the coach of the team at the recently held women's World T20 in the Caribbean where she was dropped for the semifinal against England.

Their spat became public after both wrote to the BCCI and their respective letters got leaked.

But the selectors have reposed their faith on Mithali who retained her place in the T20 squad and captaincy for next month's tour to New Zealand.

The way things panned out was obviously not in a very good taste. It affected everybody in a different level, in a different way. Now I am sure things are settled and we should give more spotlight on the sport, on the players and in the team.Mithali Raj

Mithali said she and her family had to endure a lot of stress after her controversial exclusion from the playing XI during the semi-final of the Women's World T20 against England.

India lost the match and were knocked out of the tournament.

I can only say that the last few days were very stressful for me and my parents. It definitely did put women's cricket in the spotlight which was not needed. When you talk about non cricketing issues and not the team the focus goes away from the sport. Now that we have a tour (vs New Zealand), it's time that we move forward. Look forward and be more positive going forward.Mithali Raj

The rift between T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur and ODI captain Mithali was out in the open and the team was sharply divided into camps. While Mithali laid the blame of her exclusion on coach Ramesh Powar, Kaur said the decision was unanimously made by the coach, captain and vice-captain.

The team's senior-most member though is now ready to move past all the bad blood and start the tour of New Zealand on a positive note.

When the 15 individual players come together with the support staff, it's a huge and big family. There will be issues and it does happen. These issues are secondary to us... Not even secondary these things do not even come in the list of priority. But when we take on the field, we are ambassadors of the sport. On the field, we are one unit, we come as a team. We are there to give our best and perform as a unit.Mithali Raj

Following Mithali's complaint and also because his contract ran only till the WT20, Ramesh Powar was replaced as the coach by WV Raman who starts his tenure with the upcoming series.

""It's very early to comment on him. I had met him briefly at the National Cricket Academy. We have to support him and look forward to build a team.""

India are scheduled to play five ODIs and three T20Is in the tour beginning on January 24.

""We last toured there in 2007. Only Jhulan and I from the current team were part of the last tour. For many in the team it will be a first tour. It will be challenging. We should give more importance on the preparation. The priority will be to getting the team together,"" she said.

""The upcoming tour will be important. It's part of the ICC Championship one dayers and there's a point system in place. It's important for India to garner as many points as it will help us in 2021 World Cup,"" Mithali said.

Iraq's power sector is in disrepair and does not generate enough electricity to meet domestic demand. U.S. sanctions that went into effect in November have threatened to cut the country off from its chief supplier, Iran.

The US initially granted Iraq a 45-day waiver to allow it carry on buying electricity and gas from its neighbour while arranging for new suppliers.

Iraq will now have another 90 days where it can continue to pay for electricity imports, the State Department's public affairs office said. But it is barred from paying for gas imports, or it could face 'secondary sanctions' -- penalties for doing business with a sanctioned entity, Iran.

President Donald Trump moved to restore tough U.S. sanctions after withdrawing from Tehran's nuclear accord with world powers in May. U.S. sanctions targeting the country's energy and finance sectors went into effect in early November, ramping up pressure on Iran's economy.

The US is encouraging Iraq to break its dependence on Iran and develop its own gas and power generation sectors. Earlier this month, Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Iraq with a trade delegation from the Chamber of Commerce to promote US investment in Iraq's energy sector.

Meanwhile, nearby Qatar, already the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas, says it plans to increase gas production by 40 per cent.

Most experts, however, agree that Iraq will need at least a year to wean itself off Iranian energy imports, or risk worsening power outages. Electricity demand peaked at 24 gigawatts this year while domestic production was fixed at 16 gigawatts, leading to lengthy and unpredictable blackouts in the hottest months of summer.

The outages were one of the triggers to the unrest that shook Basra, Iraq's capital oil city, from July until September. Iraq has a contract to import 1.2 gigawatts of electricity from Iran, according to the Texas-based intelligence company Stratfor.

Iraq imports food and other goods from Iran, and the two countries keep close political ties. Trade between the two countries is expected to reach USD 8.5 billion this year.

The US granted eight other countries China, Greece, India, Italy, Turkey, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan 6-month sanctions waivers to give them time to reduce energy imports from Iran to zero.

""Rafale fighter jet deal is India's biggest defence scam and is an open and shut case of corruption. The Modi government is guilty of presenting falsehood to the Supreme Court and committing perjury as well as breaching the privilege of Parliament,"" Prakash told reporters here.

""The Modi government is shying away from constituting a JPC. Why? Because the one who had signed the deal will have to face the inquiry by the JPC,"" alleged the former AICC general secretary.

He alleged the Modi government had not only caused losses to the public exchequer, but also compromised national security.

""Modi is the champion in institutionalising corruption. He has done that in Gujarat by causing loss to state-run entity GSPC,"" the Congress leader claimed.

He said his party did not approach the SC over the contract as the party feels the court is not an appropriate forum to decide on issues of corruption, specifications, pricing and ""crony capitalism"" in the Rafale deal.

""This can only be done by a JPC. We have already made our stand clear in November. Even the apex court in its December 14 verdict concedes it is not an appropriate forum and can not decide issues of pricing, specifications and other technical matters,"" Prakash added.

Last Friday, the SC had dismissed the petitions challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets, saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision-making process"" warranting setting aside of the contract.

The apex court had rejected the pleas, which sought lodging of an FIR and a court-monitored probe alleging irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal, in which both the countries have entered into an inter-governmental agreement.

The Court had said that perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a ""fishing and roving enquiry"" by the court in such matters and it cannot ""sit in judgement"" over the wisdom of government's decision to go in for purchase of 36 aircrafts in place of 126.

It noted that process for procurement of 36 Rafale jets was concluded on September 23, 2016 and no questions were raised at that time and the petitions were later filed after reported statement of former French President Francois Hollande with regard to selection of Indian offset partners.

On the offset partner, the bench noted that this issue had ""triggered"" the litigation as petitioners had alleged that government gave a benefit to Reliance Aerostructure Ltd by compelling Dassault Aviation to enter into a contract with them at the cost of public enterprise, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).

""We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian Government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with the Indian Government,"" it said

Anantha Subbarao has demanded that the government merge all the four State-owned transport corporations -- KSRTC, BMTC, NEKRTC, and NWKRTC -- into a single entity for better management and services.

He said such a merger would help bring out the corporations from their financial crisis by drastically reducing operational and administrative costs and rationalising manpower. He was addressing a press meet in Kalaburagi on Friday.

""When the government decided to divide them into four corporations about 20 years ago, we strongly opposed the move. We knew it wouldn't help. Now, the experience over 20 years has proved that we were right. The cumulative losses that the four corporations have incurred in these years is over ₹1,477 crore. In addition to this, the outstanding debt burden is ₹944 crore. The total capital investment stands at ₹6,862 crore, of which the State government's share is ₹1,317 crore (19.2%). The remaining amount was mobilised from internal resources. If all the four corporations are merged, the operational and administrative costs will be reduced drastically and the manpower rationalised. It is the only way to save the crisis-ridden corporations,"" he said.

Condemning the Union government for its alleged ""anti-worker"" policies, including its initiatives to replace 44 labour laws into four codes, Mr. Subbarao said his federation, in its recently concluded sixth State conference in Kalaburagi, had resolved to actively participate in the all-India general strike, scheduled for January 8 and 9 next year.

""As part of its pro-corporate measures, the Union government is going to replace hard-earned labour laws with four codes. It essentially means more exploitation of workers with less job security. In order to register our protest, we will participate in the strike,"" he said. The labour leader added that the strike would also raise other demands such as raising the minimum monthly wage to ₹18,000, an old-age pension of ₹3,000 to everyone over 60, the abolition of contract labour system, and stopping of disinvestment of public sector units."

The Supreme Court had last week said there is no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the procurement of 36 Rafale jets from France, and dismissed all the petitions seeking an investigation into alleged irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal.

""A campaign on falsehoods, a campaign on lies till the time the Supreme Court came up with the verdict. Even after that, the Congress is not willing to accept the Supreme Court's verdict.

""Are they making the country believe that they are above the Supreme Court? The Congress approach was from the start to campaign on the basis of lies to mislead the people, and this was proved on the issue of Rafale,"" Sitharaman said.

She was speaking at the inaugural session of the two-day national convention of the BJP's women's wing here.

The Congress has repeatedly criticised the deal, alleging the Modi government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised during the UPA rule. The charges have been denied by the government.

Sitharaman said party workers, who are preparing for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, should understand that a ""political game is being played by the Congress leadership"".

""The Congress is still trying with all its might to remove the corruption-free NDA government. We will face this through constant campaigning with all our might to expose the falsehood of the Congress by presenting our truth. We should all work together for this,"" she said.

The minister asked women party workers gathered for the convention to brainstorm on the BJP's preparation for the upcoming general elections.

She said the BJP has been at the forefront of empowering women within the party.

On the other hand, the Congress was only ""doing lip service"" in the name of ""Women's Reservation Bill,"" that seeks to provide 33 per cent reservation to women in Parliament and state assemblies, Sitharaman said.

""We must remember that whenever there is a discussion on the Women's Reservation Bill, the Congress only does lip service. In 2008, the BJP was the first national party to have reservation for women from panchayat to national executive body.

""Other national parties joined later,"" she said, while counting the number of women chief ministers, governors, MPs, mayors, MLAs and ministers from the BJP across the country.

Sitharaman said she is a beneficiary of such a reservation in the party.

""I was given an opportunity by the party and I am trying to fulfil (the responsibility) with full dedication. You will get better opportunity,"" she told the gathering.

Sitharaman asked BJP workers to go among people and apprise them about the work done by the Modi government for women's empowerment.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, who was also present at the inaugural session, said the Congress was feeling ""overenthusiastic"" due to its victory in the just held assembly polls in three Hindi-speaking states.

This is why Congress leaders were ""misleading the country through lies"", he said.

""We should understand the importance of the 2019 elections. While the BJP wants to remove poverty, corruption, the Congress wants to remove the BJP.

""The BJP is committed to the upliftment of women. It has given many important portfolios to women,"" Rupani said.

AICC in-charge for the state Shaktisinh Gohil, however, said the party was making ""ground-level preparations in all 40 Lok Sabha seats"" in the state so that ""besides winning those we contest ourselves, we help our allies in achieving victory in their respective parliamentary constituencies"".

Gohil arrived here on his maiden visit of the state after the Congress-led UPA received a shot in the arm with the entry of Rashtriya Lok Samata Party chief Upendra Kushwaha, who quit the NDA and resigned from the Union Council of Ministers last week.

Gohil was present at a press meet in the national capital on Thursday with his party colleague Ahmad Patel, RJD Tejashwi Yadav, RLSP Upendra Kushwaha and HAM president Jitan Ram Manjhi.

He was asked about speculations that following its success in the assembly polls, the Congress could claim for itself the role of a ""big brother"" in the grand alliance, also known as 'mahagathbandhan'.

The grand alliance at present comprises the Congress, Lalu Prasad Yadav's RJD, the RLSP, the Hindustani Awam Morcha headed and founded by former Chief Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi.

""We are making preparations in all the 40 Lok Sabha seats. As regards to seat-sharing, an appropriate decision will be taken at an appropriate time. Our concern is not limited to increasing our own tally. We not only want to win our seats, but also want our allies to win in their respective seats. And the coalition is getting bigger, as you can see"", Gohil told reporters here.

The Congress leader, who is also an AICC national spokesman, came down heavily on the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, alleging purchase of the Rafale fighter aircraft at prices much higher than what was agreed on in 2012, by the then UPA government, had caused the exchequer a staggering loss of more than Rs 40,000 crore.

He also criticised the government for handing over the offset contract, worth Rs 30,000 crore to the Reliance Defence Ltd in place of the HAL, thereby ""sacrificing the interests of a public sector undertaking in favour of a private company"".

""In 2015, the Modi government went on to purchase 36 fighter aircraft, defence procurement procedure, defence exhibition council and cabinet committee on security were thrown to the wind"", alleged Gohil, who like the prime minister hails from Gujarat.

Reiterating the party's charge that the government ""misled the Supreme Court"" on the issue, Gohil said, ""The Congress has always held that the Apex court did not have the jurisdiction to investigate a scam of this nature. A reason why we have been pressing for a probe by a Joint Parliamentary Committee which the Modi government is wary of setting up"".

Training his guns at the Nitish Kumar government in the state, Gohil claimed the killing of a city-based businessman, Gunjan Khemka, in a crowded area of Vaishali district in broad daylight the previous day signalled the collapse of law and order in Bihar.

Similarly, it pointed out anomalies in the tourism offices in Tokyo where lack of monitoring led to losses of at least Rs 62.18 lakh and a loss of Rs 62.18 lakh at the ITO in South Korea for procedural lapses.

""The scale of malpractices in the ITOs indicates connivance of the officials of Ministry and, therefore, desire that the independent inquiry into the same may be conducted and those responsible be brought to book,"" the committee led by Mallikarjun Kharge said.

It further said the ministry of tourism had failed to monitor the ITOs adequately and suggested that a robust mechanism for the same be developed to keep a check on such anomalies.

""Regular monitoring including periodical inspections by the Ministry will act as a deterrent for unscrupulous elements,"" it said.

The latest move means he will remain in prison so prosecutors can question him further.

A towering figure in the auto industry, Ghosn has not yet responded to the latest allegation -- but he has consistently denied all earlier accusations made against him.

Ghosn spent the last month in prison, accused of misusing funds and hiding $80 million of income, according to the BBC. His detention rocked the global car industry and put strains on the alliance he presided over between Nissan and Renault.

On Thursday, a court rejected a request to extend his detention, signalling that he could apply to be released on bail.

But, by citing the new charges, prosecutors gained the right to hold Ghosn without bail for two days. They can then apply to the Tokyo District Court to extend that detention period by 10 days. That period can be extended once for a total of 20 days, according to Efe news.

Ghosn was indicted on December 10 on charges of underreporting his income on Nissan's financial statement over a five-year period ending in March 2015. At the same time, prosecutors cited new suspicions that he underreported his compensation for the three years ending in March 2018, using that as a basis to extend his detention without bail.

On Thursday, prosecutors suffered a rare loss after a judge rejected their request to hold Ghosn for 10 more days without the possibility of bail on the basis of those additional suspicions.

Ghosn's lawyer, Motonari Otsuru, filed a petition for bail after prosecutors lost the detention hearing, according to a person familiar with Ghosn's legal defence. The new suspicions came shortly before the scheduled bail hearing on Friday.

The new charges did not involve Greg Kelly, a longtime aide to Ghosn who was charged with helping underreport the auto tycoon's income.

The total investment could add up to around 60 billion yuan, or $9 billion, most of which would be shouldered by the Zhuhai government through subsidies and tax breaks, the Nikkei said, citing people familiar with the matter.

Zhuhai is a city in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong near to Macau.

The plans to build the cutting-edge plant comes amid the trade dispute between the U.S. and China, which includes concerns about China expanding the production of microchips.

Foxconn is expected to form a joint venture for the project with Japanese electronics group Sharp, which it acquired in 2016, and the Zhuhai government, Nikkei said, citing an industry source.

Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is planning to start the construction as early as 2020, the report said.

Representatives of Foxconn were not immediately available for comment.

Foxconn, the world's largest contract manufacturer, has been interested in the chip business, but many in the industry doubt the company has the resources to enter the field due to the high capital expenditures needed.

But Toshiba - which sold the chip business in June for roughly $18 billion and then reinvested $3.1 billion to gain voting rights - sees the stake as a boon.

The stake allows Toshiba to account for its former unit in its earnings, without having to further invest in it, CEO Nobuaki Kurumatani said in an interview.

""We're now in a position to benefit 40 percent of their profits while exempt from investment burdens,"" he said.

""I think we have an appropriate balance.""

Toshiba sold the business to a Bain Capital-led consortium that included South Korean rival SK Hynix, Apple Inc, Dell Technologies and Seagate Technology, to plug a multi-billion-dollar hole in its balance sheet after an accounting scandal and the collapse of its U.S. nuclear unit.

The company will reassess its plans for its stake in the chip business when Toshiba Memory's initial public offering (IPO) comes closer, Kurumatani said.

""We still have time to examine the situation with Chinese chipmakers and market conditions,"" he said.

The chief of Toshiba Memory had in September reaffirmed the company's plan to go public in two to three years, saying it had started preliminary work to prepare for an IPO, brushing aside concerns about weak fundamentals.

After a two-year boom in the market, oversupply is weighing on NAND flash chip prices amid weak consumer and business demand for phones and computers. NAND flash memory contract prices fell about 10 percent over July-September, according to market research firm TrendForce.

U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc recently forecast quarterly sales and profit well below market estimates. Hynix too has offered a gloomy outlook.

Market leader Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in October slashed 2018 capex by more than a quarter and warned of lower profit until early next year.

Samsung is also considering converting some of its NAND production lines to make DRAM chips next year. DRAM memory chips are used in servers, gaming PCs and cryptocurrency mining devices to process large amounts of data.

Shares of Samsung, Micron and Hynix have lost about 20-25 percent this year. Toshiba's stock has slipped just 4 percent, underpinned by relief over the chip unit sale and aggressive share buybacks.

The tax and other concessions demanded by them can be negotiated, he said, adding it is a good time for Apple to come to India, ""we will be very happy to receive them"".

The Cupertino-based iPhone and iPad manufacturer has asked for certain concessions for setting up its manufacturing unit in the country.

It had sought duty exemption on manufacturing and repair units, components, capital equipment and consumables for smartphone manufacturing and service/repair for a period of 15 years.

The company also wanted relaxation in the mandated 30 per cent local sourcing of components, besides reduction in customs duties on completely-knocked-down and semi-knocked- down units of devices that are to be assembled in the country.

Apple does not manufacture devices on its own but gets the job done through contract manufacturers. It sells its products through company-owned retail stores in countries like China, Germany, the US, the UK and France, among others.

It has no wholly-owned store in India and sells products through distributors such as Redington and Ingram Micro.

The appointment was made despite Committee of Administrators (CoA) being divided on the issue, with Diana Edulji asking chairman Vinod Rai to put the selection process on hold.

Raman, who played 11 Tests and 27 ODIs for India in the 90s was the obvious and unanimous choice of the panel once Kirsten refused to let go of his position as the coach and mentor of Royal Challengers Bangalore, as holding two positions amounts to a conflict of interest.

On Thursday, an ad-hoc panel comprising of former India captain Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad and Shantha Rangaswamy, interviewed 10 short-listed candidates.

Raman, who has been serving as the batting coach at the National Cricket Academy for two years now, has even stepped in as the coach of India U-19 side in Rahul Dravid's absence. Last week, he guided India to the final of Emerging Players Asia Cup.

With Kirsten ruled out, Raman was chosen as the ideal candidate as his reputation of being one of the best coaches in the domestic circuit found enough backing. The 53-yearold is expected to be in charge till 2020 World T20.

Though Kirsten was seen as the favourite, during his interview he refused to give up his position with RCB. As reported by this daily on Thursday, this is a direct conflict of interest as no person who is appointed as the coach of an Indian team can be a support staff of an IPL team.

He also runs an academy in Cape Town, which is against BCCI's policy on conflict of interest. On Thursday, when Kirsten was asked to give up his position as RCB coach, he said that there was no conflict of interest because it was a men's team and there was no way his position influenced his role with the national women's team.

Not convinced by his explanation, the ad-hoc panel referred his name alongside Raman and former India seamer Venkatesh Prasad to CoA to decide.

Once CoA referred Kirsten's issue to the legal team, it became apparent that he will be affected by a conflict of interest. Sources said that the team felt it was wrong even to shortlist him, as they felt that Kirsten should have been asked to make that choice earlier."

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

Kirsten, who shied away from many high-profile roles in India after the World Cup triumph, only making an exception for South Africa as he helped his country climb atop the world Test rankings, had only recently agreed to come on board with IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).

The BCCI, despite knowing that Kirsten was employed with RCB, still accepted his candidature and forwarded his CV to the three-member ad hoc panel consisting of Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad and Shantha Rangaswamy.

The panel did what it was asked to -- pick the best of the available candidates -- and Kirsten unanimously turned out to be the Number One choice. ""The presentation was exhaustive and extremely impressive. For the first time, Gary wasn't even considering bringing in his own support staff -- Paddy Upton and Eric Simmons -- like he had done back in 2008. He came with an open mind. He doesn't do it very often and there are many national teams which have experienced it. And what does BCCI do? Tell him he's conflicted?"" sources privy to the developments said.

The ad hoc panel shortlisted Kirsten, WV Raman (who was eventually appointed) and former pacer-turned-selector Venkatesh Prasad for the role and sent e-mails to the candidates in that order of preference. Kirsten's contract with RCB turned out to be a conflict for BCCI -- raising eyebrows across the fraternity -- before Raman, the next best candidate in terms of profile and presentation, was handed the responsibility.

""Who does these kind of things? When you're listing out the eligibility criteria, is it not your responsibility to let the applicant know if he's qualified to apply? You have Kirsten walking in and saying 'I want to work with women's cricket' and you say 'no'. Why? Because he's working with a T20 club and that too men? This is a joke,"" said an official.

The entire debate surrounding conflict in cricket has already stretched too far -- to the extent that BCCI has distanced India's own legends like Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Sourav Ganguly, Anil Kumble among others because they are employed in some other capacity or busy elsewhere.

But telling Kirsten on Thursday that he cannot work with the women's national team because he's working with a men's team in a T20 league has taken it to another level.

Those in the know of things told TOI that the three-member ad hoc panel too was left redfaced when they came to know that Kirsten could not be brought on board, despite them unanimously being in awe of the presentation he made during the interview process.

Sources say Kirsten's twomonth old contract with RCB happens to be a 'watertight' one, which he cannot give up on. Therefore, in the given circumstances, his decision turned out to be an easy one.

For a dwindling women's cricket circuit, that is still trying hard to be on par with men, letting go of Kirsten is a blunder."

Sasikala, an aide of former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and jailed in Bengaluru now, through video-conferencing in two cases booked by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA).

At 11 a.m., Sasikala appeared on screen before ACMM S. Malarmathy. A blue curtain was behind her. Jail superintendent of Parapana Agrahara prison and one more prison official were with her. Ms. Malarmathy was sitting with advocates of both sides and court staff in the video-conferencing facility.

Ms. Malarmathy said, ""Since there are certain errors in the procedure of framing charges which was done earlier, now we are framing charges afresh against you.""

She read out details of the cases against Sasikala and then the charges levelled against her.

When questioned, Sasikala denied the charges.

The case of ED is that Sasikala, as chairperson-cum-director of JJTV Private Limited, had authorised the company's managing director and her nephew V. Bhaskaran to negotiate and enter into a contract with any foreign supplier with a transponder facility for launching a Tamil satellite TV channel in the early 1990s.

The ED alleged huge payments were made to individuals in Malaysia and firms in U.S. and Singapore Dollars for hiring transponders and uplink facilities for JJ TV without getting permission of the Reserve Bank of India. They also procured equipment by routing money unauthorised channel. Sasikala is facing four cases- three with Mr. Bhaskaran and one more separately.

During the proceedings on Thursday, A. Asokan, counsel for Sasikala, contended that in the complaints filed by assistant director of ED, it was stated that the company was represented by Mr. Bhaskaran who was the MD.

""Therefore, question relating to the company can be asked only to Mr. Bhaskara,"" said Mr. Asokan. This stand was opposed by Hema, counsel for ED."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force will take its first delivery this month of the long-delayed KC-46 aerial refuelling tanker made by Boeing Co , people familiar with the process said.

Final paperwork has been moving through the Pentagon's chain of command in recent days, signalling that government concerns about the problem-plagued jet have been addressed after a multi-year delay, the people said.

The delays and fixes for the programme has been costly for Boeing, which recorded $176 million in additional charges on the KC-46 tanker in the third quarter alone. This brought the total pre-tax cost of the programme to more than $3 billion.

Delivery means Boeing could now begin to reverse what has been a steady stream of financial losses related to the KC-46 programme, and a major public relations headache for the world's largest aircraft maker. The acceptance will be final when Defense Secretary Jim Mattis signs off on the delivery.

The Air Force currently plans to buy a total of 179 of the tankers, and could receive them at a pace of about three jets per month to McConnell Air Force base in Kansas.

In September, Boeing said the KC-46 completed the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration certification, nearly three years after the planemaker commenced testing for the certification.

Boeing landed the $49 billion contract in 2011 to build the tankers based on 767 commercial jets.

""The KC-46 is a top priority for the Boeing Company, and we have the best of Boeing working to ensure the U.S. Air Force gets their tankers as quickly as possible,"" Boeing said.

An Air Force spokeswoman said ""We are working with Boeing to resolve deficiencies and move towards acceptance and delivery.""

Problems with the jet, which refuels other aircraft mid-air, revolved around the mechanism for delivering fuel and the operation of that device, known as a ""boom"".

Those issues have been mitigated in the eyes of the Air Force, the people said.

Boeing previously missed a forecast that the aircraft would be delivered last year, as the planemaker was trying to get airworthiness certifications and complete a flight test programme.

The deadline for both had been Jan. 21.

The announcement comes one day after the Treasury said in a statement it would lift sanctions on Deripaska's core empire, aluminium giant Rusal <0486.HK> and its parent En+

The U.S. Treasury had imposed sanctions on Deripaska, Rusal, En+, GAZ and other companies in which he owns major stakes in April, citing ""malign activities"" by Russia.

On Wednesday, it said Rusal, En+ and power firm EuroSibEnergo had agreed to restructure to reduce Deripaska's stakes, adding if Congress does not object the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) would lift the sanctions in one month.

But there was no mention of GAZ, Russia's largest producer of light commercial vehicles (LCV), leaving market players guessing over its fate.

""Talks (with OFAC over GAZ) are continuing, they are separate from talks on other Deripaska's companies as this (cars) is a different market and other players are interested in sanctions being removed,"" one of the sources said.

GAZ exports vehicles to over 25 countries outside Russia, and at home, its stake at the LCV market is around 50 percent.

GAZ has a contract manufacturing relationship with Germany's Daimler

A second source familiar with the talks said the main focus on getting sanctions lifted on GAZ was for it to mirror the shareholder changes which En+ had committed to undergo.

Under the deal with OFAC, Deripaska's stake in En+ will fall below 50 percent from 70 percent, with limited voting rights.

Two other sources familiar with the talks said the process may lead to GAZ selling some of its assets or a stake in itself, depending on how talks develop with the U.S. Treasury.

GAZ and Daimler declined to comment. Volkswagen said it was following developments closely.

""Volkswagen is in constant contact with the relevant departments for this purpose. It is crucial that we remain in a dialogue and do not slacken in our efforts to find a solution. In principle, Volkswagen AG complies with all existing sanctions,"" it said.

The fire at the ESIC Hospital in Marol, which has claimed 10 lives as of Thursday, was set off by sparks that flew from a welding machine and landed on a stack of rubber mats, the police investigation has revealed. The police are trying to trace and apprehend two welders, who have been missing since the day of the fire.

The fire broke out in the new, under-construction building of the hospital on Monday and spread to the old building. The flames and dense smoke sparked off panic among the patients, and many of them sustained injuries while trying to escape from the premises. The MIDC police on Wednesday arrested the site supervisor and his assistant employed by Supreme Constructions, which was awarded the contract for the construction.

According to the police officers, the firm's failure in adopting safety measures was the main reason for the tragedy and the high death toll. Navinchandra Reddy, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X), said, ""Two welders, who are now wanted in the case, were carrying out welding work to install air conditioning ducts on the first floor of the new building. Sparks from the welding machine kept falling on a large stack of rubber mats stored on the ground floor, triggering the fire.""

Mr. Reddy said that after the stack of around 30 to 40 mats went up in flames, dense smoke spread to the old building, causing panic among patients. The police said the bulk of the culpability lay on Supreme Constructions. Mr. Reddy said, ""The fire broke out in the new building which was under construction and not operational. The onus was on the contractor to ensure safety of the building in case of fire and other eventualities. There is no fire safety equipment at the site. We will be conducting inquires with the hospital authorities.""

The police have called in officials and staff members of the hospital for inquiries to find out if there was any negligence on their part that caused the fire."

He will take over the role from Ramesh Powar, who served on an interim basis - a relatively successful phase which ended with a semi-final loss against England in the recently-concluded World T20, followed by a to and fro of allegations with Mithali Raj.

Raman was among one of the three candidates shortlisted for the role by an ad-hoc panel to select the coach. The panel comprised Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad and Shanta Rangaswamy, and alongside Raman, the shortlist also included the names of former India coach Gary Kirsten and Venkatesh Prasad, which was sent to the Committee of Administrators and the BCCI.

While the order of preference went accordingly - Kirsten, Raman and Prasad, the former South African batsman refused to take up the offer as he wanted to continue in the coaching role with the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore, which would lead to conflict of interest. As a result, BCCI chose to go ahead with the next preferred candidate in Raman.

Explaining the process of shortlisting the candidates, Anshuman Gaekwad said, ""Even as there were several questions asked to the candidates, a few basic questions involved were coaching credentials, why they are interested, how do they plan to take the team forward and how many languages they can communicate in. We then also asked them about their expectations, what kind of support staff they would be needing etc. On the basis of that, we came up with our decision.""

However, there has been opposition from one quarter of the BCCI with regards to the process of selecting the coach. One of the BCCI officials argued, ""The entire process has gone ahead as per the whims and fancies of Mr Vinod Rai. When in a two-member panel, one person (Diana Edulji) wanted the contract of Ramesh Powar to be extended, how could Mr Rai go ahead and constitute a panel to select the coach? Wasn't there a deadlock? Was that the decision of a committee or an individual?""

ABOUT WV RAMAN

Raman is a former India batsman, who has played 11 Tests and 27 ODIs. His first-class career spanned from 1982 to 1999, where he represented Tamil Nadu.

He was a prolific run-getter for Tamil Nadu, scoring 7939 first-class runs. His prime came in the 1988-89 season when he notched up 1018 runs - a then record, which has been surpassed by only 15 other batsmen so far. He stroked up two double tons and a triple century that season.

His start to international cricket was good, top-scoring with an 83 and picking up a wicket in his first over against West Indies, in front of his home crowd in Chennai. He even became the first Indian to stroke an ODI century in South Africa.

Even as his international career was short-lived, he has been in the Indian coaching circuit for a long time, serving as the coach of Tamil Nadu (2005-2007), Bengal (2001-02, 2010-13), as the assistant coach with Kings XI Punjab (2013) and as the batting consultant of Kolkata Knight Riders (2014).

Since 2015, he has been working as the batting consultant at the National Cricket Academy. In this period, he has also played the role of a coach for various India A and Duleep Trophy and under-19 teams."

Criticising the Supreme Court judgement which dismissed the petitions challenging the Rafale deal, CPI(M) mouthpiece, Peoples' Democracy, in its latest editorial said the verdict is ""controversial"" and has put the court's reputation at risk.

In relief to the Modi government, the Supreme Court on December 14 dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision making process"" warranting setting aside of the contract.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said there has been a necessity of fighter aircraft and the country cannot remain without these jets.

The editorial is titled as: 'Rafale deal :A Controversial Judgement.'

""The Supreme Court Judgement by a three-member Bench on the Rafale Deal has become controversial even before the ink on the judgement has dried. Indeed, accepting notes in sealed covers, acceptance of government's arguments at face value, puts the court's reputation at risk,"" the editorial said.

It further said that the scope of judicial review was whether the defence procedures laid down were violated in the Rafale deal, and whether the Indian people have a right to know the price of defence deals.

""On both counts, the court has effectively said that it is not their task to do such a review, and accepted it as government's prerogative to keep the price of Rafale aircraft secret,"" it said.

The editorial was also critical of the government's move to file an affidavit on December 15 before the SC to make a factual 'correction' in a paragraph in the Rafale judgement in which a reference was made about the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report and Parliament's Public Accounts Committee (PAC).

""Is this a revision petition? And if it is, will others be heard in the petition? Or will the court cover its embarrassment and declare the petition to be only a grammatical correction of its poor English?

Stating that the procedures were not followed in the Rafale deal, the editorial compared it to the 2G scam under the UPA.

""That is why it was important for the Supreme Court to examine the procedural violations by the Modi government in the case of the Rafale deal, while examining how the price of the Rafale aircraft was arrived at,"" it said.

The Court had said that perception of individuals cannot be the basis of a ""fishing and roving enquiry"" by the court in such matters and it cannot ""sit in judgement"" over the wisdom of government's decision to go in for purchase of 36 aircrafts in place of 126.

It noted that process for procurement of 36 Rafale jets was concluded on September 23, 2016 and no questions were raised at that time and the petitions were later filed after reported statement of former French President Francois Hollande with regard to selection of Indian offset partners.

On the offset partner, the bench noted that this issue had ""triggered"" the litigation as petitioners had alleged that government gave a benefit to Reliance Aerostructure Ltd by compelling Dassault Aviation to enter into a contract with them at the cost of public enterprise, Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).

""We do not find any substantial material on record to show that this is a case of commercial favouritism to any party by the Indian Government, as the option to choose the IOP (Indian offset partners) does not rest with the Indian Government,"" it said.

""However, Mr Kirsten was unable to take up this assignment due to his ongoing contract with an Indian Premier League franchise, which would have entailed Conflict of Interest as per the BCCI constitution,"" the Board stated.

""Your unilateral decision of appointing the ad hoc committee is not only unconstitutional but also illegal,"" Edulji stated in her email to Rai, which is in PTI's possession.

However, Rai said that the appointment of coach was a must before the tour of New Zealand.

""It will be very unfair to leave the women's team in limbo without a coach when they are to embark on a foreign tour. We have had the benefit of a very distinguished panel of selectors who have interviewed very qualified applicants,"" he said.

Raman, who played 11 Tests and 27 ODIs, is now one of the most qualified coaches in the country. He has coached big Ranji Trophy teams like Tamil Nadu and Bengal, and has also had a stint with the India U-19 team.

From his playing days, Raman is best remembered for being the first Indian to score a century in South Africa during the 1992-93 tour.

Besides Kirsten, Raman and Prasad, the other shortlisted candidates out of the 28 applicants who were interviewed were Manoj Prabhakar, Trent Johnston, Dimitri Mascarenhas, Brad Hogg and Kalpana Venkatachar.

Kirsten was interviewed via Skype with four others while one interview was conducted over the phone. Raman, Manoj Prabhakar and incumbent Ramesh Powar appeared in person.

Kirsten, who had guided India's men's team to the 2011 World Cup triumph, was the number one choice but needed to step down from his RCB role to avoid a potential conflict of interest. BCCI CEO Rahul Johri even spoke to Kirsten and RCB officials but could not reach an agreement.

""Gary's contention was how can coaching a women's national team be a conflict of interest while being in charge of a men's IPL team. He could not be convinced on that. Having said that, Raman is a good choice as the team needs a batting coach at the moment. Prasad was number three in the pecking order,"" said the BCCI official.

The ad-hoc panel too made it clear to Kirsten that he would have to part ways with RCB to take up the national team role.

The Supreme Court-appointed COA has been divided over the coach selection process ever since fresh applications were invited.

While Edulji wanted Powar to continue at least till the New Zealand tour starting next month, Rai instructed the BCCI top brass to invite fresh applications.

Powar's controversial interim tenure ended on November 30 after a bitter fallout with ODI captain and senior player Mithali Raj over selection issues during the World Cup.

(File)

Thunderstorms forced Elon Musk's SpaceX to postpone Thursday's launch of a navigation satellite for the US military, which is the rocket company's first national security space mission for the United States.

SpaceX said its Falcon 9 rocket and payload, a roughly $500 million GPS satellite built by Lockheed Martin Corp, was ""in good health"" and that it would announce a new launch date.

""Standing down today due to weather,"" SpaceX tweeted minutes before the rocket's scheduled morning liftoff from Florida's Cape Canaveral.

The cancellation, which followed two previous launch attempts this week that were scrubbed for technical reasons, came as thunderstorms and wind gusts swirled around the launch site.

Patrick Burke, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland, said the weather might not clear up until Saturday.

A successful launch would be a significant victory for Musk, a billionaire and Tesla Inc chief executive, who spent years trying to break into the lucrative market for military space launches, long dominated by Lockheed and Boeing Co.

It would have marked SpaceX's first so-called National Security Space mission, as defined by the US military, SpaceX said.

SpaceX sued the US Air Force in 2014 in protest over the military's award of a multibillion-dollar, non-compete contract for 36 rocket launches to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed. It dropped the lawsuit in 2015 after the Air Force agreed to open up competition.

The next year, SpaceX won an $83 million Air Force contract in 2016 to launch the GPS III satellite, which will have a lifespan of 15 years.

The launch would be the first of 32 satellites in production by Lockheed under contracts worth a combined $12.6 billion for the Air Force GPS III program, Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said.

Air Force spokesman William Russell said: ""Once fully operational, this latest generation of GPS satellites will bring new capabilities to users, including three times greater accuracy and up to eight times the anti-jamming capabilities.""

The launch was originally scheduled for 2014 but has been hobbled by production delays, the Air Force said.

The next GPS III satellite is due to launch in mid-2019, Eschenfelder said, while subsequent satellites undergo testing in the company's Colorado processing facility.

"270","1023240624","2018-12-20","https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/weak-demand-falling-prices-signal-new-troubles-for-oilfield-services-1727847","Weak demand, falling prices signal new troubles for oilfield services","investing.com",FALSE,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The recent drop in U.S. oil prices to around $46 a barrel and insufficient demand are throwing into doubt the prospects for oilfield service companies in 2019 and may portend a wave of restructuring and consolidation of an industry still recovering from the 2014 downturn in energy markets.

Despite record U.S. oil production and exports, producers are reducing their spending and learning to do jobs with fewer crews. There has not been the wholesale staff cutbacks such as the ones that occurred three years ago, but investors and analysts expect consolidation in the services sector as work dwindles and share prices fall.

Even service companies that have strong businesses have been unable to get contract prices back to pre-crash levels. At onshore driller Scandrill Inc, all of its 15 rigs are active in U.S. oilfields. When two clients decided to stop drilling, new customers picked up the slack.

However, the rates that Scandrill charges for its rigs are below where they were at the depths of the 2014 oil price crash, said President Paul Mosvold.

""We won't see an increase in daily operating margin or the daily rig contracting rate soon,"" he said in a phone interview this month.

Some oil producers have cut services work. Diamondback Energy (N:FANG) this month released two of its 10 hydraulic fracturing crews and next year plans to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs, down from 24 rigs at work earlier this month.

Oilfield services company investors are cutting their holdings. The Philadelphia SE Oil Service Index (OSX), which tracks some of the largest oilfield service companies, this week fell below 81, the lowest since 2003 and below where it traded when oil prices crashed to near $26 a barrel in 2016.

With oil prices at their lowest level in over a year, the services sector should brace for a wave of restructurings and consolidation, analysts and attorneys told Reuters in interviews.

""The oilfield sector has the largest group of struggling companies within the energy industry. I think these companies need to consolidate, no matter what,"" said Sean Wheeler, a mergers and acquisition attorney at law firm Kirkland & Ellis.

Wheeler has been fielding inquiries from service providers wanting to evaluate options for restructuring if prices do not recover.

Contract driller Parker Drilling (PK:PKDSQ) in December filed for pre-arranged bankruptcy after failing to earn an annual profit since 2014, when oil prices started a long decline.

One problem is the number of companies operating in the market, attorneys and analysts said. Competition for fewer jobs is making it hard for service companies to raise prices - something that is benefiting shale producers.

""The availability of frac crews is great for us,"" said Bob Watson, chief executive of Abraxas Petroleum Corp (O:AXAS).

Watson said he was shocked recently when Abraxas received 15 bids for a one-well frack job in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.

""We got a very good price,"" he said. ""Things are slowing down on the completions side.""

The weaker outlook is pressuring shares of top oilfield firms. Schlumberger NV (N:SLB) and Halliburton Co (N:HAL) are trading below levels seen during the last oil-price downturn, and Weatherford International Plc (N:WFT) recently warned investors its shares could be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange if it can not lift its stock price above $1.

""There is a significant number of companies with liquidity and debt maturity issues,"" said Sajjad Alam, an analyst with debt ratings firm Moody's Investors Service."

He will take over the role from Ramesh Powar, who served on an interim basis - a relatively successful phase which ended with a semi-final loss against England in the recently-concluded World T20, followed by a to and fro of allegations with Mithali Raj.

Raman was among one of the three candidates shortlisted for the role by an ad-hoc panel to select the coach. The panel comprised Kapil Dev, Anshuman Gaekwad and Shanta Rangaswamy, and alongside Raman, the shortlist also included the names of former India coach Gary Kirsten and Venkatesh Prasad, which was sent to the Committee of Administrators and the BCCI.

While the order of preference went accordingly - Kirsten, Raman and Prasad, the former South African batsman refused to take up the offer as he wanted to continue in the coaching role with the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore, which would lead to conflict of interest. As a result, BCCI chose to go ahead with the next preferred candidate in Raman.

Explaining the process of shortlisting the candidates, Anshuman Gaekwad said, ""Even as there were several questions asked to the candidates, a few basic questions involved were coaching credentials, why they are interested, how do they plan to take the team forward and how many languages they can communicate in. We then also asked them about their expectations, what kind of support staff they would be needing etc. On the basis of that, we came up with our decision.""

However, there has been opposition from one quarter of the BCCI with regards to the process of selecting the coach. One of the BCCI officials argued, ""The entire process has gone ahead as per the whims and fancies of Mr Vinod Rai. When in a two-member panel, one person (Diana Edulji) wanted the contract of Ramesh Powar to be extended, how could Mr Rai go ahead and constitute a panel to select the coach? Wasn't there a deadlock? Was that the decision of a committee or an individual?""

ABOUT WV RAMAN

Raman is a former India batsman, who has played 11 Tests and 27 ODIs. His first-class career spanned from 1982 to 1999, where he represented Tamil Nadu.

He was a prolific run-getter for Tamil Nadu, scoring 7939 first-class runs. His prime came in the 1988-89 season when he notched up 1018 runs - a then record, which has been surpassed by only 15 other batsmen so far. He stroked up two double tons and a triple century that season.

His start to international cricket was good, top-scoring with an 83 and picking up a wicket in his first over against West Indies, in front of his home crowd in Chennai. He even became the first Indian to stroke an ODI century in South Africa.

Even as his international career was short-lived, he has been in the Indian coaching circuit for a long time, serving as the coach of Tamil Nadu (2005-2007), Bengal (2001-02, 2010-13), as the assistant coach with Kings XI Punjab (2013) and as the batting consultant of Kolkata Knight Riders (2014).

Since 2015, he has been working as the batting consultant at the National Cricket Academy. In this period, he has also played the role of a coach for various India A and Duleep Trophy and under-19 teams."

On December 14, the apex court dismissed all the petitions seeking probe into the Rafale deal stating that it was ""satisfied"" with the Central government's decision-making process.

Terming Rafael deal as the biggest scandal in the history of the country, Moily said, ""There are too many suspicions, questions on this deal but no answers have been given till now. Rafael deal was an open loot done by keeping the national security under risk. (Congress chief) Rahul Gandhi has taken it as a mission to fight against it and bring out the truth of the scandal.""

Moily also raised questions over the price of the fighter jets and said, ""Why BJP has purchased the Rafael fighter jets worth Rs. 526 crore at a price of Rs. 1600 crore? Why the contract was taken away from the HAL and given to Anil Ambani's Reliance? The original deal with HAL was for 126 Rafael jets in which 18 were to be brought in condition to fly and 108 were meant to be manufactured under HAL.""

Citing the Supreme Court verdict and subsequent submission of the central government application seeking a correction in the apex court's order, Moily said, ""The government has given false reports to the Supreme Court. The judgement is based on a nonexistent CAG report. Till now CAG reports are not submitted to Public Accounts Committee. Congress party is just demanding Joint parliamentary committee in this deal.""

Speaking to ANI, Moily asserted that the apex court has not given any clean chit to the government on different aspects of the deal.

""The Supreme court has not given clean chit on the pricing, technology, and work share contract of the Rafale deal. Prime Minister Modi has humiliated the country, he sacrificed the national interest. IAF Chief himself said that HAL is competent and today he says that the top court judgement was fine on the Rafael deal which means his opinion has no credibility,"" he added.

Addressing the media during his visit to Air Force Station at Jodhpur, Air Chief Marshal Dhanoa had said, ""The Supreme Court has given a very fine judgement and I am not going to comment on it. It has also said that this plane is badly needed. Rafale is always a need for the Air Force. It (fighter jets) took a long time to come. Others have upgraded their squadron. Also, very fine comments are given by the Finance Minister (Arun Jaitley) and our Defence Minister (Nirmala Sitharaman).

As always the kutcheris spill over into the lively sabha canteens. Drop in any time of day, and watch women draped in vibrant Kanjivarams and diamonds sharing tables with curious backpackers. Or elderly concert veterans explaining the intricacies of a raga to young music students.

Because if it's December and you live in Chennai, you must sabha hop. Both for the music and the city's unique sabha canteens. As the wedding season draws to a close, cooks and caterers move into concert venues. This was originally to fuel audiences, but the cheerful atmosphere and fresh, home-style cooking now draw everyone from early morning joggers craving crisp masala dosas to party-hoppers in the mood for a hot Horlicks sundowner.

For seasoned concert goers, this is the time to close down their kitchens, so they can try different canteens and the season's ever-changing menus. (Most canteens close by January 1, 2019). By the end of week one, which is where we are now, the favourites emerge. Where can you eat a full-fledged kalyana saapad? Which celebrity cooks are featured this year? Who is cooking where? And what should you order?

We have meticulously done the rounds (fuelled by copious amounts of kesari) to bring you this primer. Here is this year's list of must-visit canteens.

Ravi Chandran, a member of Narada Gana Sabha, says he realises that, ""Not everybody comes just for the kutcheri. So we ensure that our food is memorable."" For the past three years, Sri Sasthalaya Catering has been cooking at this sabha, popular for it's large airy pop-up canteen set at the back of the building.

""During Margazhi season, we have a lot of visitors, and if the performer is well-known then our canteen is filled with people, who come in to grab a quick bite or two,"" says K Ramesh of Sri Sasthalaya Catering.

The menu here changes everyday. With 50 people to manage the cooking and cleaning duties, the service is quick, polite and efficient. Yet, during weekends, they say they can't keep up with the demand, as people come pouring out from the hall straight into the canteen after each concert.

To ensure that rasikas don't miss the opening notes of any concert because of a tardy medhu vada, the staff have thoughtfully arranged separate stations, and ensured there are people manning each counter. ""People who want only coffee don't like to wait too long,"" explains Ramesh.

This year LV Pattappa takes over from Mint Padmanabhan at the Music Academy. Both are celebrated cooks, with well established catering services.

Set under a white canopy, the space looks calm in the morning. Pattappa's son, Balaji says ""Give it half an hour, and you will barely have space to move your chair."" The long tables, bedecked in clean white cloth, have a few lingerers still discussing the morning's concert over cups of filter coffee. Between a heated debate on the raga and how the artist presented it, plates of upma descend and all talks cease.

At the Music Academy, Pattappa focusses on traditional lunches served on banana leaves (₹ 300). The menu, changes everyday but always features a crowd pleaser, like the seppankizhangu (taro) roast. ""People keep asking when they will see that on the menu again, but we like to keep things interesting,"" says Balaji.

Curd rice served with puli inji is a hit. Also try their healthy tiffin menu featuring dosas, upma and payasam made with millets and ragi.

""People from neighbouring offices phone and ask for table reservations. I have to remind them it is first-come first-serve basis,"" smiles Balaji as customers begin to pour in.

In the canteen, decorated in maroon and gold, V Mahalingam, an organiser at Mylapore Fine Arts Academy, says ""Our caterer is well-renowned"". K Baskaran of Meenambiga Caterers comes from a legacy of culinary giants. His uncles are the famous 'Gnanambiga' Jayaraman, and 'Arusuvai' Natarajan. As for Baskaran himself, he has been in the catering field for more than 10 years.

""We generally do a traditional kalyana saapad (₹170) and change the menu everyday, but our speciality is tiffin,"" he says, adding with a grin, ""We frequently have to turn down outsiders, but that doesn't seem to stop them.""

Address: 45, Musiri Subramaniam Rd, Kattukoil Garden, Mylapore, Chennai -600004

While most sabhas rotate caterers every three years, the Mountbatten Mani Catering Service has retained this venue for the ninth year, making this a consecutive triple of their triple-year contract.

As they host artists from different states, K Srinivasan, who represents the catering service, says they keep the menu diverse. ""All the greats want variety,"" says Jagan, who supervises the canteen. Some of the most popular dishes here are karupatti paniyaram, thinnai paniyaram, jackfruit payasam, red rice kulaputtu and cashew mysorepak.

Picking up a menu and running his fingers down, as though in evidence, Jagan says, ""We have many, many dishes. You will not find this variety even in five-star hotels.""

Backed by a staff of 100, with 30 cooks and 70 helpers, the quality of the food is impressive. There is a live counter and the entire landscape of the tent is based on a theme every year. This year, it is inspired by agriculture. Despite the experimental watermelon rasam, chocolate dosa and apple bajjis, the traditional banana leaf lunch (₹400), comprising at least 17 different dishes, is what this canteen is best known for.

Highlights: Chocolate Dosa, jackfruit payasam, cashew and badam halwa, red rice kulaputtu

Japan's Nikkei shed 2.8 percent to close at its lowest since September 2017.

China's benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 fell 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, while the Hang Seng was off 1.1 percent.

In New York, U.S. S&P 500 Index lost 1.54 percent to hit its lowest level since September 2017. U.S. stocks are on pace for their biggest December decline since 1931, the depths of the Great Depression.

""I think the Fed may be underestimating other factors at play,"" said Bob Baur, chief global economist at Principal Global Investors in Des Moines, Iowa in the Unites States.

""Trade has been making headlines, but I think a gradual tightening of monetary policy has been the driving force behind recent market volatility. With corporate borrowing and spending still high, and the Fed continuing to reduce its balance sheet, I'd expect volatility to remain if this tightening continues,"" he said.

The Fed raised key overnight lending rate rates by 0.25 percent point as expected to a range of 2.25 percent to 2.50 percent.

It said ""some further"" rate hikes would be necessary in the year ahead, with its policymakers projecting two rate hikes on average next year instead of three they saw back in September, a change that was also largely in line with expectations.

But the slight revision was not enough to ease market fears over a further U.S. economic slowdown on the back of trade tensions, a waning boost from tax cuts and tightening monetary conditions for companies.

U.S. junk bonds sold off sharply, with their ETFs falling 0.9 percent, the biggest decline since March 1.

As investors flocked to the safety of government bonds, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to as low as 2.748 percent, a level last seen in early April.

A rise in short-term interest rates and a fall in the long-dated yield rekindled worries of an inversion in the yield curve, where shorter-debt yields become higher than longer-term ones.

Historically, an inversion between short-yields, such as three-month and two-year yields, and 10-year yields has been seen as a fairly reliable indicator of a recession down the road.

""We expect additional rate hikes will invert the three-months to 10-year yield curve which is a reliable signal for a bear market for stocks and a coming recession for both the U.S. and the rest of the world,"" said Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston.

""So, seriously something to keep a close eye on. We do expect a very difficult year for investors.""

The two-year U.S. yield stood at 2.654 percent, just 0.103 percentage point less than the 10-year yield.

As one 25 basis point rate hike would likely invert the yield curve, many market players are sceptical whether the Fed can raise rates at all next year.

Fed funds futures are now pricing in only about a 50 percent chance of one rate hike.

The dollar initially gained as the Fed was seen as more hawkish but it lost steam against other safe-haven currencies, such as the yen.

The greenback slipped 0.6 percent to its 7-1/2-week low of 111.865, while the euro also gained a tad to $1.1397.

The Chinese yuan weakened after China's central bank introduced a targeted lending measure on Thursday to support growth in a slowing economy.

The onshore yuan was trading at 6.902 per dollar, 0.1 percent weaker on the day, having earlier weakened to 6.915 per dollar.

On Thursday, Japan kept its policy settings unchanged, as expected.

Later in the day, UK and Sweden will make policy announcements. Both are expected to keep their policies on hold, though the Swedish central bank's decision is seen as a close call, with some analysts expecting a rate hike.

Oil prices fell on Thursday to erase most of their gains from the day before, resuming declines seen earlier in the week amid worries about oversupply and the outlook for the global economy.

The front-month U.S. crude contract dropped 2.1 percent to $47.18 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude futures were down 1.5 percent at $56.39 per barrel.

The front-month U.S. crude contract had dropped $1, or 2.08 percent, to $47.17 per barrel by 0742 GMT, offseting gains of 96 cents chalked up on Wednesday.

International benchmark Brent crude futures were down $1, or 1.75 percent, at $56.24 per barrel, after climbing almost 2 percent the session before.

""Wednesday's recovery was short-covering. Investors quickly moved their attention to deteriorating fundamentals in the oil markets including more signs of slowing economic growth next year, record production and the lack of confidence with OPEC's pledge to curb production,"" said Xi Jiarui, chief oil analyst at consultancy JLC.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices.

Oil prices are down more than 30 percent from peaks seen in October.

But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, said he expected global oil stocks to fall by the end of the first quarter, but added that the market remained vulnerable to political and economic factors as well as speculation.

Volatility in crude prices this week has driven investors to close their positions and is draining liquidity from the market, Xi said.

Total market open interest in U.S. crude contracts had fallen to 2.063 million contracts as of Thursday, up from a record of 2.71 million in May.

""It has been a tumultuous week in oil markets and traders may opt to shut it down after the last big risk event of the year with year-end position-squaring likely to kick-in today,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA.

Innes was referring to the U.S. Federal Reserve's last policy meeting of 2018, at which it suggested the U.S. economy no longer needed the central bank's support either through lower-than-normal interest rates or by maintaining a massive balance sheet.

But U.S. inventory data offered some support to WTI prices.

U.S. crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive fall.

Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, dropped by 4.2 million barrels, the EIA said, versus expectations of a 573,000-barrel increase.

Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel.

Special Judge Arun Bharadwaj granted relief to Prasad after he was produced before the court through video conference from a Ranchi jail, where he is lodged in another case, as he was unable to come due to health reasons.

The court directed both the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to file their replies to Prasad's application seeking regular bail in both the cases.

The cases relate to alleged irregularities in granting operational contract of two IRCTC hotels to a private firm.

The court had earlier granted regular bail to Prasad's wife Rabri Devi and son Tejashwi Yadav in the CBI case, while they are on interim bail in the ED matter, which was extended till January 19, the next date of hearing.

In its charge sheet, the CBI had said there was enough evidence against Prasad, Rabri, Tejashwi and other accused, including Additional Member of Railway Board B K Agarwal, who was then the group general manager of the IRCTC.

Delight Marketing Company, now known as Lara Projects, and Sujata Hotels Private Limited have also been named as accused firms in the charge sheet.

The CBI had registered a case in July last year and carried out searches at 12 locations in Patna, Ranchi, Bhubaneswar and Gurgaon in connection with the case.

The charges in the case include criminal conspiracy, cheating and corruption, the CBI had said.

According to the charge sheet, between 2004 and 2014, a conspiracy was hatched in pursuance of which BNR hotels of the Indian Railways, located at Puri and Ranchi, were first transferred to the IRCTC and later, for its operations, maintenance and upkeep, it was given on lease to Sujata Hotel Private Limited, which is based in Patna, Bihar.

It is alleged that the tender process was rigged and manipulated and the conditions were tweaked to help the private party - Sujata Hotels.

It also claimed that on February 25, 2005 Vinay Kochhar sold commercial property in the form of three acres of land in Patna through 10 sale deeds for Rs 1.47 crore to Delight Marketing, in which Sarla Gupta was a director as a front benami holder on behalf of Prasad.

Between 2010 and 2014, this land was further transferred, the CBI alleged.

In 2001, it was decided to handover the management of catering services of the Indian Railways, including of its hotels, to the IRCTC. Two such hotels -- BNR Hotels in Ranchi and Puri -- were also identified and a memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the railways and the IRCTC on March 19, 2004.

According to an FIR flied by the CBI, Prasad, the then railway minister, entered into criminal conspiracy with the owner of Sujata hotels, Sarla Gupta, the wife of his close associate Prem Chand Gupta, an Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MP in the Rajya Sabha, and IRCTC officials for ""undue pecuniary advantage to himself and others"".

The probe agency also alleged that BNR hotels were transferred to Sujata Hotels through a ""rigged and manipulated"" tender process managed by P K Goyal, the then managing director of the IRCTC.

The CBI enquiry shows that the railways sought bids for developing, operating and maintaining Rail Ratna Hotels on September 16, 2006.

The probe agency has alleged that Prasad was aware about the whole process and was keeping a track of the tender proceedings.

It surfaced that while over 15 bid documents were received for both the hotels, the IRCTC had no records of bidders other than Sujata Hotels.

It was also alleged that with an intention to render undue pecuniary gains to Sujata Hotels, the bid of another hotel was deliberately and unreasonably given low marks under technical evaluation.

""As a result, Sujata Hotels remained the only bidder in financial evaluation and was qualified,"" the CBI had alleged, adding that after the tender was awarded to Sujata Hotels, the ownership of Delight Marketing also changed hands from Sarla Gupta to Rabri and Tejashwi between 2010 and 2014.

However, Kumar parted ways from the RJD in July last year marking the end of Tejashwi's tenure.

Based on the CBI case, the ED also lodged a case of money laundering against Prasad, Rabri, Tejashwi and others.

U.S. stocks closed lower on Wednesday, 19 December 2018 after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference that followed the central bank's decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points, while lowering the median forecast for rate hikes in 2019 to two hikes from three previously.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 351.98 points, or 1.5%, to 23,323.66, while the S&P 500 index fell 39.2 points, or 1.5%, to 2,506.96.

At its highs early Wednesday, the Dow had risen 381.7 points, the S&P was up 39.13 points, while the Nasdaq had advanced 84.95 points at its peak. At its lows Wednesday afternoon, the Dow had fallen 513 points, the S&P 57.2 points, while the Nasdaq fell as much as 197.41 points at its nadir.

Every sector was driven lower after the Fed decision and they all ended the day in negative territory with losses ranging from 0.2% to 2.2%.

U.S. stocks fell sharply after the Fed announced its fourth interest-rate increase of the year, hiking the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%, and deepened those losses during a press conference where Powell explained the decision and accompanying forecasts.

The policy statement was perceived as slightly more dovish than the central bank's previous stance, as it modified its language to suggest it may be less aggressive in raising rates next year, while a survey of FOMC members shows the median voter expects two more rate hikes next year, rather than three hikes predicted at the Fed's September meeting.

Among stocks under focus, shares of FedEx Corp. closed 12.2% lower on Wednesday, after the logistics company announced Tuesday evening that it was lowering its guidance for 2019 and that it was starting a voluntary buyout program for some U.S. workers. Facebook stock was in focus after the New York Times reported that the company shared user data with large tech companies to a greater degree than it had previously disclosed. The stock fell 7.3% Wednesday.

The Federal Reserve on Wednesday, after gold futures settled, said it decided to hike its target for the federal-funds rate by a quarter point to a range between 2.25% and 2.5%. The central bank also said, however, that it has now penciled in two rate hikes in 2019, not the three moves seen in September, and it still forecasts just one more hike for 2020.

Reviewing today's economic data, which included Existing Home Sales for November, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and the Current Account Balance for Q3, existing home sales increased 1.9% month-over-month in November to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.32 million (consensus 5.20 million). Total sales were 7.0% lower than the same period a year ago. The key takeaway from the report is that while sales have now increased for two consecutive months, the trajectory remains challenged by higher mortgage rates and limited affordability. The weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index fell 5.8%, compared to the 1.6% increase in the prior week.

Separately, the current account deficit for the third quarter totaled $124.8 billion (consensus -$126.0 billion). The second quarter deficit was revised to $101.2 billion from $101.5 billion.

Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Wednesday, 19 December 2018. Gold prices climbed on Wednesday, holding ground at their highest finish since July, then pulled back in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision to lift a key interest rate, as had been expected.

Ahead of the Fed news, gold for February delivery on Comex rose $2.80, or 0.2%, to settle at $1,256.40 an ounce. That was the highest finish for a front-month contract since 10 July 2018. Prices have gained about 2.4% month to date. March silver SIH9, -1.03% added 11.7 cents, or 0.8%, to $14.818 an ounce.

Crude oil futures finished higher on Wednesday, 19 December 2018 buoyed by a third straight weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies and a drop in distillate stocks, after a price plunge a day earlier pushed the U.S. benchmark down to its lowest finish in nearly 16 months.

January West Texas Intermediate crude rose 96 cents, or 2.1%, to settle at $47.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a high of $48, with the contract paring some of its earlier gains after the Federal Reserve announced its decision Wednesday to raise a key interest rate, as expected. The contract settled at $46.24 a barrel on Tuesday, the lowest finish for a front-month contract since Aug. 2017. The January futures contract expired at the day's settlement. February WTI crude which is now the front-month contract, settled at $48.17, up $1.57, or 3.4%.

The sell-off in the stock market prompted a flight to safety in U.S. Treasuries, pushing yields lower. The yield curve also flattened with the Fed-sensitive 2-yr yield losing two basis points to 2.64%, and the benchmark 10-yr yield losing five basis points to 2.78%.

Looking ahead, investors will receive weekly Initial and Continuing Claims, the Philadelphia Fed Index for December, and the Conference Board's Leading Economic Index for November on Thursday.

However, the documents show for the first time that some discussions about compensating Ghosn out of the public eye were not confined to the Japanese carmaker, but also included Renault executives.

Ghosn's undisclosed Nissan income is at the centre of allegations by Tokyo prosecutors against the alliance chairman, who has been charged with failing to disclose $43 million in compensation for 2010-2015 that he had arranged to receive later. Since 2010, Japanese firms have been required to disclose details of executive remuneration including stock options and bonuses when the total exceeds 100 million yen ($890,000).

The plans, which were considered in 2010 and 2017, sought to find legal channels through which Ghosn could receive undisclosed payments.

In a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday, Renault said it had ultimately responded that any such pay ""would have to be made public in France."" It added: ""To the best of Renault's knowledge, this project was never implemented.""

Ghosn and Greg Kelly, a Nissan director, are still in custody and have had little opportunity to defend themselves in public.

Ghosn, who remains Renault's chairman and chief executive, denies that the alleged pay deals broke any laws, his Japanese lawyer has told other media. Japanese media have also reported that Kelly has denied the allegations. U.S. representatives for Ghosn and Kelly declined to comment.

Reuters reviewed internal emails and invoices related to the projects and spoke to people with direct knowledge of them.

Executives, including Renault's general secretary Mouna Sepehri, worked on a proposed 2010 plan to create an additional source of compensation for Ghosn through the alliance's Renault-Nissan BV (RNBV) Dutch holding, according to an internal email seen by Reuters.

In the April 22, 2010, email to Sepehri and one other recipient identified only as Scott, Kelly wrote: ""I greatly appreciate the work you have done to analyse whether part of the CEO's compensation can be paid by RNBV without disclosing it publicly.""

""I have reviewed all of the information you have provided me with the CEO and have explained to him that there are good legal grounds for RNBV being able to pay ... part of his compensation without having to publicly disclose the amount,"" Kelly wrote.

Kelly's email was unearthed by the Nissan investigation of Ghosn.

Kelly had ""consulted several people at Renault and Nissan to establish whether it was legally possible that part of the CEO's compensation be paid by RNBV to reflect the time he spent working on alliance synergies,"" the company said.

Renault owns 43.4 percent of Nissan, whose 15 percent stake in its French parent carries no voting rights. Nissan, in turn, controls Mitsubishi Motors Corp <7211.T> via a 34 percent holding. Their combined 10.6 million vehicle sales rival Volkswagen and Toyota.

Nissan now wants to examine the finances of jointly owned RNBV and other alliance entities. Renault, whose biggest shareholder is the French state, has so far ignored its request for an independent investigation.

In 2017, as deferred Nissan income owed to Ghosn continued to mount, alliance executives tried another approach.

Renault-Nissan bankers developed plans to pay millions of euros in undisclosed bonuses to Ghosn and other alliance managers via a Dutch service company. On June 13, 2017, Reuters reported details of the plan contained in an eight-page document. Two days later at Renault's shareholder meeting, Ghosn denied that such a plan existed.

""There is no truth in any of this,"" Ghosn told shareholders at the meeting, as Renault deputy CEO Thierry Bollore and Sepehri looked on. ""I can tell you that every week we get proposals from consultants and banks at my level.""

The plan was scrapped soon after that, invoices and emails show.

According to documents reviewed by Reuters, Bollore and Sepehri were among a small group of executives included in emails and meetings about the bonus plan, along with Hiroto Saikawa, now Nissan's CEO.

Reuters could not establish what roles the executives played in the planning process.

Both carmakers declined to make the three executives available for comment.

On July 25, 2017, financial adviser Ardea Partners, which had worked on the plan, billed Renault-Nissan $1.5 million, plus $49,219.57 in expenses, for ""services rendered."" That was half the $3 million fee that had been agreed in a May 13 contract seen by Reuters, drawn up as the project moved towards implementation, and payable on completion.

Renault told Reuters its executives had not led the project. ""On certain subjects there were exchanges with some Renault and Nissan executives, including Mr Saikawa, Mr Bollore and Ms Sepehri,"" it said.

Nissan, which is pressing Renault for a joint investigation of alliance finances, also wants to re-examine a recent decision to create a new alliance foundation in Switzerland.

In a Sept. 26 resolution seen by Reuters, the Renault-Nissan board signed off on a 30 million-euro ($34 million) transfer to the organisation, documents show.

The transfer was approved by 10 alliance executives including Ghosn, Bollore, Sepehri and Saikawa. But it was cancelled after Ghosn's Nov. 19 arrest in Japan, before the cash was moved, two sources said.

SHGs are already serving MDM to students at many schools run by the Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC). Though eager to outsource it to SHGs, schools do have apprehensions about accountability in the way the system will be run. TOI has learnt that the issue will be discussed in the principals' association meet in January.

A principal of an aided school told TOI on condition of anonymity that the idea of outsourcing was not a bad one considering the hassles schools have to deal with. ""We have to coordinate with the officials who deal with MDM and maintain records of each and every transaction plus students fed. One of the office staff is continuously engaged in this operation only, so one would feel that it's best to hand outsource this operation,"" the principal said.

TOI has been told many schools are being urged by MDM officials to select SHG as their vendors. The principal, added "" I hope the money and raw materials are properly accounted for. Pilferage can happen very easily with the school not being directly involved.""

The current set up for aided schools is such that schools get rice directly from the government. The rice sacks are delivered every month straight to the campus from Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns, with no monetary exchange happening between schools and FCI. The quantity of rice sacks to be delivered is conveyed by the school to the education department, which then informs FCI about it. This is the only part of the purchasing process that is common for both urban and rural schools.

Vegetables, pulses and other cooking materials have to be purchased by urban schools which then get reimbursed within two or three months. In rural areas, schools have to simply pick up the ingredients from designated shops and the education department takes care of the payment.

Almost all rural schools have cultivated kitchen gardens and use fresh vegetables in their MDM. Apart from SHG, even NGO Akshay Patra is providing MDM to certain schools as pilot project."

That caution reflects a broader threat to Beijing as it looks to stimulate a slowing economy with increased infrastructure approvals: private builders - the backbone of the sector - are less willing to take projects on due to higher risks and lower profits.

""In the past, once there was an opportunity, we would rush to grab the work. But now we're more choosy: Are we able to undertake it? Do we really want to do this? We want to lower our risks,"" Cai, a wiry and sprightly 63-year-old, told Reuters at his office in the eastern Chinese city of Nantong.

Construction projects have taken longer to start and complete, due to increased environmental regulations, work suspensions and growing liquidity pressures, Cai and other industry executives told Reuters.

While investment as a proportion of China's economy has been trending down as services and consumption rise, it still contributed to about one-third of the country's economic growth last year.

China poured billions of dollars into building roads, rail-lines and other infrastructure to prop up the economy during the global financial crisis in 2008 and has routinely returned to use it as a driver of growth. However, analysts say that its effectiveness has been increasingly dulled with rising debt risks and inefficient projects.

Beijing began tightening approvals for infrastructure projects last year and ordered an overhaul of its public-private partnerships programme as part of its efforts to tackle debt risks.

Infrastructure spending growth slowed to 3.7 percent in November, near its lowest level in two decades, from levels of over 20 percent last year.

And downward pressure on the economy is increasing, China's statistics bureau said on Friday.

(GRAPHIC: China's builders under pressure, https://tmsnrt.rs/2PwBJiG)

Larger listed builders are feeling the pinch. A Reuters analysis of the earnings of 82 listed Chinese construction and engineering firms found total debt grew at its slowest rate in at least six years between July to September, illustrating the difficulties they face in obtaining financing.

These companies include Jiangsu Zhongnan Construction Group <000961.SZ>, which saw its total debt contract by just over 10 percent over the period. Like a large number of Chinese companies, its controlling shareholder has in recent months been pledging its shares to finance firms to raise cash.

Meanwhile, third-quarter revenues rose at their lowest pace in six quarters, underlining the pressure on sales.

State-owned giants such as China Communications Construction Corp <601800.SS> <1800.HK> and China State Construction Engineering Corp <601668.SS> build the country's largest projects but work also filters down to private firms, which make up about 90 percent of China's 86,000 construction firms, according to the China Construction Industry Association.

Adding to those strains are China's effort to clean up the environment, which builders say has pressured some materials producers to shut plants and others to stop work when pollution levels are high, curbing output and pushing up prices.

Prices of materials, which can account for about 60 percent of a building's cost, have risen 29 percent between the first quarter of 2016 to the third quarter this year, according to Joe Chan, Head of China East at consultancy Arcadis.

Cement production, for example, has dipped, driving Chinese firms to start importing from places like Vietnam which saw cement exports to China jump by over half this year.

""The situation is new for the cement industry for China,"" said Raluca Cercel, an associate at consultancy CW Group, who estimates average cement prices have risen to over $50 a tonne from less than $30 a tonne in 2016. ""Supply is definitely declining faster than demand is.""

Zhao Yingtai, the owner of another Nantong-based construction firm, said supply shortages and rising prices were impacting timely completion of projects.

""Now the cement companies are choosing who they want to supply to,"" he told Reuters. ""This has meant that our work can't progress on schedule, which causes delivery problems which in turn can become a liquidity issue.""

The government is taking steps to mitigate these pressures.

Since July, it has restarted greenlighting a number of large railway and airport projects as a trade war with the United States threaten to trigger a sharper slowdown.

Beijing has also said it will relax restrictions to allow local governments to sell special bonds to pay for projects and has pledged more financing support to cash-strapped firms.

Authorities also started probing the steep price rises of sand, cement and concrete in September, an official from the China Cement Association, who declined to be named, told Reuters, confirming recent domestic media reports.

The National Development and Reform Commission did not respond to a request for comment.

However, industry insiders said they believe the pressures will last for at least another year and any funding from the Beijing will take some time to filter down to smaller firms. State firms, which tend to have easier access to capital, will likely shoulder the lion's share of the work in the meantime.

Cai, for instance, is now looking elsewhere for profits. He has set up a separate company to trade construction materials, taking advantage of ties he has with cement suppliers and the high prices.

""Trading is still risky,"" he said. ""However it saves on labour and is less troublesome.""

The MIDC police on Wednesday arrested two people in connection with the fire at the ESIC Hospital in Andheri that claimed nine lives on Monday.

Police officials said an FIR was registered against four employees of Supreme Constructions, the company that had the contract for the expansion of the hospital building. ""We have booked the accused for causing death by negligence and endangering life or personal safety of others along with relevant sections of the Maharashta Fire Security and Safety Act,"" Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone X) Navinchandra Reddy told The Hindu.

The arrested accused are Nilesh Neta, the site supervisor in charge of the project, and his assistant, Nitin Kamble, who was in charge of wiring and electrical work. Two welders, whose alleged negligence caused the fire to break out, have also been named as accused and are expected to be arrested by Wednesday night or Thursday morning, officers said.

""The welding work was being carried out without any fire safety precautions. For now, those who were found to be directly responsible for the fire have been named as accused. Inquiries are under way to find out who else was responsible, including the hospital staff,"" a police officer said.

"301","1022435352","2018-12-19","http://risingkashmir.com/news/fixed-term-employment","Fixed-term employment","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"Due to the changing circumstances, organizations around the world are experiencing an increased level of economic strain and the academic organizations are no exception.

These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output.

One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as contractual. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department.

This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors.

Although, these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, for example, Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc.

According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment.

It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfilment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.

It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees.

The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies.

Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker; and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees. The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand.

Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labelled these employees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfil the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements, and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labelled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment.

Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors.

But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees.

Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, for example, evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc.

Being labelled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee.

The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction.

The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly bureaucratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately.

The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach) of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees.

Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorismwas considered obsolete by 1930s and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfil their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world, we are not able to fulfil even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse.

And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanent staff members.

These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labelled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public.

When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions.

Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrolments.

These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind.

The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will be further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees.

The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers' account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paid neither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.

It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom and many of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences.

The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"".

Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to them has resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments.

Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

One staffer said that, as the test was not monitored, some also pooled their answers with friends at ""pizza parties"" in front of a large screen, according to a posting on an ECB intranet forum.

The test, which is supposed to assess a candidate's ability to process information, has been used by the ECB to sift mass applications for junior roles, most recently as bank supervisors.

The ECB told staff this month it would ditch the test's provider, a UK firm called Team Focus, and discard the latest results after answers were found online.

""We regret to be in a situation in which the cheating behaviour of some candidates has an impact on (other) candidates.""

But this was more than two years after staff representatives first flagged a risk, including in a meeting with chief supervisors Daniele Nouy and Sabine Lautenschlaeger in January 2017.

Candidates could create fake accounts to gain access to the questions ahead of time, or get someone else to answer in their stead, the representatives said in a letter dated October 2016.

Emmanuel Larue of trade union IPSO told Reuters: ""With this test cheaters were rewarded and that's not a risk the ECB can take.""

The bank has been asking candidates to take a new test on its premises, the ECB said in the intranet posting.

A spokesman added the institution would now work with a different provider ""using enhanced security features"".

The ECB has made no announcement regarding people who had already been hired using the test, nor did the spokesman say how many jobs were awarded using it.

The central bank hired 639 people on fixed-term or temporary contracts last year.

The contract awarded to Team Focus was worth between 800,000 euros ($915,240) and one million euros plus VAT, according to a notice on the ECB's website.

German online travel agent VIR is a joint complainant with ETTSA in the case. The association's other members are Odigeo, Opodo, bookers, eDreams, Sabre, Travelport and hotels.com, among others.

""LH (is) leveraging its dominant position on air transport services markets in Austria and Germany to control and manipulate the present and future distribution channels for LH and ultimately other carriers' tickets,"" the association said in its complaint. It said this penalised EU consumers in the short term as well as in the long run.

The Commission confirmed receipt of the association's complaint against Lufthansa, saying that it would assess it carefully.

Lufthansa said: ""Indeed, we have officially been informed today about the complaint from ETTSA filed to the European Commission. Of course, the Lufthansa Group will cooperate with the investigating authorities.""

Expedia said it supported the complaint because it was concerned about the carrier's conduct.

The association said Lufthansa does not make available its cheapest fares, such as basic tickets which do not include fees for checked-in luggage or a reserved seat, on certain flights to global distribution systems (GDS) providers.

""As the next cheapest tickets are regularly around 20 percent more expensive than those reserved to Lufthansa's direct channels, this measure has the effect that when a customer searches on a price comparison site, LH.com always appears as the cheapest option,"" the association said.

It also alleged that Lufthansa levies unjustified surcharges on rival travel agents and forces them to use its own technological distribution systems instead of competing systems.

The complaint focuses on Lufthansa's flights to and from its hubs in Frankfurt, Munich, Vienna and Zurich, and its subsidiaries Brussels Airlines, Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines.

ETTSA's grievances against Europe's largest airline date back to 2015, when Lufthansa started charging a fee for tickets booked through third parties in a bid to boost profits and have more say over its prices.

Lufthansa sells around 70 percent of its tickets via third party channels using GDS from Amadeus, Travelport, Sabre and other providers.

Amadeus and Sabre are themselves being investigated by the EU over contract terms that the antitrust watchdog says could prevent airlines and travel agents from switching to rival ticket agents.

ETTSA had previously complained about Lufthansa's surcharges to the Commission's transport department, saying that these breached the EU's code of conduct on computerised reservation systems. The department has sent a pre-rejection letter, with a final decision on whether to dismiss the complaint due early next year.

Sentiment remains negative, however, as investors grapple with weakening demand and worries about oversupply.

Brent crude futures rose $1.61 to $57.87 a barrel, a 2.9 percent gain, by 11:03 a.m. EST (1603 GMT). The front-month U.S. light crude contract, which expires on Wednesday, rose $1.56 to $47.80 a barrel, a 3.4 percent gain. The second-month contract rose $1.53 a barrel.

Crude inventories fell by 497,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 14, smaller than the decrease of 2.4 million barrels analysts had expected. The decline was the third consecutive decrease, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said.

Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 4.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 573,000-barrel increase, the EIA said. Distillate demand rose to the highest since January 2003, which bolstered buying, particularly in heating oil futures, the market's proxy for diesel.

Heating oil futures gained 3.3 percent to $1.8106 a gallon.

""The complex is piecing together a modest advance so far today but only one that offsets a miniscule portion of recent losses,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

The markets slumped on Tuesday, extending a recent run of poor performance. Global benchmark Brent tumbled 5.6 percent on Tuesday, just above a 14-month low reached during the session, while WTI lost 7.3 percent, its lowest since August 2017.

Broader financial markets have been under pressure on worries that higher U.S. interest rates could slow domestic growth.

The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. The central bank is due to announce its decision at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT).

Both Brent and WTI have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of October as crude supply has increased.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers including Russia agreed this month to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices.

But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Notably,Punjab cabinet had in October approved a new mining policy in which it had given go ahead to major policy changes to enable the government to grant contracts by auction of mining blocks in strategically established clusters through progressive bidding instead of the earlier process of auction by individual mines.

When turned out to be a third-time demolition by Mourinho's personal Baba Yaga/Boogeyman - Jurgen Klopp, who has hastened his departures at Real Madrid and Chelsea as well.

The moment that perhaps best epitomised Mourinho's - chicken running hither thither- reign came in the 83rd minute with Man Utd 3-1 down at Anfield.

Fellaini, the man Mourinho throws at every problem, had the ball in Liverpool's final third but instead of shooting towards goal or anywhere in that particular vicinity, he managed to pick up a steward sitting near the corner flag.

That moment of complete absurdity probably showed Mourinho's time at United, a bunch of overpaid players with no clear plan of action, crucified by their manager week in and week out. Now he will probably spend Christmas checking all the zeroes in his bank balance, after Man Utd were forced into a very premature golden handshake that will leave Mourinho at least 15 million pounds richer.

By the end of it, the only thing entertaining were his pressers.

In his last conference as Man Utd manager, he went on to praise the Liverpool players to high heavens, while stating that his team just didn't have the quality. He went on to suggest that his Porto, Inter and Real players were much better than this United squad.

Perhaps he already knew his time was up. Mourinho spent the last of his regime in constant moaning mode, complaining about everything. The man who Manchester United picked to halt the rise of their Noisy Neighbours failed miserably.

While it might be tempting to lay the blame completely on Mourinho for Manchester United's descent to mid-table mediocrity, the powers-that-be at Old Trafford, particularly vice-chairman Ed Woodward has a lot to answer.

As former coach and player Brian McLair wrote that Mourinho shouldn't be the only one to leave.

That sums up the problem at Old Trafford since Ferguson left, with Ed Woodward looking more like a brand manager out to monetise a commodity than the man in-charge of the world's most popular football club.

Woodward's misses

Former CEO David Gill and Ferguson's double retirement met that there was a sudden vacuum at the top at Old Trafford which Ed Woodward has been unable to fill.

The first mistake was appointing David Moyes instead of Jose Mourinho. Mourinho should've been the Chosen One, not Moyes whose CV had nothing to suggest he was up to the ginormous task of succeeding the greatest British manager of all time. By the time he came along, the problems had stacked up.

As many commentators have pointed out, the six-year contract that David Moyes was handed still isn't over and some of the blame has to be shared by Ferguson, who was given the leeway to choose the next manager.

Ferguson, despite his attempts at continuity, failed to groom a successor at Old Trafford. None of his players went on to become top managers with the likes of Roy Keane and Mark Hughes rising highest but still failing to ever manage a top club. Moyes came, replaced the backroom staff, and left everyone alienated.

Ryan Giggs could've been ready if didn't keep playing till the age of 40. The other option was to blood an in-house manager like former assistant manager and current Iran Coach Carlos Queiroz but that plan also failed

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer - the manager who has been handpicked to be interim in-charge - has only managed Molde in Norway and had a dismal time at Cardiff City where he lasted only nine months.He might be a treble-winning hero and a great finisher but it's very hard to see if he can make heads turn and convince the world's best players to sign for United.

The way the news leaked - thanks to an update on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's profile page on the official website - suggests that at United, the left hand doesn't know what the right is doing.There were no teary goodbyes from any of the players except for a giggling Paul Pogba, who put up a cheeky social media post before deleting it, suggested that his Instagram game has a lot more flair than his footballing skills at the moment.

The breakdown with Pogba represented one of Mourinho's biggest challenges, a World Cup-winning midfielder who looked like he had two left feet when he played for him. Mourinho, it was believed wanted to transfer both Pogba and Martial, a move opposed by the current regime.

But if that was the case, why give Mourinho a contract extension in the first place?

A scatter-gun transfer approach, keeping on a manager clearly not gelling with his players or with the ethos of Manchester United and then failing him to back him in the market are all inexplicable footballing decisions. Also, Manchester United was a club that did things with class. Yet the abrupt and impersonal manner in which Mourinho was fired, as were his predecessors Louis Van Gaal and David Moyes, suggests that the powers-that-be at Old Trafford lack the class that defined this squad.

Fans might be happy to see Mourinho's back, but it's quite unlikely that the troubles at Manchester United are over."

The European Commission set out its contingency plans in the event of Britain crashing out of the bloc next March without securing a divorce settlement and transition period.

""If the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified, financial operators established in the United Kingdom will lose, as of the withdrawal date, the right to provide their services in the EU27 member states under the EU financial services passports,"" it said in a statement.

Brussels said it was only taking preventive action to ensure EU customers could continue clearing derivatives transactions at UK operators like LCH for a year from March, and use central securities depositories in Britain for two years.

""The commission has concluded that EU27 companies need this time to have in place fully viable alternatives to UK operators.""

It also gave EU market participants time to shift derivatives contracts from Britain to the EU without being caught up in with margining requirements.

""For their part, clients in the European Union of UK firms need to prepare for a scenario in which their provider is no longer subject to EU law,"" the commission said.

This contrasts with Britain's decision to offer broad access for banking, insurance and other financial services from EU firms in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The Bank of England wanted EU contingency plans to include legal ""continuity"" of cross-border insurance contracts.

""While the action on derivatives is welcome it is extraordinary that the EU authorities will act to help major financial institutions, but not millions of ordinary people living in Europe whose insurance and pension contracts happen to be held in the UK,"" said Hugh Savill, director of regulation at the Association of British Insurers.

Catherine McGuinness, leader of the City of London financial district, said the commission also needed to address significant ""cliff edge"" risks for data transfers and contract continuity for uncleared derivatives.

Markus Ferber, a senior member of the European Parliament's economic affairs committee, said actions on derivatives will not be enough as the question of legal liability remains unanswered.

""The European Commission has to disclose the underlying cooperation agreements with UK supervisors. Furthermore it has to answer the question if and up to what level the European Central Bank will have to provide emergency liquidity assistance in a crisis scenario,"" Ferber said.

Many financial firms in Britain are pushing ahead to open new hubs in the bloc before March to ensure continuity of services for EU customers, irrespective of what form Brexit takes.

Fulfilling franchisee fee of Rs 15 crore is one of the criteria.

While the AIFF has been looking to merge the two domestic leagues, there are a number of issues that need to be addressed.

The arrival of Quess as sponsors has given East Bengal financial boost while Mohun Bagan are in talks with ATK to collaborate.

""Talks are in advanced stages between Mohun Bagan and ATK,"" a source monitoring the development said.

National team coach Stephen Constantine's contract runs till January 19, 2019 and Das said the performance of the national team in the AFC Asian Cup and the coach's wish will be taken into account when the time comes for renewal.

With plenty of optimism after an impressive run, the Indian team is leaving Thursday to play Oman in an international friendly on December 27, entering the final phase of preparation for the Asian Cup. The continental showpiece will be held in the UAE from January 5 to February 1.

The team is likely to play a club side based in the Gulf on December 30.

Ahead of the team's participation in the Asian Cup, AIFF president Praful Patel termed the country's fourth participation in the AFC tournament a ""precursor to India's goal to achieve a berth in the FIFA World Cup by 2026.""

""The Asian dream needs to be achieved by 2026 as there will be eight teams from Asia in the FIFA World Cup,"" Patel said at a press conference after a kit launch of the team.

""You just always cannot live a dream and we have to make the Asian dream a reality. And with the form the national team is in, and if Sunil Chhetri and everybody can pull their feet together, we can make it a reality,"" he added.

The Indian team had earlier participated in the Asian Cup in 1964, 1984 and 2011 editions.

""We should always go for the maximum and we should try to win the tournament, let alone get out of the group stages,"" Patel stated.

""We are mentally and physically prepared. We wish the team all the very best and they have the full support of the AIFF.""

""The reasons that we have qualified for the AFC Asian Cup 2019 is because players like Sandesh Jhingan, Gurpreet Singh Sandhu, Anirudh Thapa, Jeje and Udanta Singh and all others. It is because of these players that I go on the pitch without any pressure. They do all the hard work while I just tap the ball in,"" Chhetri said.

""We have three games from January 6-14 and I am focusing on them. We will take one game at a time and we have scouted Thailand intensively to the point that we have watched them 3-4 times for analysis,"" he informed.

""We look forward to make India proud,"" Constantine added.

Chhetri stated that ""India will be looking to get no less than three points against Thailand"".

""I was involved in the mock draw that happened for the Asian Cup and I was wondering what team we could draw. I knew whichever team that we drew, it would be difficult for us.

""But now, we are ready to face anyone. We are well prepared and looking forward to the challenge,"" Chhetri said.

Comparing India's preparation to the one in 2011, Chhetri added: ""In 2011, we were together for six months. But this time of the year, all the boys that have been selected are playing constantly in the Indian Super League and the I-League.

""Now we just have to come together as a single unit and give it our best shot when we get to UAE.

""I try my best to motivate the team like players like Rennedy Singh, Abhishek Yadav, Surkumar and Bhaichung Bhutia did in 2011. I believe that actions speak louder than words and we have come to a time where one player pushes the other to excel,"" he quipped.

Constantine said the team has ""enough time to acclimatise"".

""We have tried our best to prepare in the best possible fashion. We wanted to play big teams and strong teams like we did against China, Jordan. We next play Oman on December 27. We have got the right amount of competition to build us and are ready.""

""The committee is aghast to note that the CCTV surveillance system could not be made operational due to non-receipt of sufficient quantity of Common Wealth Games (2010) items for three years between July 2012 and June 2015,"" it said in a report presented to the Lok Sabha on Wednesday.

The panel said it was ""dismayed"" that while leftover CWG equipment lay idle for so many years, the Delhi Police procured CCTVs causing double loss to the government exchequer.

""The audit observed that the Delhi Police and the Ministry of Home Affairs failed to assess and determine the technical requirement for CCTV surveillance systems in high-security areas, which resulted in a CCTV surveillance project awarded in February 2013 for New Delhi and central districts remaining incomplete as of October 2017, despite an expenditure of Rs 42.94 crore,"" the panel said.

The project was approved by the Home Ministry to use 1,888 surplus CCTV cameras and associated equipment leftover from the CWG items in the surveillance system of the Delhi Police across its policing jurisdiction to monitor and resolve crimes and address security challenges.

The contract for supply, installation and commissioning of the CCTV surveillance system in high-security areas here was awarded to the Electronics Corporation of India Limited in February 2013.

It was to be completed within 150 days of receipt of road cutting permission from civic agencies for the respective sites.

The PAC has also found that employees in some offices in Delhi Police submitted LTC claims with inflated air fares in violation of government orders.

""These were passed without due scrutiny resulting in irregular reimbursement amounting to Rs 2.56 crore to 435 employees,"" it said.

The committee noted that the government of India has permitted all employees, including non-entitled employees, to travel by Air India to the northeast and by any airline to Jammu and Kashmir on LTC in 2008 and 2010, and the facility was extended from time-to-time.

The air tickets for travel on LTC were to be purchased either directly from the airlines at booking counters, through their websites or by utilising the services of authorised travel agents.

""The committee observed that on scrutiny of travel details of 1,196 employees of the Delhi Police, it was found that in case of 435 employees, air tickets had neither been directly purchased from the airline nor from the authorised travel agents,"" the report said.

It said airfare amounting to Rs 2.56 crore claimed by these employees and reimbursed by the Delhi Police was also higher than the cost of tickets shown on the website of airlines and charged from these employees. These employees had not submitted original tickets of the airline and the airfares claimed ""appeared to be inflated"", the report noted.

However, the claims were allowed by the authorities concerned without exercise of due diligence and without ensuring compliance with the extant instructions, the panel said.

Eastern offshore KG-D6 block, once considered the most prolific in India, had courted controversies when allegations of gold-plating or inflating the cost were levelled against RIL when it had in 2007 revised estimated investment to USD 8.836 billion from USD 2.47 billion proposed in 2004, and then failed to deliver on the promised output.

It brought in caution in the establishment and demands for the appointment of an independent validation when RIL in December 2009 submitted a field development plan for four satellite gas discoveries in the same block.

The optimized field development plan (OFDP) was approved by block oversight panel, called Management Committee (MC), which is headed by Director General of the Directorate General of Hydrocarbons (DGH), in January 2012.

""The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas had directed DGH to engage a third party for validation of capex but no third party could be engaged and the MC approved OFDP without waiting for the decision of MoPNG in this regard,"" the PAC said in a report tabled in Parliament Wednesday.

It did not agree with the ministry's submission that actual capital expenditure gets independently validated when the annual accounts are audited and the cost recovery is restricted to actual expenditure irrespective of the estimates projected by an operator.

""In the opinion of the Committee, the reply of the Ministry renders the whole process of validation of estimates, plans etc. redundant. Further, when the Ministry had asked for independent validation, the direction should have been followed scrupulously and the Ministry instead of accepting its lackadaisical monitoring and taking action against the MC is giving lame excuses,"" the report said.

The PAC felt that the decision of not appointing the third party for validation could be deliberate so that the ministry gets flexibility in the decision making.

""The Committee desires that the decision for not appointing the third party for validation may be inquired into and disciplinary action taken against the officers found responsible,"" it said.

It did not accept the ministry's submission that ""the MC was to approve the development plan as per the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) timelines and since no third party could be appointed, the proposal was approved without third-party validation based on consensus decision of DGH.""

RIL had in July 2008 submitted a development plan for nine satellite gas discoveries for approval of the MC which it found unviable at the then prevailing gas price of USD 4.2 per million British thermal unit. Subsequently, in December 2009, RIL submitted an OFDP for four satellite discoveries which after considering changes in certain assumptions was approved in January 2012.

The USD 8.836 billion cost was for Dhirubhai-1 and 3 gas fields, the first two of the 19 discoveries in the block. The cost for four satellites was additional and was to produce 10.36 million standard cubic metres per day of gas by 2016-17 but the start of work was delayed because of technical and commercial factors. Gas is now expected by 2022.

The PAC went into the 2011 CAG report that castigated the Petroleum Ministry for allowing RIL to retain its entire eastern offshore KG-D6 block in contravention of the PSC. The PAC submitted its first report in April 2016 in which it had stated that exploration cost on unviable finds cannot be disallowed.

In the second report on the subject tabled in Parliament Wednesday, the PAC asked the government to bring out a comprehensive policy on how discoveries can be declared commercially viable. ""Constant efforts may be made to cut down procedural delays especially wherever huge financial implications are involved,"" it said.

It also wanted timelines for approvals to be prescribed and internal controls adequately strengthened.

The PAC was, however, critical of inordinate delays in submission of final action taken replies on its April 2016 report.

""The Committee is dismayed to note the callous attitude of both Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Ministry of Law and Justice in the delayed submission of Action Taken Replies and opine that instances of such nature should definitely be obviated in future,"" the report said.

Government auditor CAG did not say in its September 2011 report if the capital expenditure for KG-D6 being raised from USD 2.4 billion proposed in 2004 to USD 8.8 billion in 2006 was unjustified or inflated.

In the global commodities markets, Brent for February 2019 settlement was up 34 cents at $56.60 a barrel. The contract slumped $3.35 a barrel or 5.62% to settle at $56.26 a barrel during the previous trading session due to fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand.

India imports majority of its crude requirements and a decline in crude eases concerns on fiscal deficit, inflation and gives more room for the government to boost growth through spending on infrastructure.

On the macro front, on a review of the evolving liquidity conditions, RBI has decided to scale up the amounts to be purchased in the remaining two Open Market Operations (OMO) auctions scheduled in December 2018 to Rs 15000 crore each. Consequently, the total injection of durable liquidity for the month of December 2018 would amount to Rs 50000 crore.

Further, based on an assessment of the durable liquidity needs going forward, RBI has decided to conduct purchase of Government Securities under OMOs for an aggregate amount of Rs 50000 crore in the month of January 2019. The operations will be conducted through five auctions of Rs 10000 crore each.

The liquidity conditions will continue to be monitored and depending on the assessment, RBI will consider similar quantum of OMO purchases until end of March 2019. The exact calibration of the quantum of OMO would depend on sustained changes in the behaviour of currency in circulation, the magnitude of sterilisation operations for RBI's forex operations and other relevant factors.

Overseas, European stocks inched slightly higher while Asian stocks ended mixed Wednesday ahead of a highly anticipated Federal Reserve meeting that is expected to set the tone for interest rates next year.

On Wednesday, Japan reported that its trade balance in November was a deficit of 737.3 billion yen, from 450.1 billion yen in the previous month. This is its fourth deficit in last five months. The country's exports broadly slowed, partly due to weakening demand from China. Japanese exports rose 0.1% from a year earlier, as compared to October's 8.2% gain.

US stocks nudged higher on Tuesday in a volatile day as technology and consumer-focused companies climbed.

The Federal Reserve wraps up its final policy meeting of 2018 on Wednesday. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to raise its short-term interest rate by a modest quarter-point to a range of 2.25% to 2.5%. Investors are closely watching the Federal Reserve monetary policy guidance for 2019. The central bank forecasts three more rate hikes in 2019, but softer global growth could cause a shift in its hawkish stance. The Bank of Japan's monetary policy decision is due Thursday, followed by a briefing from Governor Haruhiko Kuroda. A Bank of England decision is also due on Thursday.

"327","1022070264","2018-12-19","https://kashmirobserver.net/2018/opinion/infamous-contractual-38802","Infamous Contractual !","Kashmir Observer",FALSE,"Due to the changing circumstances, organizations around the world are experiencing an increased level of economic strain and the academic organizations are no exception. These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output. One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as CONTRACTUAL. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department. This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors. Although these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, e.g., Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc. According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment. It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfillment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees. The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies. Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker;and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees.The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand. Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labeled theseemployees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfill the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labeled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment. Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors. But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees. Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, e.g., evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc. Being labeled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee. The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction. The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly beaurocratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately. The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach)of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees. Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorism was considered obsolete by 1930's and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfill their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world,we are not able to fulfill even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse. And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanentstaff members. These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labeled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public. When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions. Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrollments. These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind. The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees. The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers'account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paidneither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom andmany of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences. The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"". Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to themhas resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments. Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

""Manchester United is in my heart and it's brilliant to be coming back in this role,"" Solskjaer, who scored 126 goals in 366 appearances for United, said. ""I'm really looking forward to working with the very talented squad we have, the staff and everyone at the club.""

United confirmed the 45-year-old Norwegian's appointment until the end of the season in a statement which said he will be assisted by Mike Phelan as first-team coach, together with Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna.

Mourinho was dismissed on Tuesday after two-and-a-half years in charge and replaced by Solskjaer, who spent 11 years as a player at Old Trafford between 1996 and 2007 and scored the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final win over Bayern Munich.

Solskjaer, who has temporarily left his job in charge of Molde in his homeland, will take charge of his first game on Saturday at Cardiff, where he was sacked as manager in 2014. He had a spell as reserve-team manager at United between 2008 and 2011.

Molde have confirmed Solskjaer will return to the Norwegian side in the summer after recently signing a new contract that will keep him at the club until 2021.

""That Manchester United ask Molde FK to lend the manager is by itself an event and not least a statement of trust for both Ole Gunnar and Molde FK,"" Molde chief executive Oystein Neerland said in a club statement.

""We are happy to lend Ole Gunnar and we wish both him and the club a success. This is a big opportunity for Molde FK, we think it will help put Molde FK further on the football card.""

Solskjaer won just nine of his 30 games in charge of Cardiff after his appointment in January 2014. He oversaw their relegation from the Premier League and was dismissed in September 2014 after a disappointing start to their Championship campaign.

United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said he was confident Solskjaer's appointment would bring the squad and fans together.

""Ole is a club legend with huge experience, both on the pitch and in coaching roles,"" Woodward said.

""His history at Manchester United means he lives and breathes the culture here and everyone at the club is delighted to have him and Mike Phelan back. We are confident they will unite the players and the fans as we head into the second half of the season.""

Sources have told ESPN FC that Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is the preferred choice as the club's next permanent boss.

Mourinho was fired on Tuesday with United having made their worst start to a league campaign after 17 games since the 1990-91 season. United are sixth in the Premier League, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 behind fourth-placed Chelsea.

United have two home fixtures over the Christmas period, hosting Huddersfield Town on Dec. 26 before Bournemouth visit Old Trafford four days later."

He had just about recovered from an Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) injury and his shaky feet raised self-doubts on his ability to make the cut. However, coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in him. Poojary slowly regained his confidence and played a crucial role in the team's run-up to the final.

It's been the case with Poojary since he first took to the beautiful game. Each time he decided to walk away from football, the universe conspired in a way to ensure that he was drawn right back to it. It's what has made him believe in something that he calls magic today, besides, of course, his own abilities.

For, without that little bit of enchantment, the dream of playing professional football would have remained just that, let alone turning out for the senior national side in the Indian blues.

A stroke of luck

Football entered Poojary's world quite by chance. At St. Augustines High School in Nerul in Navi Mumbai, he had readied himself to go for cricket selections but erroneously landed up at the football trials instead. One look at his ability to run with the ball at his feet earned him plaudits at that early stage.

""We had a good system in place with experienced coaches to guide us. The likes of Rahul Bheke, who went on to play professional football, were from my school. Once I got started, I never really stopped playing,"" Poojary says.

When it came to school football, competition was scarce in Navi Mumbai -- a far cry from the hundreds of teams that turn out in the league conducted by the Mumbai School Sports Association. So while his school were champions for a good eight years that he was there, the real challenge lay in locating a club to further his prospects. That opportunity came in the form of a team comprising boys from the Ryan International Group of schools, where Poojary was part of the squad the earned promotion to the first division of the Mumbai District Football Association league.

Education first

Back home, the conditions on him playing football were set even before he was out of school. Three years before Poojary was born, his father, Chandrashekhar, had moved to Mumbai from Mangalore in search of work and was employed as a waiter at a hotel in Chembur. Excelling at education was key to bettering his prospects in the future and in turn, easing the financial burden on the family.

""I come from a middle class household, so money matters for us. Aur life main security tab milegi, jab padhai karega. Mereko doctor, engineer banana that, lekin main to flop ho gaya (And you'll earn security in life if you studied. They wanted to make me an engineer or a doctor, but I simply flopped),"" Poojary says, smiling.

After performing reasonably well in his 10th grade, Poojary took to the science stream. Around the same time, someone told him about trials at Mumbai FC for their under-15 side. He made the cut and proved his worth at the Manchester United Premier Cup in 2011 that featured most junior I-League teams.

By the end of the tournament, Poojary had captained the side to the final where they lost to Salgaocar, though his performance still earned him the best player award. Coach Naushad Moosa was left impressed with the promise he had shown, and the following year, promoted him to the Mumbai FC under-19 side and asked him to train with the big boys.

Despite struggling with injuries and low on confidence, Poojary received the backing of India coach Stephen Constantine. Image courtesy: Nikhil Poojary

For three years, Poojary was part of a daily grind that started at 4.30 am, involved changing three trains and spending around 2 and a half hours travelling in each direction, to get to the training ground in Borivali from his home in Nerul.

""And this was if I managed to get onto the train, which used to be really crowded at times,"" he recalls.

The taxing routine, however, left little time for studies, and in turn, Poojary flunked his 12th-grade examination. His father made a quick call to coach Moosa and told him that his son would play no further part at Mumbai FC. It was to be a premature end to his football career, yet life handed him a lifeline when he least expected it.

A team called Mumbai Tigers FC, which was formed around the same time in Vashi -- a short distance from his home -- reached out to him with an offer of Rs 10,000. It was unheard of for an under-19 player at the time.

""It was a relief for me and motivation for my parents to allow me to continue playing. At a time when I was about to quit, a new club came my way. You can call it God's gift,"" Poojary says.

Under the watchful eye of coach Bimal Ghosh, who is known to have groomed a number of young players, Poojary was once again, handed the opportunity to train with the big boys -- the likes of Steven Dias, NP Pradeep, Surkumar Singh and Paresh Shivalkar, who had already made a mark at the national stage. Having lost a year at college, there was enough time now to train and Poojary slowly found his feet among the seniors. But even as he settled into the new set up, the club suddenly shut shop, leaving him with question marks on his decision to continue playing all over again.

The hunt begins

From Mumbai Tigers, Poojary moved to Air India, who had pulled out of the I-League but actively played other tournaments. The money was also good and his parents finally relented on their insistence that he chase an education. When the time to renew his contract came a year later, Poojary decided to hold his horses on the advice of an agent, who told him that he would soon sign for a bigger, better club. That offer never arrived and after Mumbai FC too declined to sign him, Poojary found himself relatively stranded midway through 2015, with no income at his disposal for over six months.

""That was a time that I thought I would give up on a career in professional football, join a call centre and see where my life would take me,"" Poojary says.

Even as he was finalising his decision to quit playing, an offer to try out at Mohammedan Sporting came his way in November 2015. There was no question of asking his parents on their opinion, for he knew their decision, so with a one-way ticket, he decided to take on a 36-hour, unreserved train ride to Kolkata and try his luck.

""It was around Durga Puja and I didn't get a seat, so I slept next to the toilet at the start of the journey. I soon met some East Bengal supporters on the train, and when I told them I was Bheke's friend (who was at East Bengal at that time) and was going for trials, they gave me some place to sit,"" he says.

With the finances hard to manage at home, Poojary arrived in Kolkata relatively penniless and walked to Mohammedan's training facility. He was soon directed to the dressing room, which was to be his home for the next week. Before leaving, he was handed a can of mosquito repellent by the club officials and shown a sofa that was to be his bed.

""And I did need it at night amid all the muck,"" Poojary quips.

In the week that followed, Poojary was at the trials and during his time off the field, he would go watch the first team play in the Calcutta Football League alongside the supporters.

""An entire truckload of fans -- I had never seen anything like it before, because who asks a footballer anything in Mumbai? I would join them to the ground and back, eat biryani with them and get to see what Kolkata football was all about. It was nothing like I had experienced before and when I spoke to my mother, I remember telling her that I wasn't going to find a team better than this one,"" he says.

Further dejection

But by the end of it, further rejection followed as he was denied a contract and he called his agent to give him an earful, distraught at his prospects after all the struggle. He then pleaded his father to book him a ticket, unable to hold back his tears, simply wanting to return home and hang up his boots.

""That evening, my agent called me again and said that East Bengal was offering me trials. I laughed at the prospect of such a big club calling upon me, when I had been rejected by Mohammedan. But he insisted so I went,"" he says.

Before Poojary was handed the opportunity to step on the ground, former player and now a part of the East Bengal management, Alvito D'Cunha, did a background check on him by calling his coaches. What followed were three of the most horrible days at trials, after which, he was duly informed that a practice game against Army XI would be his last stint before he was being sent back home. That in turn, switched the balance in Poojary's favour for the first time in his senior career.

Striking gold

In the Calcutta Football League that year, Army XI had handed East Bengal a shock defeat. As a result, the scheduled fixture was expected to draw a lot of eyeballs and was even broadcasted on local television. East Bengal had their revenge with a 2-0 win, but more importunately, the fans had a new hero in their midst in Poojary, who had scored both goals.

""You know how it is to score a goal in India -- it then doesn't matter whether you had a decent game or not. That evening, I was handed a three-year contract. And I didn't bother looking at the amount because playing for East Bengal was massive,"" Poojary says.

What Poojary didn't know then was that scouts from the national team had also made their way there and in a few days, he received his first call-up for the India under-23 side. However, a hamstring injury ruled him out for the rest of the year.

By the time the next season arrived, Poojary was a wreck. The pressure of playing for East Bengal had told time and again, and at the back of his head, self-doubts had crept in on whether he would be able to handle another intense season in Kolkata.

""The fans would watch every single game and would critically analyse your performance, whether in person or on social media. I thought of terminating my contract and staying back in Mumbai. But I had always looked up to Rahul Bheke, who was at East Bengal at the time, and when he called and insisted that I come, I decided to go,"" he says.

India debut beckons

That stint is what Poojary calls his breakthrough season. Under coach Trevor Morgan, he made rapid progress and after 14 appearances in the I-League, he received another call-up for the India under-23 side. And this time, he didn't disappoint.

After putting on a good show in practice games in Singapore and Qatar, Poojary found himself in the India squad for the Tri-Nations Cup in Mumbai in August 2017. It was his first senior call-up and one of the few occasions when his parents could come to watch him play, making his debut even more special.

""There couldn't have been anything bigger for me than my folks making it there. Though I came on as a substitute in the first game, I started the second. There were tears streaming down my face when the national anthem played. Even today, I find all this very hard to believe,"" he says.

Injury issues

After the tournament, Poojary received a call from FC Pune City who asked him if he was interested in signing for them. He decided to go back to Kolkata to talk to East Bengal about his future. But during the first few training sessions, he hit rock bottom after all the highs, picking up an ACL injury that ruled him out through all of last year.

""After my surgery, I went to multiple doctors but my rehab had some major ups and downs. One day I felt fit and then the next, I would have my confidence knocked out at training. I wasn't sure if I would play at a good level again,"" he recalls.

Though injured, Pune City stood by their man and signed him, taking over his recovery process. When it came to the national team, Poojary had been sounded out before his operation that he would be considered for the SAFF Championship in Bangladesh and his rehabilitation had been planned in a way, that he would be ready in time for the tournament in September this year.

Fighting back

During the first day at camp, he had the lowest score on the fitness test. The niggling pain was a constant source of torment and Poojary had serious doubts on playing.

""They pushed me so hard that I thought it would aggravate my injury. When I look back now, clearly I had no idea that they had a plan,"" he says.

""Coach Stephen Constantine showed tremendous faith in me. The rest of the support staff would conduct endless sessions, specifically for me, and I remember that the massage therapy would go on until midnight. It's their hard work and their confidence in me that gave me that little bit of belief in my own abilities,"" he adds.

After the 45-day camp which also featured games in Australia, Poojary made the cut to the squad for the SAFF Championship. The time on field had gradually helped him gain back his confidence and Constantine handed him his first chance as a second-half substitute against Sri Lanka. In the next tie against the Maldives, Poojary started the game and notched up his first international goal.

""That goal was a massive boost for me; more so, because I realised I had recovered, both physically and mentally. The goal was for the coaching staff who had worked so hard on me,"" he says.

Poojary considers himself to be a very different person after undergoing all that he had during the injury. He's back at his best now, with seven appearances for Pune City, as well as game time during the national side's friendly against China.

Having made the cut for the 34-member, preliminary squad for the AFC Asian Cup, he will be looking to prove his worth at the Indian camp. And though Pune City have had a turbulent season thus far, he certainly believes in a little bit of magic these days.

The fall in Chinese shares was also driven by weakness across Asian markets, which brewed on the back of growth worries. Among SSE sectors, gains in real estate and utilities shares were offset by losses in healthcare and energy companies. In late afternoon trade, the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.7%, or 18.12 points, to 2,558.52, meanwhile the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China's second exchange, shed 1.04%, or 13.71 points, to 1,298.84. The blue-chip CSI300 index was down 0.91%, or 28.43 points, to 3,100.

Mr Xi called on Tuesday for the unswerving implementation of reforms on Beijing's terms but offered no new specific measures. Some in the market were expecting a big announcement on fiscal policy loosening and a tax cut of as much as 5 trillion yuan in the next five years. Several investors turned their focus on China's central economic work conference this week, where 2019 growth targets and policy goals will be discussed.

With a key speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping offering no new specific measures for the implementation of reforms, investors now await the Federal Reserve's monetary policy guidance for clues about future rate hikes.

Investors were also cautious ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision Thursday morning. The rate decision will be followed by a press conference with chairman Jerome Powell. The market is pricing in a 70% chance of a US rate hike however economists will pay most attention to the tone of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's statement.

Many investors now expect signs of economic turbulence would prompt the Fed to signal a slowdown in the pace of tightening next year.

Shares of healthcare firms declined, as investors reacted to policy headwinds including a pilot volume-based procurement policy.

Energy firms retreated, tracking weakness in oil prices on economic slowdown fears and a supply glut. Crude oil prices bounced back slightly in Asian trade on Wednesday after plunging on worries about rising supplies and weakening global growth, which could weigh on demand. Benchmark U. S. crude gained 12 cents to $46.72 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract gave up $3.60 to $46.60 on Tuesday. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 34 cents to $56.60 a barrel. It lost $3.35 to $56.26 a barrel in London.

Property shares climbed, after a Chinese city removed curbs on property sales, raising speculation of policy loosening in the tightly-regulated sector amid an economic slowdown.

CURRENCY NEWS: China yuan was tad stronger against greenback on Wednesday, despite central bank softer mid-point rate, as investors anxiously waited for the outcome of this year's last Federal Reserve policy meeting. Prior to market opening on Wednesday, the People's Bank of China set the midpoint rate at 6.8869 per dollar, 15 pips weaker than the previous fix of 6.8854. In the spot market, the onshore yuan opened at 6.8890 per dollar and was changing hands at 6.8893 at midday, 66 pips firmer than the previous late session close.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nasdaq Composite managed to squeeze out some modest gains, yet they also finished well off their best levels of the day.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 83 points, or 0.4%, to 23,678. The Nasdaq Composite finished higher by 0.4% to 6,784. The S&P 500 was mostly unchanged at 2,546.

The S&P 500 sectors were mixed with consumer discretionary and real estate on the winning end, and energy and consumer staples on the losing end.

Reviewing Tuesday's economic data, which included Housing Starts and Building Permits for November, the Housing Starts and Building Permits Report for November wasn't as strong as the headline figures suggested, as it featured little to no growth in both permits and starts for single-family units. Total starts increased 3.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.256 million units (consensus 1.230 million), yet starts for single-family units declined 4.6% to 824,000, which is the lowest since May 2017. Total permits increased 5.0% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.328 million ( consensus 1.270 million), yet permits for single-family units were up just 0.1% to 848,000. The key takeaway from the report is that it substantiates the weakening levels of homebuilder confidence and is a reflection of the impact rising interest rates are having on single-family construction activity.

The Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates for the fourth time this year at its two-day policy meeting ending on Wednesday, a factor generally favorable for the dollar and negative for gold, but such a move has long been expected in financial markets. Market expectations for 2019, once put at three to four more increases, have also begun to lessen on the back of dovish comments from Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed will be joined by the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England in offering policy updates this week.

In company news, shares of Boeing are up 4% after the airplane manufacturer late-Monday announced a dividend increase and a share-buyback program.

Market participants are largely expecting the FOMC to raise the target range by 25 basis points to 2.25% to 2.50%. What remains a pertinent source of uncertainty is what the Federal Reserve will do with its interest rate projections and possibly its balance sheet normalization effort.

Bullion prices ended on a mixed note on Tuesday, 18 Dec 2018 at Comex. Gold prices on Tuesday marked a modest gain, enough to notch their highest finish in five months, finding some support on a weaker dollar ahead of a monetary policy update this week from the Federal Reserve.vTraders eagerly awaited the central bank's decision on interest rates, as well as hints on the Fed's pace for next year's expected rate increases, when it issues its latest outlook for monetary policy on Wednesday.

Gold for February delivery on Comex edged up by $1.80, or 0.1%, to settle at $1,253.60 an ounce. The contract has gained about 2.2% month to date. March silver fell 5.8 cents, or 0.4%, to $14.701 an ounce.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index was down slightly Tuesday as gold futures settled, with a week-to-date decline of 0.4%. A weaker U.S. unit typically boosts demand for commodities priced in dollars as it makes them less expensive to users of other currencies.

Crude oil futures tumbled on Tuesday, 18 December 2018 with a more than 7% loss sending benchmark U.S. crude prices to their lowest finish in nearly 16 months, as concerns over a potential global supply glut rattled the market. Losses for oil intensified in late-morning dealings after it was reported that Russia was increasing its output to 11.42 million barrels a day this month.

January West Texas Intermediate crude dropped $3.64, or 7.3%, to settle at $46.24 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Bearish momentum has been consuming investors for weeks and much may be riding on a two-day Federal Open Market Committee meeting that began Tuesday.

Key weekly data on U.S. petroleum supplies will be released on Wednesday by the EIA. Market expect the government agency to report a decline of 3 million barrels in crude supplies. The survey also forecast a supply rise of 2.6 barrels for gasoline and a decline of 900,000 barrels for distillates.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the FOMC Rate Decision for December, Existing Home Sales for November, the weekly MBA Mortgage Applications Index, and the Current Account Balance for Q3 on Wednesday.

Anxiety - waiting for their name to be called up, Thrill - watching the franchises fighting to lift the paddles to secure their services for the season, Joy - when the auctioneer put the hammer down confirming the player being signed up by a certain franchise, or Disappointment - when players did not find a team who wanted their services, or when they did not get signed up for a fee they were expecting.

Yes, that's just what players go through when the IPL Player Auction takes place. Players give it their best on the field all the time, throw in their names in the IPL Auction register, and wait - while the franchise owners, the team coaches and support staff strategise, figure out their needs and then decide which player to chase at the Auction.

As has happened every year, several players - unknown hitherto - became household names overnight and found their names alongside 'Breaking News' on the television screens.

Along the same lines, a few players - who were expected to miss the bus - found takers, despite them not doing anything significant to merit a paddle-raise. Here's looking at a few such players, who can be termed 'surprise signings'.

Mohit Sharma

The Chennai Super Kings forked out INR 5 Crores for the 30-year old pacer Mohit Sharma, who was the team's highest wicket-takers in IPL 2014. Last season, Mohit turned up for Kings XI Punjab; after acceptable returns in his first outing of the season, his returns in the remainder of the season read: 8 matches, 5 wickets, 57.80 average, 11.25 economy rate.

Now, Mohit has the reputation of being an extremely hard-working bowler and can do plenty of damage with the ball when he finds his rhythm. But has he done anything since the last IPL to indicate he is in any kind of rhythm to merit such a huge price at the auction?

Ishant Sharma

There is no denying that Ishant Sharma is bowling the best he ever has. But that form has only been seen in the longer formats - Test cricket, Ranji Trophy, etc. The Delhi Capitals franchise dished out INR 1.1 Crore to sign up the lanky pacer. Ricky Ponting, the Delhi Capitals coach - who was on commentary duties for the first two Test matches in Australia - has first-hand witnessed how good Ishant has been with the red ball.

Ishant perhaps found that rhythm that has led to him becoming India's pace spearhead in Test matches on the tour of Sri Lanka in 2015. While his red ball numbers are outstanding, his white ball numbers - particularly in the shortest format - aren't great.

Barinder Sran

The Mumbai Indians doled out INR 3.4 Crore to secure the services of the Punjab medium pacer Barinder Sran, who has so far played 6 ODIs & 2 T20Is for India. Given the build of the MI squad, they desperately needed to bolster their Indian fast bowling attack. However, does that explain them going after the 26-year old Sran, who was released by Kings XI Punjab, and has done very little of note in the last few months?

Yuvraj Singh

A player who made stellar contributions to India's wins in the World T20 2007 and World Cup 2011, Yuvraj Singh was signed up by the Mumbai Indians for INR 1.0 Crore. If one were to go by form as the only factor, Yuvraj Singh shouldn't have landed a contract at Tuesday's auction. Here's why:

Was MI's decision to sign up Yuvraj Singh based on cricketing logic alone, or were there other factors at work?

Sarafaraz Khan

Kings XI Punjab signed up Sarfaraz Khan for INR 25 Lacs. The 21-year old's selection is really puzzling:

he was listed in the all-rounder's category, when he has bowled only 18 deliveries in 78 matches at the senior level and is yet to pick up a wicket,he has not played ONE senior level competitive cricket match since the completion of last IPL; his last senior-level competitive match was against Rajasthan Royals on 19 May 2018,he was released by Royal Challengers Bangalore, who had retained him prior to last season.

The fate of 70 mentally challenged students studying at the centre, some of whom are also physically disabled, hinges on how the Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society is able to make ends meet.

These students, aged between four and 18 years, belong to economically disadvantaged families whose meagre incomes come from pulling rickshaws, selling vegetables and fruits or working as domestic help.

The Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society has been managing its Child Guidance Centre (CGC) with the help of financial grants it receives under the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rehabilitation Scheme. The crisis for the specialised school began when the ministry issued guidelines that from April 1, 2018, the salaries of the staff were to be increased two and a half times or more. This resulted in the annual expenditure on salaries going up from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 14 lakh.

""The yearly government funding on which CGC runs is retrospective, that is, the society has to meet all the expenses, including staff salaries, before it actually receives the grant from the social justice ministry,"" explained Baran Farooqi, general secretary of the society. ""This meant that when the ministry hiked the salaries of teachers employed on contract for the project, the society was forced to arrange almost double the amount it used to till 2017-18 in order to meet the incremental expenses.""

Perhaps even the additional finances could have been somehow managed. But discouragingly, the ministry has affected the working of the school by being erratic in the disbursal of grants. In fact CGC is still awaiting the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

What also irks Farooqi is the whimsical manner in which the grants are disbursed. ""Reimbursements are either denied to us on arbitrary grounds or only a fraction of the stipulated amount is released,"" he pointed out. As an example, Farooqi reiterated the failure of the ministry to release the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

The families of the students studying in CGC do not have the means to send them to any other school. Besides, here they can also get the specialised training required by their mentally challenged ward, such as IQ assessment, counselling, psychological assessment, physiotherapy and reading, writing and speech therapies. These and other measures could mean a world of difference in the way the children receive their education.

The society is more than 40 years old and runs several social service programmes other than this school. Jamia does assist it with space and other necessary infrastructural necessities, but CGC has to manage funds on its own."

However, far from being the model hospital, it was in a decrepit state from inside with urgent need of maintenance behind its a glass facade. This was in addition to flouting of several fire norms.

In April 2008, the Employees' State Insurance (ESI) Corporation chose to turn it into a model hospital. For the same, it had granted a contract to National Building Construction Corporation (India) Ltd on 13 March 2009, funding Rs 152.35 crore for the project. It had subsequently granted NBCC another Rs 108.49 crore to construct PG hostel, staff housing among other things.

Renovation of the building commenced in March 2009 and was expected to complete by August 2013. Nine years hence, the reconstruction work is yet to meet its deadline.

The hospital was also earmarked to be developed as an Occupational Disease Centre for Western Region.

Constructed in 1977, the 600-bed hospital was in a sorry state like any other ESIC hospitals. With the condition getting worse over the years, the state government reduced its capacity to 300 beds in 2007. ""In 2009, ESI Corporation decided to take over one hospital from each state and run it as a model hospital after upgrading it. ESIC Kamgar hospital was chosen from Maharashtra,"" said an officer from the hospital. As per the decision of Corporation, a model hospital should have all the general facilities and some super specialities services, so that it becomes a benchmark for other hospitals.

""After almost 10 years the hospital is still in a Harappa-Mohenjodaro state despite its glass facade and colourful walls. Only half of its flooring is complete. The ground floor of the building has turned into a storehouse of construction material. During monsoons, patients have to be shifted because of leakages and water logging in wards. We wrote many letters to the authorities, but to no avail. The work is going on at a snail's pace,"" said Vijayrao Tate, vice chairman of All India ESIC Employee's Union.

""We have asked ESC Corporation to shift the hospital to a nearby staff building while rennovation is going on. But our requests fell on deaf ears. Now ESC have taken over Aurangabad and Pune hospitals for renovation. God knows what will happen to them,"" said another member from Union."

The Indian Super League club parted ways with the English coach after he was under intense scrutiny for the poor performances of the club this season.

Although this wasn't a surprise, it is interesting to note that prior to this season, James was handed a three-year contract by the club stating that they had a vision for the club.

They had put a lot of faith in James who had guided the club to the final of the first ISL edition before leaving.

The Englishman returned to Blasters last season as an interim manager after Rene Meulensteen was sacked.

However, in his first full season as the coach, the team has struggled. Blasters are going through their worst run in ISL history with six draws and five defeats and are eighth in the league on nine points. They have only one win from twelve matches.

The lowest point of the season for the Blasters was their latest 6-1 thrashing at the hands of Mumbai City FC.

""Kerala Blasters and David James have decided to end their association on a mutual consent. The club would like to thank David for his efforts towards the team and wishes him all the very best in his career,"" said Kerala Blasters CEO Varun Tripuraneni in a statement released by the club on Tuesday.

What really worked against James was losing the support of the Kerala Blasters fans. Fans started boycotting home matches and took to social media to express their displeasure. The results weren't coming, his tactics were questioned and everything he did was up for debate and discussion.

A section of fans had called him clueless and cricticised the way he set his team up. Attendance fell into the eight thousand bracket for the last two home games which was a substantial drop.

Before the Mumbai loss, they had lost 1-0 to struggling Pune City as well. They were expected to beat a team who were struggling with injuries and suspensions. However, Kerala struggled to create chances and looked like a disjointed lot.

James has been put out of his misery now.

""I would like to thank the management, players and all the staff at Blasters for their support and friendship. I wish them all the best for the future. I am grateful to the supporters who stood by me. Thank you too, for making it a memorable experience,"" James was quoted in the club statement.

The club hasn't announced a new appointment and assistant coach Thangboi Singto is expected to take charge as interim coach."

ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX halted Tuesday's launch of a long-delayed navigation satellite for the U.S. military, postponing for at least a day the space transportation company's first designated national security mission for the United States.

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, carrying a roughly $500 million global positioning system (GPS) satellite built by Lockheed Martin Corp, was due to take off from Florida's Cape Canaveral shortly after 9:30 a.m. local time (1730 GMT), but was stopped minutes before takeoff.

""This abort was triggered by the onboard Falcon 9 flight computer,"" a SpaceX official narrating the launch sequence said, adding that SpaceX would attempt the launch on Wednesday morning.

SpaceX later tweeted that the Falcon 9 and payload remain healthy and cited an ""out of family"" reading on the rocket's first stage sensors for the delay.

U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who traveled to Florida to watch the launch, announced afterward that President Donald Trump would direct the Pentagon to establish a Combatant Command to oversee America's activities in space.

The Space Command, the 11th such Combatant Command in the U.S. military, comes as the United States seeks to grow its military footprint in space.

A successful launch would be a significant victory for Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur who spent years trying to break into the market for lucrative military space launches, long dominated by Lockheed and Boeing Co.

SpaceX sued the U.S. Air Force in 2014 in protest over the military's award of a multibillion-dollar, non-compete contract for 36 rocket launches to United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed.

SpaceX dropped the lawsuit in 2015 after the Air Force agreed to open up competition, according to SpaceX's website.

The next year, SpaceX won an $83 million Air Force contract to launch the GPS III satellite, which will have a lifespan of 15 years, Air Force spokesman William Russell said by phone.

Tuesday's launch was to be the first of 32 satellites in production by Lockheed under contracts worth a combined $12.6 billion for the Air Force's GPS III program, Lockheed spokesman Chip Eschenfelder said.

""Once fully operational, this latest generation of GPS satellites will bring new capabilities to users, including three times greater accuracy and up to eight times the anti-jamming capabilities,"" said Russell.

The GPS satellite launch was originally scheduled for 2014 but has been hobbled by production delays, the Air Force said.

The next GPS III satellite will launch in mid-2019, Eschenfelder said, while subsequent satellites undergo testing in the company's Colorado processing facility.

The launch marks SpaceX's first so-called National Security Space mission as defined by the U.S. military, SpaceX said.

In 2017, the Hawthorne, California-based company launched payloads for the Department of Defense that were not designated as a National Security Space missions.

The fire at ESIC Hospital in Andheri on Monday was a disaster in waiting. This was the sentiment echoed by staffers, union leaders and doctors, who protested demanding safe working conditions on Tuesday.

Shipra Vishwakarma, an assistant orderly at the hospital for the past seven years, said, ""When we heard of the fire, we were on first floor. We rushed to the paediatric ward on the third floor and carried or led the children out. The building is connected to the adjacent building but that exit was shut with metal sheets. We broke them open and went there, came down through the staircase. Who is responsible for the people who have died?""

Amruta Shelar, a nurse at the hospital, said, ""We have been seeing this construction work for almost 10 years now. The debris is lying here and there. Why did the NBCC take so long? Their workers had placed material in the room that caught fire. Did they take permission? They had shut one exit too.""

According to the staff union, mishaps are not new in the hospital. In March, there was a fire in the hospital's kitchen and four days before the incident, a Cobra emerged out of the scrap lying on the premises. A union member said, ""After the snake emerged, we wrote to the hospital management to clear the scrap. The management then wrote to the NBCC contractor, but nothing happened. Small fires are a routine occurrence. But eight people have lost their lives.""

Union member Swarnav Banerjee said, ""Why did the hospital not have CCTV cameras, a disaster management protocol? The condition of the staff quarters has been pathetic for years now. Why didn't the administration penalise the contractor for the repeated delays?""

The hospital building, constructed in the 1970s, neither has a fire brigade NOC nor an occupation certificate from the MIDC, which was designated as special planning authority of the area decades later. Since the building is not covered under the Fire Act, 2005, the MIDC fire brigade cannot prosecute it. ""The old building does not fall under the purview of the Fire Act and therefore ours. ""As per Section 3 of the Act, the owners and occupiers are responsible for their fire safety,"" said M.V. Ogale, deputy chief fire officer, MIDC Fire Brigade.

Hospital medical superintendent B.B. Gupta admitted it did not have fire-fighting equipment except fire extinguishers. ""We were in the process of installing them. These things are looked into by the ESIC head office.""

The old building's revised plans to put a glass façade had received a provisional commencement certificate of the MIDC. As for the new building, the hospital had planned new wards, operation theatres, blood bank, and staff quarters. The contractors had applied to the MIDC fire brigade for a NOC around 15 days ago but the brigade instead pointed out several errors to them.

""They were in process of rectifying those. The fire occurred in the old building,"" Mr. Ogale said. The MIDC fire brigade has only one fire station in SEEPZ for the entire industrial area. When asked about challenges during Monday's firefighting, he said the biggest challenge was that of bedridden patients. ""We brought down most of the patients on our shoulders. Both fire brigades worked in tandem.""

The staffers now face uncertainty as the hospital might not start functioning any time soon. Meenal Kasare, a radiology technician, said, ""The hospital management has not replaced the staffers who retired after 2012, and instead hired contractual ones. Most nursing orderlies and sweepers are on contract. Only a month ago, there had been a fire and our union members had warned them.""

The staffers now want to be accommodated in a ESIC hospital, but the other ESIC hospitals in the city are State-run and the one in Marol was run by the Central government. The staff do not want to move out of Mumbai.

Union Minister of State for Labour and Employment Santosh Kumar Gangwar, who visited the ESIC Hospital on Tuesday, said that the State government would conduct an inquiry and submit a report to the Central government.

ESIC additional commissioner S.K. Sinha said, ""The NBCC was looking after the construction. It's status and deficiencies need to be checked with them."" Dr. Gupta said they have accommodated all patients in other hospitals and ESIC doctors are there for assistance. When asked whether the contractor had taken his permission to store material on the ground floor, he answered in the negative. He said it was not a functional room but a vacant one where material was stored.

NBCC could not be reached for comment. Mr. Gangwar said, ""This is a very unfortunate incident. It is true that NBCC had been working here for some time now. The secretary had reviewed the situation here around 10 days ago. But these past incidents of fire were never reported to us."""

U.S. crude oil fell $2.22, or 4.4 percent to trade at $47.64 a barrel by 10:57 a.m. EST (1553 GMT), its weakest since September 2017.

Global benchmark Brent lost $1.93, or 3 percent to trade at $57.68 a barrel after earlier dropping to $57.20, a 14-month low.

World stock markets inched higher on Tuesday as investors looked ahead to whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be able to raise interest rates much further. Equity markets have had steep declines over the last two months.

Investor confidence is deteriorating, with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch's December investor survey showed.

""There was a flood of supply slide news yesterday which, in combination with the demand destruction that the stock market slide implied, got us below $50 (a barrel for U.S. crude), and that gave us a strong sell signal,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures with Mizuho in New York.

Britain's largest oilfield restarted, increasing supply, the U.S. government said output from shale would top 8 million barrels per day this year, and data suggested U.S. crude inventories would rise this week.

Both oil benchmarks have shed more than 30 percent since early October due to swelling global inventories. Volumes were low on Tuesday heading into the holiday season, and ahead of expiry for the front-month U.S. crude futures contract.

Japan's Nikkei lost 1.8 percent after U.S. stocks dropped to their lowest in more than a year.

""A large part of the move is due to a broader market sell-off, with both U.S. and Asian equity markets coming under pressure,"" said commodities strategist Warren Patterson at Dutch bank ING in Amsterdam.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices.

But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia.

Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for the oil futures contract, rose more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.

Britain's largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipework, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 barrels per day and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline which brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields.

Talking to reporters here, BJP national vice president and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe alleged that the Rahul Gandhi-led party was making a mountain out of a molehill.

""It is very unfortunate that (the act of) spreading this kind of information... Indulging in this kind of irresponsible allegation-mongering, is unfortunately impacting our defence establishments as well,"" he said.

Referring to Manohar Parrikar, who was a defence minister in the Modi government till last year before he returned to Goa as the chief minister, Sahasrabuddhe said defence establishments were being led by ""unimpeachable"" leaders like Parrikar.

""Unfortunately, the Congress party is very very irresponsibly indulging in this allegation-mongering... We find that the party is trying to build up some kind of courage out of confusion and concoction, which is reprehensible.

""We all condemn these attempts because they are ultimately impacting the credibility of the defence establishments as well,"" he said.

On Congress president Gandhi's attack on the Centre on the issue, Sahasrabuddhe said every act of commission and omission has its own impact on the national life, national discourse and national narrative.

""The impact of these irresponsible allegations which had no basis at all... and it has now been established by the Supreme Court itself through its verdict. So naturally, it amounts to some kind of irresponsibility and any irresponsible act impacts the interest of the nation,"" the BJP leader said.

To a question whether the Rafale deal could become an issue for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, he said, ""If Congress continues with its campaign through all kind of irresponsibility, then God only should save their attempts of creating a negative narrative.""

Sahasrabuddhe said the Congress was not ready to accept the Supreme Court's verdict. ""The court has unambiguously given its verdict. They have said they found nothing illegal, nothing suspicious about decision in purchase of fighter plane Rafale...also there is nothing commercial about the selection of partners,"" he said.

The apex court Friday dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets saying there was no occasion to really doubt the decision making process warranting setting aside of the contract.

""The Congress is indulging in making a mountain out of a molehill. It has been trying to spread misinformation and misguide the people of the country,"" Sahasrabuddhe said.

According to the BJP leader, the demand for high-powered fighter planes existed in the Air Force for the last two decades.

""Our neighbouring countries, including Pakistan and China, are well-equipped with fighter planes. Therefore, the (Indian) Air Force has been asking for high capacity fighter planes since the last 20 years,"" he said.

""From 2008, the active process started in this regard initiated by the erstwhile government. But unfortunately, even five years later it did not attain finalisation,"" the BJP leader said.

""As far as negotiations are concerned, there were 74 meetings between both the governments (the Narendra Modi-led dispensation and France). The negotiations during the UPA were not at the government-to-government level, unlike that under the Modi-led government,"" Sahasrabuddhe said.

Fresh from their Europa League triumph, the players and coach were quick to lay down a marker. In Mourinhospeak, that means potshots.

File image of Ed Woodward and Jose Mourinho. Reuters

Even in a happy moment, the manager predictably denounced those who had failed to land silverware. The United head coach won two trophies that season while his prime challengers -- namely Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and, to an extent, Mauricio Pochettino -- were left empty-handed. Mourinho was quick to remind the world, ""there are lots of poets in football, the poets don't win many titles, we knew where they were better than us, and us better than them.""

Of course, managers say many things and it would be tiresome if we were to pick apart every word that comes out from their gob. But the above utterance by Mourinho was a matter of conviction. The now ex-United manager has built a career on reneging the vows he took as a coach at Barcelona in the 1990s. A proactive style is his favoured enemy, and his considerable success is supposed to be an argument against that kind of football.

It is ironic too that Mourinho now finds himself without a job that he once coveted much, after a match in which his tactics found slight vindication. United's equaliser against Liverpool was provoked by an error on the goalkeeper's part - a crude example of that famous maxim by Mourinho, 'Whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake.' But as the match went on to prove, and indeed this season has shown in starker terms than before, it is the football of Klopp, Guardiola, Pochettino, and Sarri that is a more persuasive force for victory.

The problem for Mourinho is not that he failed, rather that he increasingly seems to be a yesterday's man. His pragmatism has locked him up. Mourinho today is a coach who offers rehearsed answers to questions that are new. It is not that his ideas are obsolete; the history of tactics is cyclical, and not linear. But Mourinho's crisis is that his ability to do the things he always did well are on the wane.

The Portuguese coach's successful clubs were known to build from an unforgiving defence that had players assimilating his ideas and putting them into practice as if they were their own. When he first arrived in England, Mourinho's Chelsea side was made up of defenders who went on to become pillars of the squad. He liked working with relatively smaller squads and rotating only when necessary. As Mourinho made 53 changes in 17 league games this season, that much-prized stability was difficult to find anywhere on the pitch.

Perhaps, it could have turned out differently if the manager had been given the defenders of his choice in the summer. United extended Mourinho's contract to 2020 this January but only six months later, the club had lost confidence in him. Chief Executive Ed Woodward preferred to sign younger defenders with high resale value, not proven players who could offer only two-three seasons at most. That would have been a reasonable move if the club was looking to build a team for the long-term with the manager in place; not when the head coach Mourinho, who has a history of temporary success, was asked to produce immediate rewards.

As it so often happens with him, the bus crashed in the manager's third season at the club. He could no longer park it and the defence leaked goals without any solution in sight. United could have allowed Mourinho to have his way in the January transfer window but the tension at the club became too much to bear. So five months before David Moyes' initial contract at United was supposed to end, a stiff severance package for Mourinho was deemed necessary.

Importantly, the manager becomes another expensive casualty in a long line of damaging moves for United. Since 2005, when the Glazer family took ownership of the club, heavy debts have lined the finances. The success in Alex Ferguson's later years kept the difficult questions at bay but his departure broke the bulwark. Poor administrative practices finally had their say. There can be questions over the work of David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, and even Mourinho, but nobody should blame them severely for the ruinous position that United finds itself in.

It's clear now that Ed Woodward is a byword for inept leadership. After ensuring that the club was poorer by a billion pounds as part of the takeover by Glazers, Woodward has gone on to show why bankers today are considered to be of dubious standing. His lack of depth is stunning, revealed by the absence of direction in his transfer dealings and recruitment of the coaching staff. Moyes, van Gaal, and Mourinho are three very different managers and yet they were hired in a sequence that has left United with a squad ill-equipped to achieve its objectives.

A new manager is not going to clear the mess anytime soon. The likely prospect now is that he will be someone who is willing to cooperate with a Director of Football, whenever the belated appointment is made. In theory, the arrival of the latter should help United in directing its focus. But the track record at the club does not inspire confidence.

And what of the current squad? Mourinho botched the job but it is difficult to believe that this team would do better than fight in a race for the Champions League spots. That challenge was obviously beyond Mourinho this season. But a miraculous return to form is not in the offing. The likes of Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku may find it difficult to recover their A-game and confidence swiftly.

For Mourinho, though, it is a moment of truth. Despite the questionable running of the club by the owners and their henchmen, he failed to deflect the attention from himself. It is unlikely that he will take note but it should serve as a lesson to Mourinho that it helps to keep the players on your side. Just look at Rafael Benitez at Newcastle United whose team has punched above its weight yet again; the fans reserve their harsh words only for the owner Mike Ashley. Even Mauricio Pochettino has put the negativity of the summer behind to lead Spurs admirably. A positive relationship with the players can alleviate short-term concerns.

Perhaps, Mourinho will learn that there is middle ground between utmost loyalty and total disdain. But sadly, he tends to like poison a bit too much. His venomous tirades now only chafe, having lost their strain of humour. Tactically, he finds himself at odds with the world that he would dearly love to inhabit. Mourinho's place among the elite football managers is no longer secure. His pragmatism, coupled with the club's risk-averse bungling, is the story of the latest crisis at United.

In the long run, this tenure will be a blot on Mourinho's CV. For United, though, the whole ink bottle has spilt now. The club, after all, already had more than its share of red marks thanks to the Glazers and Woodward. In this moment, both United and Mourinho seem irredeemable but the club hierarchy's reputation cannot be salvaged even by a few trophies.

The road towards redemption for United should begin with Woodward's immediate departure. But it is difficult to foresee even that happening. United's refusal to change tack despite repeated failures is a familiar failing. Another manager will come in but the results are unlikely to improve dramatically if clueless administrators continue to steer this ship. The rosy summer of 2017 will remain a distant feeling for United for some time to come. Now, it is the poets who hum the sweet tunes while the Philistines live a prosaic drama.

""This is the question that India asks the Congress party. For ten years, the Congress party sat on the deal... They did nothing,"" Patra said at a press conference here.

It might be because the Congress was probably used to ""middle men"", ""corrupt means"" and ""graft money"" and that's why they could not reach a conclusion, he alleged.

""This was a government-to-government deal during the era of Prime Minister Narendra Modi,"" the BJP spokesperson said.

Patra, however, expressed confidence that after the apex court judgment, ""not an iota of doubt"" remains in the minds of the people of the country regarding the multi-crore deal.

Dismissing all petitions seeking a court-monitored peobe into alleged irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal, the SC had said that there was no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the procurement of 36 Rafale jets from France.

""Despite all the conclusions by the highest court of the country, we see that Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party are trying to spread lies,"" the BJP leader said.

They try to ""politicise"" the whole issue and ""manufacture lies everyday"" since they have nothing else to offer (to the people), he said.

Patra was speaking as part of the BJP's plan to hold press meets in 70 cities across the country to attack the opposition party against the backdrop of the Supreme Court's verdict on the controversial Rafale deal.

Citing the 29-page judgment, Patra said the apex court had categorically rejected Gandhi's allegation that the BJP government had shown ""favouritism"" towards Anil Ambani's company in connection with choosing the Indian Offset Partner (IOP).

The court had clearly said it did not find any ""substantial material on record"" to show that this was a case of commercial favouritism as the option to choose the IOP does not rest with the Indian government, he said.

Notwithstanding the court's verdict, Rahul Gandhi had said there was massive corruption in the contract.

The Congress has repeatedly criticised the deal, alleging that the government was procuring each of the 36 aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government.

Asked why the BJP had taken a stand against the Supreme Court verdict in the entry of women of menstruating age into Sabarimala shrine issue, he said his party had not questioned the SC judgement.

""No one is questioning the apex court verdict. It is a democratic country and everyone can discuss. We are only questioning the selectivism and extra activism of the Kerala government in the Sabarimala issue,"" he said.

""Rituals have to be respected and selectivism by the state government is something which we condemn,"" he said.

The CPI(M)-led LDF government is not showing the same activism which it had showcased in Sabarimala in a similar case related to a Church in the state, he said, adding that the sensitivity of rituals should be understood.

The ""selectivism"" of the state government and cracking down on a particular community in the name of the court order would only weaken secularism, Patra added.

The BJP government has a ""tradition of lying"" and by lying to the SC it has once again proved that it has no respect for institutions, whether it be the highest court of the land, RBI, CBI or CEC, the APCC spokesperson said.

""The APCC would like to point out that the BJP government's foundation is based on lies - they have been lying to the people of the country since coming to power and now they have been caught lying to the Supreme Court as well"", he said.

""Yogi Adityanath is a promoter of hate politics and is infamous for his communal comments. It is unfortunate that such a person has come to Assam, which is historically known as a land of Pancha-Tirtha (communal harmony) since ages'', the spokesperson said.

The Supreme Court judgement points out how the BJP government at the Centre lied to it, he said.

According to the SC judgement the material placed before it shows that the government has not disclosed pricing details other than the basic price of the aircraft even to the Parliament on the ground that sensitivity of pricing details could affect national security, apart from breaching the agreement between the two countries.

The pricing details have, however, been shared with the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and its report has been examined by the Public Accounts Committee(PAC). But only a ""redacted portion of the report was placed before the Parliament and is in the public domain"", he said.

From the judgement it is seen that the government claims about pricing details being shared with CAG and its report being examined by PAC are nothing but lies as PAC chairman Mallikarjun Kharge has said no reports have been presented either before PAC or by it before Parliament, he said.

""So our question is where is the CAG report and where is the PAC report that has been examined as claimed by the BJP government"", he asked.

On Yogi Adityanath's question on why the Congress led government took so long to go ahead with the purchase of the aircraft, Bordoloi said ""We would like to enlighten the BJP that the requirement for defence aircrafts was communicated to the central government by the IAF in 2001 when the BJP government was in power but they sat on it for three years"".

When Congress came to power in 2004, the process for the tender was started and was completed in December 2007. ""This is normal as it is very technical,"""" he said.

In 2007 the tender was floated and the aircraft of all the six companies who had applied were tested by the IAF, which is a technical requirement, from 2008 to 2012, Bordoloi added.

This is the reason why the Congress never went to the Supreme Court and consistently insisted on a JPC probe, the former Union minister said.

""If the BJP has nothing to hide in this matter, why is it shying away from a JPC probe,"" she asked.

The Supreme Court judgment on the Rafale deal case was based on the ""wrong facts"" presented by the central government, Selja claimed.

The Supreme Court on Friday had dismissed the pleas, saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision-making process"" warranting setting aside of the defence contract for the purchase of 36 Rafale fighter jets.

In its judgment, the court made a reference to a CAG report on the deal. It said the CAG report was examined by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament.

The government, however, said that it was a misinterpretation by the court.

It never said that the CAG report has been examined, but had only described the normal procedure, the government submitted in an affidavit.

But the Congress insisted that the government presented ""wrong facts"" before the court during the hearing of pleas challenging the aircraft deal with France, which gave the government a relief in the cases.

Selja also rubbished the demand of the BJP, which had been seeking Rahul Gandhi's resignation following the SC judgment.

The Rajya Sabha MP hit out at the Narendra Modi government, claiming that it caused a loss of Rs 41,205 crore to the public exchequer by way of purchasing 36 Rafale fighter aircraft from Dassault Aviation at a price of Rs 1,670.70 crore per aircraft, as against the earlier price of Rs 526.10 crore.

She also accused the Modi government of bypassing defence procurement procedures, the cabinet committee on security and the defence acquisition council while announcing the off-the-shelf purchase of the 36 Rafale aircraft.

According to court documents, Pitt's legal representatives filed a motion on Monday asking to be removed as a defendant from the lawsuit, which was filed against both the Oscar winner and his charity the Make it Right Foundation.

Pitt's lawyers argue that the lawsuit ""does not otherwise contain a single factual allegation that Mr. Pitt made any promise to any putative class member, that he entered any contract with any putative class member, or that he made any misrepresentation to any putative class member"".

Furthermore, the actor's attorneys claim that, while the class-action lawsuit levels ""a myriad of purported wrongful conduct"", the plaintiffs in the suit ""do not supply any specific facts indicating that Mr. Pitt was personally involved in any of them"".

The motion comes in response to a recent memorandum filed by the plaintiffs, claiming the actor ""gladly accepted responsibility for his personal participation when the publicity was favourable"", reported etcanada.com.

Pitt is known for featuring in movies like ""Snatch"" and ""Inglourious Basterds"" -- aired in India on Star Movies Select HD.

The axe finally fell on the Portuguese on Tuesday, an increasingly inevitable divorce as Mourinho fell out with senior squad members, blamed his superiors for a lack of backing in the transfer market and oversaw a drastic deterioration in performances and results on the pitch.

Sunday's 3-1 defeat to bitter rivals Liverpool, which left United 19 points off the Premier League leaders after just 17 games, proved the final straw.

After David Moyes and Louis van Gaal, a third manager sacked in four years suggests there is far more to be fixed behind the scenes at the world's richest club than a new name on the manager's door.

Former club captain Gary Neville raged at a club ""rotten to the core"" when rumours over Mourinho's future first circulated and after the Liverpool defeat described United's board as ""so naive it's unbelievable"".

But Mourinho did little to help himself, particularly in a short-lived third season, which has become an unwanted hallmark of his managerial career.

His departure from Old Trafford came a day after the third anniversary of his sacking from a second spell at Chelsea just six months after winning the title with the Blues.

For the first time since leaving provincial Portuguese side Uniao de Leiria for local giants Porto in 2002, Mourinho leaves a club having failed to win a league title.

He did deliver silverware. Winning the League Cup and Europa League in his debut season, and even claiming the Community Shield, a glorified friendly curtain-raiser to the season, as a hat-trick of trophies.

United's highest league finish since Ferguson's retirement followed last season but it was still only second best to local rivals Manchester City and by a record 19-point margin.

- Pogba power struggle -

========================

Pogba sat on the bench for the full 90 minutes at Anfield on Sunday -- he has not started any of United's past three league games.

The French World Cup winner was not alone. Mourinho was stinging in his public criticism of Luke Shaw and Anthony Martial among others.

The man who introduced himself to English football as the ""Special One"" and proved it by delivering Chelsea's first league title for 50 years was now the surly one.

In a recurring theme from his third seasons at Real Madrid and in his second spell at Chelsea, Mourinho's message quickly fell on deaf ears.

Without his confidant and assistant for 17 years, Rui Faria, who left United in May, Mourinho became even more volatile.

The United board also seemed to lose faith just months after handing Mourinho a new contract until 2020 in January.

A number of signing targets earmarked by the manager to improve United's central defence in the summer were apparently deemed no better than options already in the squad by the club's hierarchy, led by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward.

Mourinho's success has always been built on solid foundations. Having not conceded more than twice in one match for 22 months, United shipped three goals each time in defeats to Brighton, Tottenham, West Ham, Manchester City and Liverpool and have already conceded more league goals in the current campaign than in the whole of last season.

However, his cautious nature also clashed with the 20-time English champions' tradition of attacking football.

Even more galling for United fans was to see fierce rivals City and Liverpool under Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp marrying success with entertaining football.

""The most important job of football is entertaining the people because it is only football and nothing else,"" said Klopp earlier this season on his personal duel with Guardiola.

Mourinho has always been more pragmatic. But as his previous spells in Madrid and at Stamford Bridge show, when a results-driven manager starts losing, there is nothing left to save his job.

With a former bureaucrat at the helm of affairs at the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), employees are expecting the return of the old times where everything worked to well-established traditions and norms.

For, the central bank is a tightly bureaucratic, conservative and closed organisation that doesn't take departure from tradition lightly, particularly when it comes to outsiders not aware of the rule book.

That also explains why the central bank worked smoothly with the government when the governor was from the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).

In many ways, it is the culture that the past two governors, Urjit Patel and Raghuram Rajan, upset the most. Not only were they outsiders, they also hired laterally, bypassing the existing talent, especially in the field of economics, when RBI staffers pride themselves on their domain knowledge.

These lateral hires were uneasy arrangements, inviting resentment not easily ameliorated.

It is now for Shaktikanta Das (pictured) to restore that old culture at the RBI, something the central bank staffers want the most.

At least, some of the senior staffers say the past five years had been stressful at the central bank.

Lower-level employees, though, admired Rajan and Patel because both fought with the government on employee rights, especially on the pension issue.

Patel introduced a special medical scheme for retired employees to extend some benefits in lieu of the revised pension scheme.

Das' initial days have been promising, say insiders. Last week, at the L K Jha memorial lecture (Jha was RBI governor and belonged to the Indian Civil Service), the new governor greeted the audience with folded hands. Dignitaries and the guests apart, most of the hall was filled with Reserve Bank employees of all ranks, who felt a connect with the gesture.

""It was an unprecedented gesture in recent memory,"" said a mid-senior level employee present at the event.

Much of this was missing under Rajan and Patel. In the past five years, employees tried hard to adjust to the working styles of the celebrated global economists or ""helicopter drops"" as central bank staffers like to call them, implying that they were specialists brought in at a time of crisis.

Rajan came at a time when the rupee was undergoing a crisis of confidence, plunging every day to record low levels.

Rajan's first-day press conference dramatically reversed the situation.

Patel's rise to the top at the central bank followed a more natural choice, filling the post left vacant by Rajan's non-renewal of contract.

But there was the challenging demonetisation planned for him.

Patel and Rajan were also very different in their personalities.

""Rajan loved to talk, and Patel liked being alone. What the central bank needed was a balanced approach,"" said another senior staff member.

Both Rajan and Patel violated the cardinal principles through their open criticism of the government.

This is something Das is not expected to do even as he could be as much a defender of central bank autonomy as his illustrious predecessors.

In all probability, Das may not agree to transfer the Rs 3 trillion of RBI reserves to the government, even as there could be some increase in yearly pay-outs.

This happened even during Rajan's tenure, when the annual dividend jumped from Rs 360 billion to Rs 57,000 crore under the recomme­ndations of an RBI-appointed committee.

The dividend pay-out continues to remain high and increased every year till demonetisation dented much of it.

Senior RBI executives say all governments have been unreasonable in their demands, but they also know the central bank won't be in a position to entertain those requests.

The whole process is that of an elaborate role play.

The RBI is expected to examine every demand carefully before it is communicated back in mild terms about it being untenable.

""It is never the culture that you go out in public and say that the government has been unreasonable. That sets in motion a number of factors that sends the situation out of control,"" said a senior central banker.

A seasoned bureaucrat who is aware of the hierarchy and egos of various players involved, Das is unlikely to upset visitors.

""My experience of working with IAS officers is that they never do anything that disturbs the balance of the system,"" said another senior official.

This official's past working experience with Das, when he was in the ministry, says the new RBI governor is a level-headed, balanced person, but strictly his own man.

Das is expected to be consultative in his approach, expect the RBI staffers.

The culture of the central bank is not to make a noise but work tirelessly to a shared goal of economic stability, they say.

""It is important to have the communication channel open both internally and with the government. All the present issues have arisen because communication channels were tightly shut,"" said a senior RBI executive.

Das is expected to open up those rusted channels and make the relations between the two warring parties smoother.

The 55-year-old departs Old Trafford after two-and-a-half years with United sixth in the table, 19 points off the top, with only one win in the league since Nov. 3.

Sources have told ESPN FC that Mourinho was informed of the decision on Tuesday morning. Mourinho arrived at the club's Carrington training ground shortly after 9 a.m. and met executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward in person around 9.30 a.m.

ESPN FC has been told that Mourinho was ""completely surprised"" by the decision.

The United board, according to sources, decided to act after growing frustrated with Mourinho's performance in a number of areas, notably first-team results, transfers, development of youth and style of football.

Sources have told ESPN FC that Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino is the preferred choice as permanent boss, although there is an acceptance that Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will fight to keep a coach who has guided the club to three consecutive top-three finishes.

Assistant Michael Carrick and academy chief Nicky Butt will take over in the immediate interim.

A caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the current campaign with a permanent manager put in place ahead of next season. Sources have revealed that the caretaker is likely to be an outside appointment -- although sources say he already has links with United with former players Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Laurent Blanc discussed internally in recent weeks.

United are next in action against Cardiff on Saturday.

A statement issued on Tuesday morning read: ""Manchester United announces that manager Jose Mourinho has left the club with immediate effect. The club would like to thank Jose for his work during his time at Manchester United and to wish him success in the future.

""A new caretaker manager will be appointed until the end of the current season, while the club conducts a thorough recruitment process for a new, full-time manager.""

United's players and staff were given the day off on Monday following the 3-1 loss at Anfield.

Mourinho took charge of United in the summer of 2016 following the departure of Louis van Gaal, winning the Europa League and EFL Cup in his first season.

But although United finished second in the Premier League last season, they were a distant 19 points behind champions Manchester City, lost to Chelsea in the FA Cup final and were knocked out by Sevilla in the round of 16 of the Champions League.

Mourinho signed an extension to his contract in January that could have kept him at Old Trafford until 2021 but there were always growing concerns at board level that no one should feel ""they are bigger than the club.""

He has cut an increasingly frustrated figure -- particularly after the failure to sign a centre-back in the summer.

Mourinho has had high-profile spats with key players, most notably Paul Pogba, throughout 2018 culminating with the France international being stripped of the vice-captaincy in September. Pogba has not been in the United team for the last four Premier League fixtures."

U.S. crude oil fell $2.04, or 4.1 percent, to a low of $47.84, its weakest since September 2017, before recovering to around $48.10 by 0920 GMT.

North Sea Brent crude fell $2.41, or 4.0 percent, to a low of $57.20, a 14-month low, and last traded around $57.61, down $2.00.

Both crude oil benchmarks have shed more than 30 percent since early October due to swelling global inventories.

""A large part of the move (lower) is due to a broader market sell-off, with both U.S. and Asian equity markets coming under pressure,"" said commodities strategist Warren Patterson at Dutch bank ING in Amsterdam.

""Specifically for the oil market, there are no clear signs yet of the market tightening,"" he added.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd), equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices.

But the cuts won't happen until next month and meanwhile production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia, undermining spot prices.

Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point for the oil futures contract, rose more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.

The United States has surpassed Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest oil producer, with total crude output climbing to a record 11.7 million bpd.

With prices falling, unprofitable shale producers will eventually stop operating and cut supply, but that could take some time, and meanwhile inventories keep growing.

""Rising U.S. shale production levels along with a deceleration in global economic growth have threatened to offset OPEC+ efforts,"" said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, at Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures.

The Supreme Court may have given its seal of approval to the Rafale deal. But, after Friday's landmark judgment, more people will now certainly subscribe to the theory that something was fishy in the deal. And, the credit for this must go to the 'shoddily written' judgment of the Supreme Court.

And, the court has only itself to blame for receiving brickbats for the judgment. It should have either stayed away from the sensitive matter, or dealt with all the issues raised by the petitioners. Cherry-picking issues to adjudicate doesn't show our highest court in a very good light - either go into the entire issue or leave it to the politicians to fight it out.

The Rafale judgment is a prime example of the perils of trying to dispense justice through sealed envelopes.

If one of the most critical parts of the judgment, which says there was nothing wrong in the contract cost-wise, is based on the material provided to the court in a sealed cover, either the court shouldn't have based its order on that material or allowed petitioners to access it and given them a chance to rebut the government's claims.

But the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, did the exact opposite. And in doing so, it was unfair to the petitioners.

More worryingly, the judgment is also a poor reflection of the judges' understanding of how other institutions under the Constitution function.

If one assumes that the Centre is not misrepresenting facts when it claims that the mistake in Paragraph 25 of the Rafale judgment, which is at the heart of the controversy due to the 'grammatical' errors, was introduced by the judiciary, it only shows that the judges didn't bother to understand how defence deals are looked into by the country's official auditor - the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

If the judges got the impression that the CAG report on Rafale had indeed been submitted in Parliament and had been sent to the Public Accounts Committee, should the court be hearing the case?

Our judges do read newspapers and many of them are in the know of developments around them, either directly or through their interns. So, why didn't the judges check if such a CAG report actually existed?

Also read: SC on Rafale PILs: Setback for Rahul's campaign or lesson not to politicise defence deals?

Since the pricing and other details of the mega deal were submitted to the court in ""sealed covers"", with one of the notes being in ""bullet points"", how do we know what was actually there inside the sealed covers? The note in bullet points reportedly carried the critical paragraph about the Narendra Modi government having already shared the pricing details with the CAG and the CAG report being examined by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, and that ""only a redacted version of the report is placed before the Parliament and in public domain"".

Also, one wonders from where exactly the bench got the impression that the Chief of the Air Staff had ""communicated his reservation regarding the disclosure of the pricing details, including regarding the weaponry which could adversely affect national security"".

Was that too part of the sealed cover? If yes, didn't the petitioners deserve to see that too?

Having allowed grammatical mistakes to creep into their judgment, the judges must certainly be wondering if they could have dealt with the issue with more due diligence.

Needless to say, whatever the court does now, in this case, it will be viewed with scepticism. The credibility of the court's judgment hangs on a grammatical point.

Doesn't the country have the right to know how not one but three judges, including the Chief Justice of India, Ranjan Gogoi, got such an important point wrong?

Now that the government has filed an application suggesting the exact changes that the court must make in the judgment so as to ensure that the ""controversy being raised in the public domain"" is put to an end, will the judges play along or recall the entire judgment?

More importantly, will the court finally realise the folly of trying to adjudicate sensitive issues via sealed envelopes? Also, the court had itself said that it was only ""proceeding in the matter in order to satisfy itself of the correctness of the decision­-making process"" and that it would not go into the ""issue of pricing or matters relating to technical suitability of the equipment (in the tendered fighter aircraft)"". Will the court now admit that it is wading into the other issues as well?

The Supreme Court is the highest court of the land, one tasked with protecting our rights. It needs to check the growing tendency to needlessly jump or be dragged into what are essentially political issues. Otherwise, errors, like the ones in the Rafale judgment, will continue to creep in, dragging down the court's prestige and power.

PS: Guess who was the lead petitioner in the Rafale case? It is none other than one Manohar Lal Sharma, the same lawyer who was fined Rs 50,000 by a bench headed by CJI on 7 December for filing a frivolous PIL against finance minister Arun Jaitley. The bench also directed that ""until cost amount is paid no PIL filed by Shri Manohar Lal Sharma, Advocate, will be entertained and put up before the Court"".

On Monday, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.4% at 97.054. Market expectations for 2019 Fed rate increases, once put at three to four more increases, have also begun to lessen on the back of dovish comments from Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell.

Economic data at Wall Street showed that the Empire Manufacturing Survey for December checked in at 10.9 for December (consensus 20.0), down from 23.3 in November, with a deceleration seen across almost every category. A number above 0.0 still connotes expansion, yet it is clear to see that activity decelerated in December; moreover, the report indicates that optimism about the six-month outlook was slightly more tempered than in November.

Separately, the NAHB Housing Market Index for December came in at 56 ( consensus 61), down from 60 in November. The drop reflects deteriorating confidence in housing market conditions, although it needs to be noted that the dividing line between optimism and pessimism is 50.0.

Traders are therefore also looking forward to speech by President Xi Jinping, to be delivered Tuesday morning in Beijing on the topic of economic reform, for any hints as to the trajectory of trade negotiations.

Bullion prices ended higher at Comex on Monday, 17 December 2018. Gold climbed on Monday, with declines in a leading dollar index, Treasury yields and the U.S. stock market, as well as comments from a well-known fund manager, prompting prices to settle at their highest in just over a week. The gains in gold come ahead of key central-bank policy decisions this week and uncertainty around concrete trade developments between the U.S. and China.

Gold for February delivery on Comex added $10.40, or 0.8%, to settle at $1,251.80 an ounce. March silver rose 0.8% to $14.759 an ounce, with prices settling around 0.4% lower for last week.

Oil futures declined on Monday, 17 December 2018 with U.S. prices below $50 a barrel and marking their lowest settlement in more than a year. The market failed to stabilize after a weekly loss, with prices suffering additional pressure from data that reportedly revealed a jump in crude stocks at the U.S. trading hub.

January West Texas Intermediate crude fell $1.32, or 2.6%, to settle at $49.88 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the lowest finish for a front-month contract since Oct. 9, 2017.

On Monday, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, was down 0.4% at 97.054. Gold is often sensitive to movements in the dollar. A weaker U.S. unit typically boosts demand for commodities priced in dollars as it makes them less expensive to users of other currencies.

This temporary cut to production will commence in January 2019, with an initial decrease of 325,000 barrels per day (b/d) (approximately 8.7% of Alberta's current production). The curtailment will be applied at the operator level, with several dozen operators to be issued curtailment orders to reduce their production.

The Curtailment Rules provide that the minister of energy may ""fix the combined amount of crude oil and bitumen that may be produced by each operator."" The first 10,000 b/d of an operator's production are exempt from curtailment and operators with less than 10,000 b/d of production of crude oil and bitumen will not be subject to a curtailment order.

Implementation is left in the hands of industry. Two or more operators that are issued curtailment orders may apply to have the maximum amounts set out in such orders merged or redistributed among themselves. Additionally, the Rules contemplate allocation agreements between persons carrying on business in a partnership or a joint venture whereby they may allocate production among themselves to meet an applicable curtailment order. The Rules, however, do not provide guidance about the provisions that such allocation agreements should include.

Producers with less than 10,000 b/d were intended to be exempt from the mandatory curtailment. However, it is not apparent this objective will be achieved. There may be situations where a smaller, non-operating producer's lands are jointly owned and operated by an operator who is subject to a curtailment order. In this situation, the Rules do not prohibit the operator from curtailing production from the jointly owned lands and consequently impacting a smaller producer who was intended to be exempt. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) is to establish a panel to hear concerns about the curtailment. However, no further clarity on how disputes will be resolved has been provided.

The Rules also do not include any guidelines for an operator to determine how to satisfy a curtailment order. Operators required to curtail production have discretion on how to achieve their required reduction. While a logical curtailment solution for an operator may be to shut in its most uneconomic production, the legal and operational impacts of doing so must also be considered.

An operator's discretion in choosing which production to shut in is not absolute. An operator must be cautious and ensure it does not breach a legal or equitable duty owed to its joint venture partners, including potential fiduciary and duty of good faith obligations.

The precise nature of an operator's legal and equitable duties to its partners is not fully settled in the oil and gas context and depends on the circumstances of each contractual relationship. However, an operator may be legally vulnerable if it curtails production in a manner that adversely affects its joint venture partners, even though the operator is in compliance with a curtailment order in doing so.

Force majeure can suspend a party's contractual obligations when it is prevented from performing its obligations for reasons outside of its control. Government action (or inaction), including change in law, is often included as a type of force majeure.

Shutting in production in response to a curtailment order may result in an operator breaching its contractual obligations to third parties.

If the operator were to be issued a curtailment order for specific wells, it could likely claim force majeure for any breach of contract due to the shut-in. However, in the present case, operators have discretion to decide which wells will be shut in. It will be therefore more difficult to prove that ""government action"" has required the operator to shut in any specific well, which may limit the likelihood of success of claiming force majeure should a breach of contract claim arise from the shut-in.

Operators will also need to be mindful of the terms of any freehold leases when implementing their reductions as a curtailment order will not necessarily excuse an operator's lack of production under a freehold lease.

When shutting in wells, the habendum clause (which sets out how the lease is to continue past the primary term) and the shut-in well clause will need to be considered, along with whether there is other production from the lands that may continue the lease if wells are to be shut-in. The shut-in well clause will need to be examined to ensure it may be relied upon in such circumstances and that all of the requirements of the clause are met.

The mandatory curtailment has been viewed positively by a large part of the industry in Alberta, but not universally. With the implementation being left largely in the hands of industry, industry participants will need to work together to achieve the curtailment's intended purpose with limited disruption. While a curtailment order will require certain operators to take action to curtail production, this may not excuse the operator from continuing to meet its legal obligations to third parties. Affected operators will need to be mindful of avoiding unintended legal consequences when implementing the required curtailment.

Directive 2019-01 rescinds the agency's Active Case Enforcement (""ACE"") process and instead requires OFCCP staff to conduct compliance evaluations according to the Federal Contractor Compliance Manual (""FCCM"") and the supplemental guidance that the agency has issued. Directive 2019-02 establishes a process for concluding compliance evaluations using Early Resolution Procedures (""ERP"") in order to reduce the length of compliance evaluations. Directive 2019-03 implements procedures for the agency to issue opinion letters and FAQs in order to offer clarity around specific compliance questions that contractors may have.

On November 30th, the OFCCP issued a series of new directives as part of Acting Director Craig Leen's continuing efforts to increase the transparency and efficiency of the compliance review process. The first two of these new directives rescind the often criticized ACE process and outline procedures for utilizing ERP in order to shorten the overly lengthy compliance evaluation process. The third directive summarizes the agency's process for issuing opinion letters and FAQs to address compliance questions from the contractor community.

This directive explicitly rescinds the ACE procedures which ""required full OFCCP desk audits under all three legal authorities"" and ""increased the frequency of mandatory onsite review"" for supply and service audits. This focus on a more all-encompassing audit process ultimately caused ""the number of OFCCP compliance reviews"" to gradually decline and ""overall processing time"" to increase. In contrast, the Active Case Management (""ACM"") process which the ACE replaced, ""focused enforcement efforts on cases with indicators of systemic discrimination under the Executive Order, through abbreviated and generally shorter desk audits."" The directive notes that in the time since Directive 2011-01 established the ACE procedures, the agency has adopted ""valuable components"" of the ACE and the ACM into various operating policies and that ""there is no longer the need for the ACE directive as a freestanding guidance document.""

The directive instructs OFCCP staff to follow the compliance evaluation procedures outlined in the FCCM and subsequent guidance and policies issued by the agency. The directive specifically mentions that the agency will continue to publish its scheduling methodology, that establishments which have undergone a compliance review in the prior 24 months will be exempted from further review, and that compliance officers should prioritize proactive correction of perceived deficiencies at the desk audit phase rather than proceeding to onsite review when it identifies ""non-material violations with no additional indicators of discrimination.""

Like the directive rescinding the ACE procedures, this directive is aimed at continuing Acting Director Leen's mission of making OFCCP a more efficient and transparent agency. The Directive notes that OFCCP intends to use ""innovative approaches to increase contractor compliance, reach more establishments, and remedy violations more quickly for the benefit of employees, applicants and contractors."" The directive further explains that the goal of the ERP is to ensure ""equal employment opportunity in federal contracting and reduce the length of compliance evaluations through early and efficient resolutions."" Finally, it is important to note that the ERP will only be used in situations where the contractor agrees to utilize the procedures.

The directive explains how the ERP applies to three different types of situations: non-material violations, material violations: non-discrimination, and material violations: discrimination.

The ERP for non-material violations follows OFCCP's current practice of working with the contractor to immediately correct the deficiency where no other indicators of discrimination exist as part of the desk audit review and then issuing a closure letter identifying the problem and how it was addressed. The example given for this type of violation is a non-conforming element of the affirmative action plan.

The ERP for material violations: non-discrimination states that if, upon completing a desk audit review, OFCCP finds some kind of material violation by a contractor with multiple establishments, such as recordkeeping problems or failures to implement an audit and reporting system, it will seek to resolve these problems through an Early Resolution Conciliation Agreement (""ERCA"") which requires the contractor to review all of its establishments and ensure that the deficiency found during the desk audit is corrected. As part of the ERCA, the contractor will submit progress reports outlining corrective action taken at each establishment that it reviews, as well as any additional progress reporting required for the establishment originally scheduled for review. The original scheduled establishment will be under progress report monitoring for a portion of the five year period for which the ERCA is in place. During that five year period, the OFCCP will not schedule a compliance evaluation for the original establishment though all other establishments, including those on whom the contractor reports as part of the ERCA, will be open to review. While this seems to offer extended relief from audits, in fact the only relief falls upon the actual facility being audited and it offers the OFCCP data and review of all other included facilities to which it would not otherwise have access without a scheduled audit.

Similar to the ERP for material violations: non-discrimination, the OFCCP will attempt to conciliate any potential violations at the conclusion of the desk audit review and such conciliation will cover all of the contractors facilities (or a negotiated subset which is agreed upon between the contractor and the agency). Where the two processes differ is that in the case of an ERCA for material violations related to discrimination, all of the facilities that the contractor agrees to review are: 1) subject to relief for identified violations; 2) required to submit to semi-annual progress reporting for a five-year period; and 3) are exempt from further compliance reviews for the five-year period covered by the ERCA. As with the material non-discrimination issues, this exposes the bulk, if not the contractor's entire workforce, to audit and review and results in a wealth of critical data being submitted to the OFCCP.

This directive continues the OFCCP's recent efforts to ""ensure contractors have sufficient, practical, and timely compliance assistance resources to understand and fully meet equal employment opportunity obligations."" As part of these efforts, the OFCCP operates a Help Desk which allows employers and their employees to seek technical assistance by phone which may then be converted into Frequently Asked Questions (""FAQs"") for broader use by the contractor community. The OFCCP also seeks to provide technical assistance by issuing fact-specific Opinion Letters which are in response to a particular situation, but may also provide broader guidance around generally applicable topics such as OFCCP jurisdiction and exemptions.

In order to enhance its abilities in these areas, the directive calls upon OFCCP staff to develop a ""searchable publicly available source of Help Desk questions and answers"" and create a process for ""issuing Opinion Letters that provide guidance on the application of OFCCP regulations to fact-specific situations that follow the criteria in this directive."" The increased focus on these two forms of guidance is another example of the agency's efforts to become more transparent and to empower the contractor community to take a more pro-active and cooperative approach to compliance. The directive also notes that compliance evaluation determinations will take into account whether contractors have ""acted consistently and in good faith with an Opinion Letter, Directive, FAQ, Help Desk answer, or other OFCCP guidance.""

On their face, these directives continue to signal that OFCCP is serious about forging a more transparent and cooperative relationship with the contractor community. As with previous directives, the agency is touting its desire to shorten the length of compliance reviews and directives 2019-01 and 2019-02 will both give the agency greater flexibility to try and achieve that goal. Under DIR 2019-01, the OFCCP will no longer be beholden to the mandatory onsite review prescribed by the ACE. Additionally, OFCCP compliance officers may now be more willing to close audits after contractors respond to initial inquiries rather than dragging out the process. Similarly, DIR 2019-02 gives compliance officers a pathway for addressing potential violations before proceeding to an onsite review which may save contractors from both the cost and business disruption of defending onsite reviews. The expanded exemption available under DIR 2019-02 allows contractors whose systems are out of compliance additional time to correct the deficiencies before receiving another audit. Finally, the Opinion Letters and Help Desk responses can be helpful resources for contractors to better understand the often murky waters of OFCCP compliance. It is worth noting that while EEOC Guidance is subject to the Notice and Comment Rulemaking process, the DIR 2019-03 does not appear to contemplate a similar publication requirement for OFCCP Opinion Letters. Such a requirement may ultimately end up as part of the process that the agency creates for issuing Opinion Letters, however, if not, the OFCCP could use Opinion Letters to establish broad reaching policy without any input from the contractor community.

By Matt Stevens, Sarah Mervosh and Andrew R. Chow

Julian Niccolini, the face of the Four Seasons Restaurant in Manhattan who for years had weathered sexual misconduct allegations, was forced to resign Monday, the restaurant said in a statement.

Niccolini, 65, was told to resign by Alex von Bidder, a co-owner with whom he had operated the restaurant since the mid-1990s, according to the restaurant. The restaurant had been located at its original home in the Seagram Building for decades before it closed in July 2016 after losing its lease. It reopened four months ago in a smaller space on the other side of Park Avenue.

""It had been hoped that Mr Niccolini would fulfill the agreement he made in 2016 to seek help and change his behavior during the Four Seasons' two-year hiatus while the new restaurant was under construction,"" the restaurant said in a statement Monday. ""In the short period of time since the restaurant had reopened, it had become clear that he had not honored that commitment.

Advertising

""Creating a warm and respectful environment for staff and patrons alike is central to the exceptional fine dining experience for which the Four Seasons has come to be known,"" the statement added.

A spokeswoman for the Four Seasons declined to elaborate on what had happened since the restaurant reopened.

The terms of his resignation were unclear; it is possible that a financial agreement could be worked out in the coming weeks.

Niccolini did not respond to a phone call and text message seeking comment on Monday evening. In September, Niccolini said he had ""dealt with"" the sexual assault allegations against him. ""It is something of the past,"" he told The New York Times.

This month, Pete Wells, the New York Times restaurant critic, reviewed the newly relocated Four Seasons, downgrading it to one star from the two it received in 2007 -- not because of the food (Wells wrote that the restaurant is ""better than it has been in years"") but because ""Mr Niccolini's actions have done serious damage"" to its ability to make a diner feel safe in an intimate space.

Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the Four Seasons, said Wells' review did not play a role in Niccolini's departure.

Niccolini is a minority shareholder in the restaurant, McGillion said. There are 40 to 50 other investors, she said, noting that Niccolini's share of the restaurant is in the single digits.

Von Bidder did not respond to multiple requests for comment about Niccolini's removal, which The New York Post first reported on Monday afternoon.

Niccolini is the latest high-profile figure in the food world to fall from grace over accusations of sexual misconduct. Although he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault a year and a half before The Times published an article on the predatory behavior of Harvey Weinstein in October 2017, several famous restaurateurs have been accused in the months since as the #MeToo movement has grown. Mario Batali's restaurant empire removed his name from the company; he lost licensing deals and a TV contract. Other prominent chefs, like John Besh in New Orleans, and Charlie Hallowell in Oakland, California, also stepped away from their restaurants after allegations emerged.

The Four Seasons Restaurant, which opened in 1959, had lost much of its luster by the early 1970s, when two new owners, Tom Margittai and Paul Kovi, began a rejuvenation and hired Niccolini. Under their direction, it became a lunchtime magnet for the powerful and famous of New York, including Jacqueline Onassis, Henry Kissinger, Martha Stewart, Nora Ephron, Liz Smith, Barry Diller and Bill Blass.

Niccolini became the public face of the restaurant, greeting diners and drawing up the all-important seating chart. His flirtatious demeanor at the restaurant landed him the nickname ""Naughty Niccolini.""

Niccolini has been dogged by allegations of misconduct for decades.

In 1991, one of the restaurant's waitresses sued Niccolini and the Four Seasons, citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her ""slut,"" ""lesbian"" and other things. Niccolini denied the charges. By 1994, von Bidder and Niccolini became the restaurant's primary operating partners.

In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Niccolini, von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both lawsuits were settled.

Then, in June 2015, Niccolini was charged with felony sexual abuse after a 28-year-old woman told investigators that Niccolini had tried to kiss her in the bar of the Four Seasons, touching her legs and buttocks and pulling her toward him. He reached through an opening in the back of her dress, tugged on her bra until it ripped and tried to pull down her stockings, a criminal complaint said, adding that she had scratches and bruises from the encounter.

Nine months later, in March 2016, Niccolini pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in a deal with prosecutors to resolve the allegation. He was sentenced by a judge to ""conditional discharge,"" meaning he would not be required to serve jail time unless he broke the law over the course of 12 months.

Niccolini and von Bidder ran the restaurant in the Seagram Building until their lease expired in 2016 and the building's new owners replaced them, prompting the Four Seasons' move to 42 E. 49th St."

(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Monday scrambled to contain fallout from a Reuters report that the healthcare conglomerate knew for decades that cancer-causing asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder, taking out full-page newspaper ads defending its product and practices, and readying its chief executive for his first television interview since investors erased tens of billions of dollars from the company's market value.

J&J shares fell nearly 3 percent Monday, closing at $129.14 in New York Stock Exchange trading. That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about $40 billion of the company's market capitalisation following the Reuters report https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer Friday. J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock.

Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety.

J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, was scheduled to appear on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that ""any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

A Monday full-page ad from J&J -- headlined ""Science. Not sensationalism."" -- ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The ad asserted that J&J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use. ""If we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe, it would be off our shelves,"" the ad said.

J&J rebutted Reuters' report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky. In the written critique, posted on the company's website, J&J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organisation that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate's Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer; that J&J's baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos-free; and that the company has cooperated with the U.S. FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades.

""Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J's Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,"" Gorsky said in the video. He added that regulators ""have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.""

A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency ""stands by its reporting.""

Reuters' investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J&J talc and talc products, tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991, as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits, found small amounts of asbestos. In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called ""incontrovertible asbestos"" in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J's own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s.

The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company's talc.

The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991.

The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with ""independent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.""

That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives.

The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined ""Conclusions from Global Authorities"" that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have ""reviewed and analysed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.""

On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed.

The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a ""consistent and statistically significant positive association"" between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic.

A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. ""We chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,"" the spokeswoman said.

While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year.

J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock.

Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety.

J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, was scheduled to appear on CNBC's ""Mad Money"" with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that ""any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

""It's quite a sensitive situation,"" Martin Alvarez, an expert with the Observatorio Petrolero Sur charity that monitors energy use, told AFP.

""It's affecting the inhabitants of popular neighborhoods because the waste treatment plants are too close."" Following an investigation, Greenpeace published a report in which it accused Total and British-Dutch group Shell -- which does not figure in the Mapuche lawsuit -- of dumping ""highly toxic oily sludge waste.""

It claimed that the residue from fracking ""is being tipped in illegal waste dumps, causing massive pollution that threatens wildlife and human health"" in Patagonia.

Much of the area is taken up by protected national parks. Greenpeace said it found the dumps in November last year and started taking samples from them in May.

It said it had tracked trucks dumping waste to two sites, one linked to Shell and the other to Total.

The dumps, including one which has grown to the size of ""almost 15 football fields,"" are located just three miles from Anelo, Greenpeace said.

While Shell is not named in the lawsuit, it signed a deal in 2017 with Argentine state-run oil company YPF SA to develop oil and gas assets in the Vaca Muerta shale field, a site of some 11,600 square miles.

A Pan American Energy spokesman told AFP that its name featured in the lawsuit by mistake as it doesn't have a contract with Treater, which operates the waste plants.

On its website, Treater identifies Pan American Energy -- whose other partner, Argentine company Bridas, is 50 per cent owned by Chinese giant CNOOC -- as one of its clients. None of the other companies named in the lawsuit commented.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Monday, with U.S. crude hitting the lowest since September 2017, on signs of oversupply in the United States and as investor sentiment remained under pressure from concern over global economic growth and fuel demand.

Brent crude oil fell 67 cents, or 1.11 percent, to settle at $59.61 a barrel after dropping to a session low of $58.83 a barrel. U.S. crude dropped $1.32, or 2.58 percent to end the session at $49.88 a barrel and tumbled to a low of $49.09 a barrel.

By Nathan Layne

(Reuters) - An ex-business partner of former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and a businessman with ties to Turkish government officials were charged with undisclosed lobbying aimed at ensuring the extradition of a Muslim cleric living in the United States.

Flynn's former partner, Bijan Rafiekian, was indicted on two criminal counts in the Eastern District of Virginia, including conspiracy to act as an agent of a foreign government, according to a grand jury indictment unsealed on Monday.

Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman, was also charged for allegedly plotting with government ministers in Turkey to discredit and cause the extradition of Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and for lying to the FBI about his efforts.

The probe into the Turkish lobbing effort had been under the purview of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 U.S. election before being handed back to federal prosecutors in Virginia earlier this year.

Flynn, who is due to be sentenced on Tuesday for lying to the FBI related to his contacts with the Russian ambassador, has also admitted to lying about his role in the Turkish lobbying effort and has been cooperating with prosecutors on the probe.

The indictment alleges that Rafiekian and Alptekin made false statements about the project in filings to the Department of Justice unit that governs a law requiring that lobbying on behalf of foreign interests be disclosed.

""The defendants sought to discredit and delegitimize the Turkish citizen in the eyes of politicians and the public, and ultimately to secure the Turkish citizen's extradition,"" attorneys for the Eastern District of Virginia said in the indictment.

FETHULLAH GULEN

While the Turkish citizen was not named, the person fits the description of Gulen, a one-time ally of Erdogan who lives in a compound in rural Pennsylvania.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has blamed Gulen for stoking a failed coup against him in 2016. Gulen denies that.

A representative for Alptekin, 41, who was charged with six criminal counts, said she did not immediately have a comment.

A lawyer for Rafiekian, 66, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Turkey has since 2016 pushed the U.S. Justice Department to extradite Gulen, but those requests were rebuffed because they lacked sufficient evidence under extradition treaty and U.S. law, the indictment says.

Turkey's foreign minister said on Sunday that U.S. President Donald Trump has told Erdogan that Washington was working on extraditing Gulen.

The indictment alleges Rafiekian and Alptekin sought to mask the involvement of Turkey's government by paying the Flynn Intel Group roughly $600,000 in fees through a Netherlands-based company, Inovo, which was controlled Alptekin.

Justice Department filings in 2017 show that Flynn's consulting firm routed $80,000 in ""consultancy fees"" back to Inovo. Alptekin has previously described those payments as reimbursements for consulting work that was never finished.

The indictment says the $80,000 was part of a pre-arranged plan to kick back 20 percent of the project to Alptekin.

Alptekin, who was chairman of the Turkey-U.S. Business Council, told Reuters in prior interviews that the payments to Flynn came from his personal funds and from Inovo. He has rejected allegations that he was being directed by the Turkish government.

The indictment cites an email from Alptekin to Rafiekian and another person in August 2016 in which Alptekin says that he had just spoken about the project to discredit Gulen with two Turkish ministers and had a ""green light to discuss confidentiality, budget and the scope of the contract.""

He said they should reveal the source of information for their charges on the fighter jet dealwhen the Narendra Modi government purchased the aircraft in a transparent manner.

""We want to ask Rahul Gandhi the reasons for abruptly stopping the acquisition process, which was completed in 2012. Was it stopped for any mediator?

Rahul Gandhi has to answer the country on it and also on who gave him the false information through which he spread the lies.

Is this information given by forces who don't want to see the country strong or from those who wanted to be part of this deal, but were unable to sell the aircraft? Rahul Gandhi needs to throw some light,"" Fadnavis said.

He further alleged that it has been the history of Congress to indulge in scams in defence acquisitions and claimed that it cannot tolerate the fact that a government has completed the deal without any mediator.

""The Congress should keep politics aside and think of the countrys interests first,"" he said.

Fadnavis said that there are certain things related to national security which cannot be publicly deliberated and the Congress took advantage of that only.

This particular deal was between two countries and bound by certain agreements and those disclosures cannot be made before everybody, he said.

He claimed that the cost of new procurement was lower than the earlier one, but Congress was spreading lies, despite knowing it.

On the Congress demand for a JPC, the Maharashtra Chief Minister said that the Supreme Court order was very clear and under the Constitution, no JPC has the power to overrule the Apex Court judgement.

""So now the JPC has become irrelevant. The Congress also knows that under the Constitution, no JPC can scrutinise a Supreme Court order or overrule its order.

Still, just to spread confusion among people and to stick to its lies, which has fallen utterly flat, they are talking about this JPC...maturity from Congress party and its president is required.I think it is high time that they should shut their mouths and apologise to the nation,""Fadnavis added.

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets, saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision making process"" warranting setting aside of the contract.

The Congress has repeatedly criticised the deal for the 36 Rafale jets,alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the previous UPA government.

The government has, however, denied any irregularity in the deal.

The chief minister was speaking as part of the BJP's move to hold press conferences in 70 cities across the country to attack the opposition party against the backdrop of the Supreme Court's verdict on the Rafale jet deal last week.

""Even if all thieves come together and call the chowkidar a thief, the people will not accept it,"" Rupani told reporters here, referring to Gandhi's barb against the prime minister.

Rupani said only ""those who are afraid of the 'chowkidar' make repeated noise about thieves. But, the people know the truth"".

Rupani also came down heavily on Gandhi for raising questions over the deal even after the apex court held that there were no irregularities in it.

The Gujarat chief minister said there should be no doubt on the decision-making process in the procurement of Rafale jets from France.

""We are ready for a debate on the issue. After the Supreme Court made it clear that there is no irregularity, there should be no question of a probe into the matter,"" Rupani said.

According to the agency's lawyer, the government is working to extradite Saxena back to India.

The move comes a fortnight after the alleged middleman in AgustaWestland VVIP chopper deal, Christian Michel, was extradited from the UAE to India.

According to the Enforcement Directorate (ED), both Michel and Saxena, along with others, were part of a chain through which the ""proceeds of crime"" were laundered.

On Saxena's application, the court sought response from the ED by December 24, when it will next hear the matter.

The court also asked senior advocate Geeta Luthra, appearing for Saxena, to take instruction from her client as to when he may come to India and join the probe.

Michel, a British national, was extradited from Dubai to India earlier this month and is currently in the CBI custody in a related case.

The court has already issued non-bailable warrant (NBW) against Saxena in the case. However, the accused has filed an application before it seeking cancellation of the NBW.

The accused, a non-resident, currently residing in Palm Jumeriah, Dubai, has been living in the UAE for last 26 years.

In his application, Saxena said that ""he undertakes to appear before this court. However, the applicant is filing the instant application as he apprehends his arrest by the respondent"".

""It would be a travesty of justice to allow the respondent (ED) to confine the applicant to any form of detention,"" the application said.

It claimed that even as per ED's charge sheet, the other accused who have committed more grave offence than Saxena, such as Gautam Khaitan and SP Tyagi, are out on bail and ""there can be no justification to deny the applicant grant of anticipatory bail"".

Saxena claimed he had no antecedent in any crime or illegal activities in the past and asserted that he was ""innocent"".

He also told the court that he was seeking the relief on medical grounds as he was ""an extremely sick person with advanced terminal diseases"", including an advanced stage leukemia (blood cancer).

Maintaining that AgustaWestland had paid Euro 58 million as kickbacks through two Tunisia-based firms, the ED has alleged that ""these companies further siphoned off the said money in the name of consultancy contracts to M/s Interstellar Technologies Limited, Mauritius and others which were further transferred to M/s UHY Saxena and M/s Matrix Holdings Ltd, Dubai and others"".

Saxena is one of the accused named in the charge sheet filed by the ED. Michel, former AgustaWestland and Finmeccanica directors Giuseppe Orsi and Bruno Spagnolini, ex-IAF chief S P Tyagi and Saxena's wife Shivani Saxena were also named by the agency.

It was alleged by the probe agency that the two Dubai-based firms were the entities ""through which the proceeds of crime have been routed and further layered and integrated in buying the immovable properties/ shares, among others"" in this case.

""Saxena has transferred proceeds of crime from M/s Interstellar to his Dubai based companies M/s UHY Saxena and M/s Matrix Holdings Ltd,"" ED said in its charge sheet.

The agency claimed its probe had found that AgustaWestland, United Kingdom, had ""paid an amount of Euro 58 million as kickbacks"" through two Tunisia-based firms.

On January 1, 2014, India had scrapped the contract with Finmeccanica's British subsidiary AgustaWestland for supplying 12 AW-101 VVIP choppers to the IAF over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of kickbacks of Rs 423 crore paid by it to secure the deal.

""They (Congress) tried to push the government (Centre) to the dock and spread misinformation about the Army and country's security,"" Adityanath said at a press conference here.

He claimed the Supreme Court had cleared the NDA government at the Centre ""on the three contentious aspects"" of the Rafale deal and that the Congress should respect the verdict.

""It raises questions on the Congress' leadership. The Congress is the oldest party and their leaders are expected to be more responsible. But unfortunately in an irresponsible manner, it is telling a lie 100 times to make it a truth,"" Adityanath said.

The process to purchase the Rafale jets started in 2007, but it was inordinately delayed by the UPA government headed by the Congress only because they could not find any middle man like Quattrocchi or Christian Michel, both of whom are accused in scams, the UP CM alleged.

Without naming anyone, Adityanath alleged that all defence deals done by the Congress government had the involvement of middlemen and that Ottavio Quattrocchi is very close to the top leadership of the Congress party.

""In 2014, when Modiji came to power a government-to-government deal was signed and the process was expeditiously completed. The Supreme Court cleared the deal and acknowledged the facts related to the security of the country. Congress played with the country's security,"" he said.

When asked if Rahul Gandhi raking up the Rafale issue aggressively in all of his public meetings had any impact on the recent Assembly election defeats the BJP suffered, Adityanath refrained from giving a direct reply.

""The Congress is spreading misinformation in the entire country. Rahul Gandhi crossed all levels of decency. The statements made against the Prime Minister were unpardonable crime. He (Gandhi) should apologise,"" he added.

Adityanath questioned the opposition's demand for a probe by the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in the Rafale deal, saying the ""JPC is only a committee"" and that the Supreme Court has already examined all the aspects before okaying the deal.

""Why did Rahul Gandhi not go to the Supreme Court before? If there is anything wrong why not discuss it in Parliament? Our government is ready to discuss it.

""Congress is escaping a discussion. The only intention of the Congress is to stall the Parliament proceedings,"" he added.

On Friday, the Supreme Court had dismissed any corruption in the Rs 59,000-crore Rafale jet deal and dismissed all petitions asking for an investigation.

The Congress has been relentlessly alleging that the government scrapped the previous deal to sign a new one to help businessman Anil Ambani's company bag an offset contract with Dassault. The costs jumped in this deal, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has alleged.

But the court, while dismissing the need for a probe, said, ""There is no evidence of commercial favouritism to any private entity.

Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad sent the notice to the Upper House chairman, while Congress' leader in the Lok Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, gave the notice in the Lower House.

""I have given a breach of privilege notice against the government and, in particular, against Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad as it was the Law Ministry that gave the go ahead for presenting the affidavit before the Supreme Court,"" Azad said.

""It is understood that the affidavit was in the knowledge of the prime minister, which provided wrong information. This government can speak a lie even to the Supreme Court and send a wrong affidavit to it and thus mislead the Parliament and the entire country. We have no faith in such a government,"" he said, adding it was for the first time that a government had provided wrong information to the Supreme Court.

""This is why our demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) becomes more relevant. We demand that a JPC be formed to probe the theft in the Rafale deal,"" Azad said, noting that they would continue to make the demand till the government accepts it.

Another Congress leader, Kapil Sibal, said this government was trying to mislead the Supreme Court as well as the entire country. ""It is a sin to do politics of lies. This sinful government will have to suffer.""

Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said it was a serious issue as ""misrepresentation and falsehood"" of facts before the Supreme Court calls for contempt of court.

""There is a direct infringement of parliamentary privilege. You have tried to mislead the court to get a stamp of approval on false facts like CAG, like PAC, like HAL. All of which have a direct connection with the discussions, content and direction of parliamentary work. (The) CAG and (the) PAC fall exclusively in the parliamentary domain.

""What is your attempt? Your attempt is to get a stamp of approval by distortion and falsehood from the Supreme Court and then use the stamp of approval to mislead the Parliament further when that is direct infringement of parliamentary privilege. We hope and trust that both Houses will take it up, take it up seriously,"" he said.

Singhvi said the Centre had misled the top court and a case of contempt of court and perjury is made out, besides a case of breach of privilege of Parliament.

Azad said there had been six JPCs -- from Bofors to many issues -- with four under the Congress rule and two formed during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, and asked why the same cannot be ordered on a ""scam"" of over Rs 41,000 crore.

""We have no faith in this government as it is misleading the Supreme Court by giving false information and is also misleading the people of the country,"" he alleged.

Azad said it was a reality that neither the CAG had given the report to the PAC, nor the PAC seen it and there was nothing in public domain.

""I am very sorry that there was no discussion on the privilege, but it is our demand that the chairman of Rajya Sabha and the Speaker of Lok Sabha should accept the privilege (notice) and, along with that, our demand of the JPC has also become even more necessary.

""The Supreme Court is supreme, but it has been misled by the government. What the government will tell the court, we do not know, but the JPC is the only way through which we can catch this theft,"" Azad said.

The Congress, through its notices, is demanding answers from the law minister on why the government provided wrong information to the Supreme Court about the CAG report on the Rafale-pricing issue, he said.

The party had on Sunday urged the apex court to recall its Rafale judgment and issue notices to the central government for contempt of court and perjury, alleging the Centre provided false information to the apex court.

The Supreme Court had on Friday dismissed pleas alleging irregularities in the Rafale deal, saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision-making process"" warranting setting aside of the defence contract for purchase of 36 fighter jets.

In its judgment, the court made a reference to a CAG report on the aircraft deal. It said the CAG report was examined by the Public Accounts Committee of the Parliament.

But, the Congress insisted that the government presented ""wrong facts"" before the court during the hearing of pleas challenging the aircraft deal with France.

On Saturday, the Centre moved the top court seeking correction in the judgment, saying ""misinterpretation"" of its note ""resulted in a controversy in the public domain"".

The Centre made it clear that it did not say the CAG report was examined by the PAC or a redacted portion was placed before Parliament. It clarified that the note had said the government ""has already shared"" the price details with CAG, written in past tense and ""is factually correct"".

The report also states, in detail, the significant role that National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval, had to play in the signing of the deal, although his name is nowhere mentioned in the list of people making up the Indian negotiating team, that was submitted to the court, in an affidavit by the centre, on 10 October.

In short, despite objections - ""the Indian government went ahead to sign the financial, security or legally enforceable guarantee for delivery from either the French government or the jets' manufacturer, Dassault Aviation,"" the report added.

Loopholes in the Inter-Governmental Draft Agreement: Officials

There were a series of loopholes in the inter-governmental draft agreement concerning the Rafale Deal, that was presented before India's Defence Acquisition Council, led by then Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, and was discussed between 28 August and 1 September, 2015, the report stated.

On Being Held Accountable:

For starters, Article 4 of the draft agreement stated that French government was to transfer its ""obligations"" (of seeing the deal through) onto Dassault under an agreement they were calling the ""convention"", which would perform the maneuver with MBDA, the missile supplier in the Rafale deal. As a result of which the French government could enter this ""convention"" with Dassault without making India a party to it.

This would mean that the Indian government would not be privy to any kind of information regarding its French counterpart's actions to ensure that the deal was seen through.

This is problematic, as it gives leeway to the French government to ""deny responsibility"", without leaving the Indian government an option to directly hold the former accountable, the report added.

On Resolving Disputes:

Another problem as per the draft agreement concerning the deal, would be on the issue of resolving disputes. According to the draft, these disputes were to be settled under the rules of international arbitration, with the seat of arbitration being, Geneva.

In the case of a breach of contract, India, as per the draft, would be pursuing legal action against the supplier companies, instead of the French government, hence in the likelihood of a breach, India would first have to ""exhaust all options for recovering the money from the supplier before bringing any claim to the French government,"" the report claimed.

India being isolated from the ""convention"" between the French government and Dassault; and not being able to pursue legal action in the case of a breach of contract, against the French government, gives it the leeway to not be held accountable in any Indian court of law, the report added.

Additionally, the draft also put unusual limits on the French government's liability, in the case of any damages concerning the deal, and no provisions for any kind of a sovereign guarantee, which requires a security deposit from a sovereign government on behalf of a third party, which can be forfeited in case of a default - two points which are standard provisions in the case of all defence agreements.

The Law Ministry's Objections to the Draft

When the draft was forwarded by the Defence Acquisition Council, to the Law Ministry for legal vetting, the latter came up with two separate responses: Note 228, that was dated 9 December, 2015 and Note 229, that was dated 11 December, the report stated.

While the earlier Note 228 claimed that the proposal for the ""convention"" would not entirely ""absolve the French government of its obligations towards India"", and approved most of the provisions mentioned in the draft, it did, however, oppose the lack of one for a sovereign guarantee. Note 229, was a step up from this, objected to the provisions which allowed the French government to transfer its obligations to the supplier companies, and advised that the ""Indian party should be a signatory or a confirming party with the Convention document"", the report stated.

If and only if the Indian government could not be made a party to the ""convention"", then it should insist on a ""joint and several liability"" clause in both the inter-government agreement and the ""convention."" Which only confirms that a third party will not influence the contract between the two main parties.

It also opposed the provision of putting a limit on French liability and called for a sovereign guarantee, the report added.

NSA Ajit Doval's Role in the Rafale Deal

After the law commission put forth these two responses, they were forwarded to the Indian negotiating team, by the Defence Acquisition Council. The negotiating team, at this point, was led by the deputy chief of air staff, Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria.

This is when the role of NSA Ajit Doval comes to the surface, the report claims. Citing Note 18, a retrospective document that was issued by the Defence Ministry in August of that year, the report claimed that:

""After the receipt of legal advice, discussions have taken place during the meetings of INT on these issues, in the meetings of MoD and also in the meeting of NSA and Member Secretary, INT, with the French side in Paris.""

The discussions took place on 12 and 13 January.

Despite the law commission's advice for India to be included in the ""convention"" and if not that, then only settle for a joint and several liability clause in the inter-government agreement, the latter is what the French government agreed to. As a result, India was naturally left out of the contents of the convention, the report added. There was also no agreement from the French side to the provision for a sovereign guarantee or on the limit of liability to the French government.

Following this, a ""joint document"" of the draft inter-governmental agreement. was signed between the Indian and French negotiating teams. Citing Note 12, that was issued by the Defence Ministry on 22 August, 2015, the report stated that the joint document was signed in NSA Doval's presence, which did not allow India a redress of the Law Ministry's concerns.

Following this, the Indian negotiators chose to not take the matter up again, and instead placed it before the Cabinet Committee on Security for deliberation - on the advise of NSA Doval, the report, citing Note 18 again, claimed. The report further stated its observation that this would mean both Doval and Swaraj asked Parrikar, who was Defence Minister, to not press for a sovereign guarantee.

Despite all of the objections to the draft agreement that had been raised by government bodies and officials - which all said that the Indian government was coming worse-off in the deal - the committee, with Modi at the head, approved it in its existing form on 24 August, 2015, the report stated.

""The lies of Congress and its party president Rahul Gandhi has been exposed. Rahul Gandhi should reveal his source of information. In the matter of national security, efforts have been made to malign the country internationally.

""Under whose inspiration, the Congress party had conspired to ensure that India does not get fighter jets? They should give answers to the people of this country,"" Irani said.

She alleged the Congress is trying to play with the national security and is spreading lies to mislead the people.

""The Congress has not only spread lies but has also tried to malign the Indian Air Force and the defence establishment. The Congress has tried to stand in the way of strengthening our forces,"" Irani said.

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed the pleas challenging the deal between India and France for procurement of 36 Rafale jets saying there was no occasion to ""really doubt the decision making process"" warranting setting aside of the contract.

The Congress has repeatedly criticised the deal for the 36 Rafale jets, alleging that the government was procuring each aircraft at a cost of over Rs 1,670 crore as against Rs 526 crore finalised by the UPA government.

The government has, however, denied any irregularity in the deal.

A day after the judgement, the government had on Saturday moved the Supreme Court seeking correction in the Rafale jet order where a reference has been made about the CAG report and the PAC, saying ""misinterpretation"" of its note has ""resulted in a controversy in the public domain"".

In the application, the Centre said it did not say that the CAG report was examined by PAC or a redacted portion was placed before Parliament. It clarified that the note had said the Government ""has already shared"" the price details with the CAG, which was written in past tense and ""is factually correct"".

When asked to react on Surjewala's demand, Irani said the government has placed before the Supreme Court the details of pricing, negotiations, offset policy and what would be the procedures if the CAG looks into it.

""The central government on behalf of the defence ministry has placed all the details before the Supreme court... I would like to ask Mr Surjewala that instead of spreading lies on this issue for last one year why didn't they move Supreme Court with those details.

""They didn't go to court as they are not interested in truth or nation building, they are only interested in defeating those who are involved in nation building,"" she alleged.

There was no substantial evidence of commercial favouritism to any private entity, the bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi had said on the issue of an offset partner in its ruling on a batch of petitions.

Accompanied by Chandigarh BJP president Sanjay Tandon, Singh said that the government had always maintained that it was ready to debate on all issues in Parliament, but the Congress did not allow it to happen.

""They have washed out every session. Outside the Parliament, they tell the media that government does not allow debate, but inside the House, they disturb the proceedings. They don't have courage and conviction to engage in a debate,"" Singh claimed.

Lashing out at the Gandhi family for alleging corruption in the defence contract, she said ""amazing audacity"" was shown by them ""in not listening"" to the Supreme Court's verdict in the Rafale deal case.

""The Congress is knowingly misleading people on the pricing of the Rafale jets,"" Sitharaman told reporters at the BJP office in Mumbai.

""The stance of the country's 'first family' in not listening to the apex court's order on the Rafale deal case petition can be termed as, with due respect, amazing audacity,"" the minister said.

She was speaking as part of the BJP's move to hold pressers in 70 cities across the country on Monday to attack the opposition party against the backdrop of the Supreme Court's verdict on the controversial Rafale jet deal.

Sitharaman said, ""We've given the price to the CAG, in a parliamentary system the CAG looks into it and then its report goes to PAC. The PAC will have a look at it and then it'll become a public document. It is a process and it has commenced.""

""In the affidavit we've given the data and the information. We think there's an interpretation problem, we would like you (court) to look at it and correct it. That's our appeal to the court, we'll wait for them to take the call,"" she said.

The minister further said they have explained the process through which information comes to Parliament.

""In that the past tense, future tense, present tense and present continuous tense has come into play. That is post the decision, is it not? Therefore, how is it going to affect the verdict?"" she said.

The Supreme Court on Friday had said there is no occasion to doubt the decision-making process in the procurement of 36 Rafale jets from France, and dismissed all the petitions seeking an investigation into alleged irregularities in the Rs 58,000 crore deal.

Gandhi had also reiterated the Congress' demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) probe into the fighter jet deal and claimed that if it was conducted, names of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and businessman Anil Ambani will come to the fore.

He said the apex court in its verdict cited that a report by the CAG on the Rafale deal was submitted to the PAC but asserted that no such report was given to the House panel headed by Congress' leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge.

But as evidence emerged of direct Saudi involvement in Khashoggi's murder on October 2, Canada in late November announced sanctions against 17 Saudi nationals linked to killing.

""The murder of a journalist is absolutely unacceptable and that's why Canada from the very beginning had been demanding answers and solutions on that,"" Trudeau said Sunday in an interview with CTV.

""We inherited actually a (Can) dollars 15 billion contract signed by (former prime minister) Stephen Harper to export light-armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia,"" he said.

""We are engaged with the export permits to try and see if there is a way of no longer exporting these vehicles to Saudi Arabia,"" he added.

The penalty for breaking the contract could exceed Canadian dollar 1 billion, Trudeau said in an interview with CBC Radio in October.

Trudeau has been criticised by political opponents and Human Rights activists for failing to cancel the contract.

London, Ontario-based manufacturer General Dynamic Land Systems Canada inked the deal in 2014 to supply 928 LAV 6 armoured personnel carriers to Saudi Arabia.

The deal, worth USD 11.5 billion, was the largest arms deal in Canadian history.

But the contract was scaled back earlier this year, amid protests, to 742, dropping heavy assault versions equipped with cannons that activists and opposition politicians warned could be used against civilians and to help Riyadh wage war in Yemen.

Khashoggi, a US resident who wrote for The Washington Post and had been a critic of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, killed and dismembered, according to Turkish officials.

After lengthy denials, Saudi authorities admitted responsibility for the murder and said 21 people had been taken into custody.

However, a CIA analysis leaked to the US media went further, pointing the finger at the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.

In October, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said her country would suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia over the murder.

Relations between Canada and the Saudi kingdom have been in crisis in recent months.

A miserable, last-place team in 2007, the Rays surged all the way to the World Series the next season, riding Longoria's terrific rookie campaign to glory. Rays management knew what they had from the get-go, working out a handshake deal with Longoria while he was still in the minors that you never saw in baseball: a nine-year contract for a player who hadn't yet made his major league debut. Longoria officially signed the contract six days into his major league career, launching a decade of dominance: three All-Star appearances, three Gold Gloves, 261 home runs, and a spot in the driver's seat for the most successful stretch in franchise history, which saw Tampa Bay make the postseason four times in six years. 2018 Result: 90-72, third place in AL EastKey free agents: Carlos Gomez, Sergio RomoNeeds: Starting pitching, relief pitching, DHSo when the Rays traded Longoria to the Giants on Dec. 20 of last year, the fan base was thrown for a loop. Tampa Bay was already coming off a sub-.500 season, turning into one of the dreariest teams in the league and a far cry from their glory days of 2008-2013. Without Longoria, who would be left to root for? What would become of Rays baseball?That much-panned trade now looks like one of the savviest moves the team has ever made. Already declining at the time the Rays traded him, Longoria slipped to a miserable .244/.281/.413 in 2018. Now 33 years old, he's owed $72.5 million over the next four years, meaning the Rays cleaned up even if the three prospects they acquired for him don't work out. For the single-most budget-conscious team in the game, keeping Longoria's contract would have been a crushing albatross. Instead, the Rays are better set up than at any point since that six-year peak. They're coming off a 90-win season and four of their projected five rotation members are 27 or younger. Moreover, the Rays carry the cleanest balance sheet in the American League, with only two players signed through 2020, and just one signed beyond that. Let's start with that 90-win shocker. Left-hander Blake Snell replaced Longoria as the face of the franchise, going 21-5 with a 1.89 ERA and 221 strikeouts, taking home a Cy Young award no one saw coming. What's particularly ironic is that Snell aside, no team deemphasized starting pitching more than the Rays did last year. Manager Kevin Cash and the team's always innovative front office fired an aggressive ""opener"" strategy at the rest of the league, with strong results. Rather than search in vain for five starters who could approach 1,000 combined innings, the Rays rode Snell but otherwise had no traditional starter make more than 17 starts. Instead, they used short relievers to pitch an inning or two to start games, then pulled out the early hook. The goal was to flummox opponents by flipping from righties to lefties, flyball pitchers to groundball ones, forcing opposing managers into uncomfortable early game decisions. And it worked. Would-be staff ace Chris Archer struggled through a third straight season with an ERA over 4.00, injuries and attrition kneecapped the rest of the rotation (other than Snell), and yet the Rays rolled to their best record (and their first above-.500 season) in five years. Tampa Bay complemented their eye-opening pitching results with the sixth-best offense in the majors (park-adjusted). Multiple protagonists lifted the offense, including breakout infielders Willy Adames and Joey Wendle, and outfielder Tommy Pham, who caught fire after coming over in a midseason trade with the Cardinals. Additional upside permeates this young roster too, with promising young outfielder Austin Meadows and strikeout-heaving right-hander Tyler Glasnow two of the better breakout candidates in the league after coming over in a deal with the Pirates last summer for Archer.Emboldened by that 90-win campaign and freed by their financial maneuvering, the Rays are now attacking hot stove season more aggressively than they have in years. Last week brought the two-year, $30 million signing of Charlie Morton, the late-blooming right-hander who dominated at times for the Astros and will now be counted on for quality innings in his mid-30s. One of the deepest collections of free-agent relievers ever will allow the Rays to wait out the market and hopefully still land a big arm or two for the pen.Up next could be a trade for a big bat. The Rays engineered a three-team trade with Seattle and Cleveland last week, and rumors have a potential continuation of that trade sending slugger Edwin Encarnacion to Tampa Bay. The Rays reportedly considered dangling top outfield prospect Jesus Sanchez in a trade for All-Star first baseman Paul Goldschmidt before Goldschmidt landed with the Cardinals. And they're now one of six teams said to be in trade talks with the Marlins for J.T. Realmuto, who's emerged as the best all-around catcher in the majors. Even if Tampa Bay had literally zero dollars committed to anybody, it would still be out of the bidding for turbocharged free agents like Bryce Harper and Manny Machado. But if they can pull the trigger to acquire a legitimate star like Realmuto, that would be a whole new look for the Rays. With the big, bad Yankees and Red Sox looking as big and bad as ever, money-saving trades and clever bullpen usage will only get you so far.

The aim of the Catalyst Series is to guide technologists in understanding, experimenting with, and developing cutting-edge public blockchain protocols. In India, less than 1% of the country's developers have exposure to blockchain development, and experience is limited to platforms such as Hyperledger and Ethereum. Catalyst aims to bring India to the global blockchain frontier through community participation and developer education.

This series is a first-of-its-kind EOS workshop and hackathon, kicking off with a three-weekend-long curriculum covering the EOS protocol architectural design, developer tooling/environments, and smart contract and dApp (decentralized application) development. Hundreds of applicants sought the opportunity to attend the workshops, which featured sessions by international blockchain experts across Ukraine, China, Korea and the United States.

The workshop concluded with India's first EOS Hackathon on November 24, 2018. Teams were tasked with building an EOS dApp within one day for a prize of INR 70,000. Numerous innovative ideas and use-cases emerged from the hackathon, such as utilizing blockchain to streamline and audit government benefit schemes, decentralized predictive markets and augmented reality-based gaming platforms with tokenized virtual goods.

Dunya Labs launched and conducted this event in partnership with pioneers from the blockchain industry including local leaders Incrypt and Koinex, as well as international EOS block producers EOS Canon, EOSYS, CryptoLions, Attic Lab, AlohaEOS, EOS Nation and Meet.One.

""The Catalyst Series is the first blockchain programme in India focused on the frontier protocols which are emerging in the space. Our goal is to give the Indian developer community a taste of cutting-edge innovations in decentralized technologies, and equip them with the knowledge and skills to build on the decentralized Internet of the future,"" said Cathy Guo, Co-Founder and CEO, Dunya Labs.

""Through our collaboration with Government of Telangana, we aim to provide more collective opportunities for developers to build decentralized blockchain applications, in turn propelling India towards leadership in the global blockchain industry,"" added Srikar Varadaraj, Co-Founder and Chief Research Officer, Dunya Labs. ""We praise the forward-looking stance and initiatives taken by the IT Minister and IT department for blockchain and its potential in the state.""

""I was amazed by the vibrancy and infectious energy of all participants. It was incredible to see so many technology enthusiasts choosing to spend their weekends with us. One of my favourite aspects of hosting these workshops was interacting with each participant - from blockchain newcomers to dedicated believers. There's already strong demand for teams to continue working together on building dApp ideas. We plan on expanding these workshops in 2019 to cover more world-class protocol projects, and are excited to bring more hands-on building opportunities to India,"" said Grace Guo, Head of Business Development, Dunya Labs.

Investors, meanwhile, appeared to take little solace in strong U.S. retail sales data.

The Dow fell 496.87 points, or 2%, to end at 24,100.51. The S&P 500 index shed 50.59 points, or 1.9%, to close at 2,599.95. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 58.59 points, or 0.8%, to finish at 6,910.66.

Fresh evidence that global trade tensions are hitting the world's second-biggest economy emerged on Friday, as China released data that showed both industrial output and retail sales for November missed economists' forecasts. China's National Bureau of Statistics attempted to cool concerns, saying the economy performed within the reasonable range. Economic data out of Europe was no more encouraging, after IHS Markit's purchasing manager's index, released Friday, showed the German and French private sectors slowing sharply in November.

Johnson & Johnson was the Dow's biggest loser Friday, with shares tumbling 10%, after a report alleged the company knew for decades that its baby talcum powder was sometimes contaminated with the carcinogen asbestos. Shares of Costco fell 8.6%, after a Thursday evening earnings release showed the retailer missed revenue expectations for the fiscal first quarter.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.4%. A stronger U.S. unit is seen as a headwind for commodities priced in dollars as it makes them more expensive to users of other currencies.

U.S. data released Friday was solid, with November retail sales showing the holiday season got off to a strong start. Industrial production was up 0.6% in November, posting the strongest gain in three months. The flash reading of the U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index, however, fell to a 13-month low of 53.9 in December.

The softer data was blamed for a weak tone across global equity markets, with U.S. benchmark stock indexes moving broadly lower on Wall Street. The dollar, meanwhile, was seen as a beneficiary, rising solidly versus most major rivals.

China's business activity mostly slowed in November, with industrial output showing a weaker-than-expected year-over-year rise of 5.4% in November after a 5.9% rise in October. Retail sales rose 8.1% year-over-year versus 8.6% in October, also coming in below expectations.

Bullion prices ended lower at Comex on Friday, 14 December 2018. A round of weaker-than-expected Chinese economic data spooked global investors on Friday, but failed to provide a lift for gold thanks to a stronger U.S. dollar.

Gold for February delivery on Comex lost $6, or 0.5%, to settle at $1,241.40 an ounce, the lowest finish since 3 December 2018. It ended down 0.9% for the week. March silver fell 21.8 cents, or 1.5%, to $14.637 an ounce, with prices settling around 0.4% lower on the week.

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index, a measure of the U.S. currency against a basket of six major rivals, rose 0.4%. A stronger U.S. unit is seen as a headwind for commodities priced in dollars as it makes them more expensive to users of other currencies.

Oil prices fell on Friday, 14 December 2018 settling lower for the week, as a stronger dollar cut global demand for U.S.-priced commodities and a slide for the stock market sullied the risk-taking mood. Meanwhile, natural-gas futures took a plunge that left them down nearly 15% for the week the largest such loss in nearly three years, as weather forecasts dulled prospects for demand.

Oil prices had climbed on Thursday as traders contemplated data showing a blip higher in monthly OPEC output even as future cuts loom, as well as a recent report of a weekly decline in U.S. crude supplies and production. Gains picked up late Thursday after a news report said Saudi Arabia plans to cut shipments to U.S. refiners to avoid an expansion of U.S. stockpiles.

On Friday, West Texas Intermediate crude for January delivery fell $1.38, or 2.6%, to settle at $51.20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract was down 2.7% for the week. Global benchmark February Brent crude fell $1.17, or 1.9%, to $60.28 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe, down about 2.3% for the week.

Investors sought safety in U.S. Treasuries, pushing yields lower across the curve. The 2-yr yield lost three basis points to 2.73%, and the 10-yr yield lost two basis points to 2.89%. Also, the U.S. Dollar Index rose 0.4% to 97.45, nearing a yearly high.

Looking ahead, investors will receive the NAHB Housing Market Index for December, the Empire State Manufacturing Survey for December, and Net Long-Term TIC Flows for October on Monday.

The operations of Monorail are currently in the hands of MMRDA. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority sacked the appointed operators last week for failing to perform well and has taken charge of the affairs, promising to repair non-functional rakes and buy new ones from the international market.

Last Friday, the authority issued a termination notice to the operation and maintenance contractor, Larsen & Toubro and Scomi Engineering (LTSE), citing its failure to fulfil contractual obligations. The process for appointing a new operator is yet to begin.

Currently, only the first phase between Chembur and Wadala is operational. The MMRDA on Friday blamed LTSE for not fulfilling the promise of 15 trains that has delayed the commissioning of second phase of Monorail between Wadala and Jacob Circle. On Saturday, it also said it was contemplating blacklisting Scomi Engineering over failing to deliver as per the agreement.

DNA sounds out citizens on what they think the MMRDA should do to pull the Monorail out of its current mess.

It's good MMRDA realised that LTSE spoiled their project and wasted time and money of Mumbaikar. At last there is some realisation in favour of public interest. The breach of deadlines has become an unending saga for Monorail. MMRDA, rather than issuing tenders, should find an immediate alternative for procurement of new rakes and spare parts so the full phase is open for operation. -- Monish Makhija, Chembur resident

The revival of Monorail depends upon its frequency and connectivity. MMRDA should immediately start services up to Jacob Circle. Commuters will only use Monorail if they get better connectivity. Currently, there is no direct connectivity from Lower Parel. In addition, there were incidents like fire that need to be avoided in future. There is also the need to increase train frequency. -- Santosh Bali, Sion

The MMRDA, besides ensuring that the Monorail runs smoothly, has to come up with a proper plan to execute entire project. What I feel is that the route they have selected itself is wrong. If you compare its route to Versova-Ghatkopar Metro Rail route, there are not as many passengers. Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority should expand and connect it in a way that people can use it more. Common people will use when they benefit by using it. Versova-Ghatkopar Metro routes is seeing an increase in passengers and it is also getting revenues which is important for the route to function -- Ravi Nair, Marol

I don't believe that MMRDA has the capability to run Monorail. They have failed to implement the project in a proper way. It was supposed to be a mass transit system but it has, instead, turned into a joyride for the people. Projects like Monorail are a result of inefficient decisions taken by authorities like the MMRDA. In fact, the entire idea of having a monorail is a flawed one -- Rajendra Pradhan, Chembur

After the shutdown of Monorail, the biggest fear that people have is whether it is structurally fit. The authorities should ensure that before they introduce more rakes, they should thoroughly check the line and rakes so that there is no repetition of any untoward incident like the last time -- Madhu Kotian, Mulund

As only this one phase of the line 1 Monorail is operational, the second phase till Jacob Circle should be made operational immediately. MMRDA should also tie up with BEST so that feeder routes from congested localities can be introduced. Monorail needs to be extended from the Chembur-end to a locality like Powai -- running through Tilak Nagar, Vidya Vihar, Vikhroli. This will cater to the areas that are not well-connected. Similarly, on the other end, the Monorail needs to be extended from Jacob Circle to Mandvi, running through Byculla, JJ Hospital, Umarkhadi, Dana Bundar and Carnac Bundar. -- Godfrey Pimenta, Andheri

Now that MMRDA has taken over the Monorail's operations, it should ensure that servicesdo not stop and adequate maintenance is done. Also, the ticket prices should be made reasonable for the citizens, considering its ticket prices are proposed to be hiked from Rs 5 and Rs 11 to Rs 10 and Rs 40. -- Suhail Ansari, Pydhonie

Monorail was at best just a technology demonstrator. No one uses the service because of its poorly thought of routes. It was a major waste of public money. Mostly, just school students, and staff from Bharat and Hindustan Petroleum refineries between Chembur to Mahul or others moving on those routes can be encouraged to use the Monorail instead of buses. -- Jagdeep Desai, Andheri resident

MMRDA should set up a dedicated team to start the second phase within the next 4-6 months. This team should be headed by an experienced person (someone who has retired from Railways or MRVC). This team should have extensive interaction with all stakeholders which should include a proper public consultation to get feedback on deficiencies in earlier operations. It seems MMRDA has done some spadework before terminating contract with L&T-Scomi. It is on right track. -- AV Shenoy, member of Mumbai Vikas Samiti

Now that MMRDA is going to run Monorail, it should understand that well-trained personnel, spares, rakes and funds are needed for proper operation. It has to ensure that they get spares for repairing non-functional trains, and also has to ensure that there are no legal issues in getting these spares from the suppliers that were supplying the same to Scomi Engineering. It should also bring back the people who left LTSE, back in the role to the extent possible. Lastly, it should also have at least one technically capable person in their team to understand Monorail better. -- SP Khade, Former Technical Director (Monorail), MMRDA"
"441","1020007144","2018-12-16","https://www.deccanherald.com/international/jj-knew-decades-asbestos-708326.html","J&J knew for decades about asbestos in talcs","Deccan Herald",FALSE,"Darlene Coker knew she was dying. She just wanted to know why.

She knew that her cancer, mesothelioma, arose in the delicate membrane surrounding her lungs and other organs. She knew it was as rare as it was deadly, a signature of exposure to asbestos. And she knew it afflicted mostly men who inhaled asbestos dust in mines and industries such as shipbuilding that used the carcinogen before its risks were understood.

Coker, 52 years old, had raised two daughters and was running a massage school in Lumberton, a small town in eastern Texas. How had she been exposed to asbestos? ""She wanted answers,"" her daughter Cady Evans said.

Fighting for every breath and in crippling pain, Coker hired Herschel Hobson, a personal-injury lawyer. He homed in on a suspect: the Johnson's Baby Powder that Coker had used on her infant children and sprinkled on herself all her life. Hobson knew that talc and asbestos often occurred together in the earth, and that mined talc could be contaminated with the carcinogen. Coker sued Johnson & Johnson, alleging that ""poisonous talc"" in the company's beloved product was her killer.

J&J denied the claim. Baby Powder was asbestos-free, it said. As the case proceeded, J&J was able to avoid handing over talc test results and other internal company records Hobson had requested to make the case against Baby Powder.

Coker had no choice but to drop her lawsuit, Hobson said. ""When you are the plaintiff, you have the burden of proof,"" he said. ""We didn't have it.""

That was in 1999. Two decades later, the material Coker and her lawyer sought is emerging as J&J has been compelled to share thousands of pages of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents with lawyers for some of the 11,700 plaintiffs now claiming that the company's talc caused their cancers -- including thousands of women with ovarian cancer.

A Reuters examination of many of those documents, as well as deposition and trial testimony, shows that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, and that company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.

The documents also depict successful efforts to influence U.S. regulators' plans to limit asbestos in cosmetic talc products and scientific research on the health effects of talc.

A small portion of the documents have been produced at trial and cited in media reports. Many were shielded from public view by court orders that allowed J&J to turn over thousands of documents it designated as confidential. Much of their contents is reported here for the first time.

""RATHER HIGH""

The earliest mentions of tainted J&J talc that Reuters found come from 1957 and 1958 reports by a consulting lab. They describe contaminants in talc from J&J's Italian supplier as fibrous and ""acicular,"" or needle-like, tremolite. That's one of the six minerals that in their naturally occurring fibrous form are classified as asbestos.

At various times from then into the early 2000s, reports by scientists at J&J, outside labs and J&J's supplier yielded similar findings. The reports identify contaminants in talc and finished powder products as asbestos or describe them in terms typically applied to asbestos, such as ""fiberform"" and ""rods.""

In 1976, as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was weighing limits on asbestos in cosmetic talc products, J&J assured the regulator that no asbestos was ""detected in any sample"" of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973. It didn't tell the agency that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc - in one case at levels reported as ""rather high.""

Most internal J&J asbestos test reports Reuters reviewed do not find asbestos. However, while J&J's testing methods improved over time, they have always had limitations that allow trace contaminants to go undetected - and only a tiny fraction of the company's talc is tested.

The World Health Organization and other authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos. While most people exposed never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts of asbestos are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn't been established. Many plaintiffs allege that the amounts they inhaled when they dusted themselves with tainted talcum powder were enough.

The evidence of what J&J knew has surfaced after people who suspected that talc caused their cancers hired lawyers experienced in the decades-long deluge of litigation involving workers exposed to asbestos. Some of the lawyers knew from those earlier cases that talc producers tested for asbestos, and they began demanding J&J's testing documentation.

What J&J produced in response to those demands has allowed plaintiffs' lawyers to refine their argument: The culprit wasn't necessarily talc itself, but also asbestos in the talc. That assertion, backed by decades of solid science showing that asbestos causes mesothelioma and is associated with ovarian and other cancers, has had mixed success in court.

In two cases earlier this year - in New Jersey and California - juries awarded big sums to plaintiffs who, like Coker, blamed asbestos-tainted J&J talc products for their mesothelioma.

A third verdict, in St. Louis, was a watershed, broadening J&J's potential liability: The 22 plaintiffs were the first to succeed with a claim that asbestos-tainted Baby Powder and Shower to Shower talc, a longtime brand the company sold in 2012, caused ovarian cancer, which is much more common than mesothelioma. The jury awarded them $4.69 billion in damages. Most of the talc cases have been brought by women with ovarian cancer who say they regularly used J&J talc products as a perineal antiperspirant and deodorant.

At the same time, at least three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs' mesothelioma. Others have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.

""JUNK"" SCIENCE

J&J has said it will appeal the recent verdicts against it. It has maintained in public statements that its talc is safe, as shown for years by the best tests available, and that the information it has been required to divulge in recent litigation shows the care the company takes to ensure its products are asbestos-free. It has blamed its losses on juror confusion, ""junk"" science, unfair court rules and overzealous lawyers looking for a fresh pool of asbestos plaintiffs.

""Plaintiffs' attorneys out for personal financial gain are distorting historical documents and intentionally creating confusion in the courtroom and in the media,"" Ernie Knewitz, J&J's vice president of global media relations, wrote in an emailed response to Reuters' findings. ""This is all a calculated attempt to distract from the fact that thousands of independent tests prove our talc does not contain asbestos or cause cancer. Any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.""

J&J declined to comment further for this article. For more than two months, it turned down repeated requests for an interview with J&J executives. On Dec. 8, the company offered to make an expert available. It had not done so as of Thursday evening.

The company referred all inquiries to its outside litigation counsel, Peter Bicks. In emailed responses, Bicks rejected Reuters' findings as ""false and misleading."" ""The scientific consensus is that the talc used in talc-based body powders does not cause cancer, regardless of what is in that talc,"" Bicks wrote. ""This is true even if - and it does not - Johnson & Johnson's cosmetic talc had ever contained minute, undetectable amounts of asbestos."" He dismissed tests cited in this article as ""outlier"" results.

In court, J&J lawyers have told jurors that company records showing that asbestos was detected in its talc referred to talc intended for industrial use. Other records, they have argued, referred to non-asbestos forms of the same minerals that their experts say are harmless. J&J has also argued that some tests picked up ""background"" asbestos - stray fibers that could have contaminated samples after floating into a mill or lab from a vehicle clutch or fraying insulation.

The company has made some of the same arguments about lab tests conducted by experts hired by plaintiffs. One of those labs found asbestos in Shower to Shower talc from the 1990s, according to an Aug. 11, 2017, court report. Another lab found asbestos in more than half of multiple samples of Baby Powder from past decades - in bottles from plaintiffs' cupboards and acquired from eBay, and even a 1978 bottle held in J&J's corporate museum. The concentrations were great enough that users ""would have, more likely than not, been exposed,"" the plaintiffs' lab report presented in several cases this year concluded.

Matthew Sanchez, a geologist with consultants RJ Lee Group Inc and a frequent expert witness for J&J, dismissed those findings in testimony in the St. Louis trial: ""I have not found asbestos in any of the current or modern, what I consider modern, Johnson & Johnson talc products,"" Sanchez told the jury. Sanchez did not return calls seeking comment. RJ Lee said it does not comment on the work it does for clients.

Since 2003, talc in Baby Powder sold in the United States has come from China through supplier Imerys Talc America, a unit of Paris-based Imerys SA and a co-defendant in most of the talc litigation. Imerys and J&J said the Chinese talc is safe. An Imerys spokesman said the company's tests ""consistently show no asbestos. Talc's safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies.""

J&J, based in New Brunswick, New Jersey, has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, its sales outpacing those of all competitors combined, according to Euromonitor International data. And while talc products contributed just $420 million to J&J's $76.5 billion in revenue last year, Baby Powder is considered an essential facet of the healthcare-products maker's carefully tended image as a caring company - a ""sacred cow,"" as one 2003 internal email put it.

""When people really understand what's going on, I think it increases J&J's exposure a thousand-fold,"" said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers for the women in the St. Louis case.

The mounting controversy surrounding J&J talc hasn't shaken investors. The share price is up about 6 percent so far this year. Talc cases make up fewer than 10 percent of all personal injury lawsuits pending against J&J, based on the company's Aug. 2 quarterly report, in which the company said it believed it had ""strong grounds on appeal.""

J&J Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky has pledged to fight on, telling analysts in July: ""We remain confident that our products do not contain asbestos.""

Gorsky's comment, echoed in countless J&J statements, misses a crucial point. Asbestos, like many environmental carcinogens, has a long latency period. Diagnosis usually comes years after initial exposure - 20 years or longer for mesothelioma. J&J talc products today may be safe, but the talc at issue in thousands of lawsuits was sold and used over the past 60 years.

""SAFETY FIRST""

In 1886, Robert Wood Johnson enlisted his younger brothers in an eponymous startup built around the ""Safety First"" motto. Johnson's Baby Powder grew out of a line of medicated plasters, sticky rubber strips loaded with mustard and other home remedies. When customers complained of skin irritation, the brothers sent packets of talc.

Soon, mothers began applying the talc to infants' diaper-chafed skin. The Johnsons took note. They added a fragrance that would become one of the most recognizable in the world, sifted the talc into tin boxes and, in 1893, began selling it as Johnson's Baby Powder.

In the late 1950s, J&J discovered that talc from its chief source mine for the U.S. market in the Italian Alps contained tremolite. That's one of six minerals - along with chrysotile, actinolite, amosite, anthophyllite and crocidolite - that occur in nature as crystalline fibers known as asbestos, a recognized carcinogen. Some of them, including tremolite, also occur as unremarkable ""non-asbestiform"" rocks. Both forms often occur together and in talc deposits.

J&J's worry at the time was that contaminants made the company's powder abrasive. It sent tons of its Italian talc to a private lab in Columbus, Ohio, to find ways to improve the appearance, feel and purity of the powder by removing as much ""grit"" as possible. In a pair of reports from 1957 and 1958, the lab said the talc contained ""from less than 1 percent to about 3 percent of contaminants,"" described as mostly fibrous and ""acicular"" tremolite.

Most of the authors of these and other J&J records cited in this article are dead. Sanchez, the RJ Lee geologist whose firm has agreed to provide him as a witness in up to 100 J&J talc trials, has testified that tremolite found decades ago in the company's talc, from Italy and later Vermont, was not tremolite asbestos at all. Rather, he has said, it was ""cleavage fragments"" from non-asbestiform tremolite.

J&J's original records don't always make that distinction. In terms of health risk, regulators since the early 1970s have treated small fiber-shaped particles of both forms the same.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, for example, ""makes no distinction between fibers and (comparable) cleavage fragments,"" agency officials wrote in a response to an RJ Lee report on an unrelated matter in 2006, the year before the firm hired Sanchez. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), though it dropped the non-fibrous forms of the minerals from its definition of asbestos in 1992, nonetheless recommends that fiber-shaped fragments indistinguishable from asbestos be counted in its exposure tests.

And as the product safety director for J&J's talc supplier acknowledged in a 2008 email to colleagues: ""(I)f a deposit contains 'non-asbestiform' tremolite, there is also asbestiform tremolite naturally present as well.""

""THE LUNGS OF BABIES""

In 1964, J&J's Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary bought a cluster of talc mines in Vermont, with names like Argonaut, Rainbow, Frostbite and Black Bear. By 1966, it was blasting and bulldozing white rock out of the Green Mountain state. J&J used the milled powder in its cosmetic powders and sold a less-refined grade to roofing, flooring and tire companies for use in manufacturing.

Ten years after tremolite turned up in the Italian talc, it showed up in Vermont talc, too. In 1967, J&J found traces of tremolite and another mineral that can occur as asbestos, according to a table attached to a Nov. 1, 1967, memo by William Ashton, the executive in charge of J&J's talc supply for decades.

J&J continued to search for sources of clean talc. But in an April 9, 1969, memo to a company doctor, Ashton said it was ""normal"" to find tremolite in many U.S. talc deposits. He suggested J&J rethink its approach. ""Historically, in our Company, Tremolite has been bad,"" Ashton wrote. ""How bad is Tremolite medically, and how much of it can safely be in a talc base we might develop?""

Since pulmonary disease, including cancer, appeared to be on the rise, ""it would seem to be prudent to limit any possible content of Tremolite ... to an absolute minimum,"" came the reply from another physician executive days later.

The doctor told Ashton that J&J was receiving safety questions from pediatricians. Even Robert Wood Johnson II, the founder's son and then-retired CEO, had expressed ""concern over the possibility of the adverse effects on the lungs of babies or mothers,"" he wrote.

""We have replied,"" the doctor wrote, that ""we would not regard the usage of our powders as presenting any hazard."" Such assurances would be impossible, he added, ""if we do include Tremolite in more than unavoidable trace amounts.""

The memo is the earliest J&J document reviewed by Reuters that discusses tremolite as more than a scratchy nuisance. The doctor urged Ashton to consult with company lawyers because ""it is not inconceivable that we could become involved in litigation.""

NEVER ""100% CLEAN""

By the early 1970s, asbestos was widely recognized as the primary cause of mesothelioma among workers involved in producing it and in industries that used it in their products.

Regulation was in the air. In 1972, President Richard Nixon's newly created OSHA issued its first rule, setting limits on workplace exposure to asbestos dust.

By then, a team at Mount Sinai Medical Center led by pre-eminent asbestos researcher Irving Selikoff had started looking at talcum powders as a possible solution to a puzzle: Why were tests of lung tissue taken post mortem from New Yorkers who never worked with asbestos finding signs of the mineral? Since talc deposits are often laced with asbestos, the scientists reasoned, perhaps talcum powders played a role.

They shared their preliminary findings with New York City's environmental protection chief, Jerome Kretchmer. On June 29, 1971, Kretchmer informed the Nixon administration and called a press conference to announce that two unidentified brands of cosmetic talc appeared to contain asbestos.

The FDA opened an inquiry. J&J issued a statement: ""Our fifty years of research knowledge in this area indicates that there is no asbestos contained in the powder manufactured by Johnson & Johnson.""

Later that year, another Mount Sinai researcher, mineralogist Arthur Langer, told J&J in a letter that the team had found a ""relatively small"" amount of chrysotile asbestos in Baby Powder.

Langer, Selikoff and Kretchmer ended up on a J&J list of ""antagonistic personalities"" in a Nov. 29, 1972, memo, which described Selikoff as the leader of an ""attack on talc.""

""I suppose I was antagonistic,"" Langer told Reuters. Even so, in a subsequent test of J&J powders in 1976, he didn't find asbestos - a result that Mount Sinai announced.

Langer said he told J&J lawyers who visited him last year that he stood by all of his findings. J&J has not called him as a witness.

Selikoff died in 1992. Kretchmer said he recently read that a jury had concluded that Baby Powder was contaminated with asbestos. ""I said to myself, 'How come it took so long?' "" he said.

In July 1971, meanwhile, J&J sent a delegation of scientists to Washington to talk to the FDA officials looking into asbestos in talcum powders. According to an FDA account of the meeting, J&J shared ""evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.""

Later that month, Wilson Nashed, one of the J&J scientists who visited the FDA, said in a memo to the company's public relations department that J&J's talc contained trace amounts of ""fibrous minerals (tremolite/actinolite).""

""INCONTROVERTIBLE ASBESTOS""

As the FDA continued to investigate asbestos in talc, J&J sent powder samples to be tested at private and university labs. Though a private lab in Chicago found trace amounts of tremolite, it declared the amount ""insignificant"" and the samples ""substantially free of asbestiform material."" J&J reported that finding to the FDA under a cover letter that said the ""results clearly show"" the samples tested ""contain no chrysotile asbestos."" J&J's lawyer told Reuters the tremolite found in the samples was not asbestos.

But J&J's FDA submission left out University of Minnesota professor Thomas E. Hutchinson's finding of chrysotile in a Shower to Shower sample - ""incontrovertible asbestos,"" as he described it in a lab note.

The FDA's own examinations found no asbestos in J&J powder samples in the 1f970s. Those tests, however, did not use the most sensitive detection methods. An early test, for example, was incapable of detecting chrysotile fibers, as an FDA official recognized in a J&J account of an Aug. 11, 1972, meeting with the agency: ""I understand that some samples will be passed even though they contain such fibers, but we are willing to live with it.""

By 1973, Tom Shelley, director of J&J's Central Research Laboratories in New Jersey, was looking into acquiring patents on a process that a British mineralogist and J&J consultant was developing to separate talc from tremolite.

""It is quite possible that eventually tremolite will be prohibited in all talc,"" Shelley wrote on Feb. 20, 1973, to a British colleague. Therefore, he added, the ""process may well be valuable property to us.""

At the end of March, Shelley recognized the sensitivity of the plan in a memo sent to a J&J lawyer in New Jersey: ""We will want to carefully consider the ... patents re asbestos in talc. It's quite possible that we may wish to keep the whole thing confidential rather than allow it to be published in patent form and thus let the whole world know.""

J&J did not obtain the patents.

While Shelley was looking into the patents, J&J research director DeWitt Petterson visited the company's Vermont mining operation. ""Occasionally, sub-trace quantities of tremolite or actinolite are identifiable,"" he wrote in an April 1973 report on the visit. ""And these might be classified as asbestos fiber.""

J&J should ""protect our powder franchise"" by eliminating as many tiny fibers that can be inhaled in airborn talc dust as possible, Petterson wrote. He warned, however, that ""no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles."" Introducing a cornstarch version of Baby Powder, he noted, ""is obviously another answer.""

Bicks told Reuters that J&J believes that the tremolite and actinolite Petterson cited were not asbestos.

Cornstarch came up again in a March 5, 1974, report in which Ashton, the J&J talc supply chief, recommended that the company research that alternative ""for defensive reasons"" because ""the thrust against talc has centered primarily on biological problems alleged to result from the inhalation of talc and related mineral particles.""

""WE MAY HAVE PROBLEMS""

A few months after Petterson's recognition that talc purity was a pipe dream, the FDA proposed a rule that talc used in drugs contain no more than 0.1 percent asbestos. While the agency's cosmetics division was considering similar action on talcum powders, it asked companies to suggest testing methods.

At the time, J&J's Baby Powder franchise was consuming 20,000 tons of Vermont talc a year. J&J pressed the FDA to approve an X-ray scanning technique that a company scientist said in an April 1973 memo allowed for ""an automatic 1% tolerance for asbestos."" That would mean talc with up to 10 times the FDA's proposed limit for asbestos in drugs could pass muster.

The same scientist confided in an Oct. 23, 1973, note to a colleague that, depending on what test the FDA adopted for detecting asbestos in cosmetic talc, ""we may have problems.""

The best way to detect asbestos in talc was to concentrate the sample and then examine it through microscopes, the Colorado School of Mines Research Institute told J&J in a Dec. 27, 1973, report. In a memo, a J&J lab supervisor said the concentration technique, which the company's own researchers had earlier used to identify a ""tremolite-type"" asbestos in Vermont talc, had one limitation: ""It may be too sensitive.""

In his email to Reuters, J&J's lawyer said the lab supervisor's concern was that the test would result in ""false positives,"" showing asbestos where there was none.

J&J also launched research to find out how much powder a baby was exposed to during a diapering and how much asbestos could be in that powder and remain within OSHA's new workplace exposure limits. Its researchers had strapped an air sampling device to a doll to take measurements while it was powdered, according to J&J memos and the minutes of a Feb. 19, 1974, meeting of the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CTFA), an industry group.

""It was calculated that even if talc were pure asbestos the levels of exposure of a baby during a normal powdering are far below the accepted tolerance limits,"" the minutes state.

In a Sept. 6, 1974, letter, J&J told the FDA that since ""a substantial safety factor can be expected"" with talc that contains 1 percent asbestos, ""methods capable of determining less than 1% asbestos in talc are not necessary to assure the safety of cosmetic talc.""

Not everyone at the FDA thought that basing a detection method on such a calculation was a good idea. One official called it ""foolish,"" adding, according to a J&J account of a February 1975 meeting: ""No mother was going to powder her baby with 1% of a known carcinogen irregardless of the large safety factor.""

PUSH FOR SELF-REGULATION

Having failed to persuade the FDA that up to 1 percent asbestos contamination was tolerable, J&J began promoting self-policing as an alternative to regulation. The centerpiece of this approach was a March 15, 1976, package of letters from J&J and other manufacturers that the CTFA gave to the agency to show that they had succeeded at eliminating asbestos from cosmetic talc.

""The attached letters demonstrate responsibility of industry in monitoring its talcs,"" the cover letter said. ""We are certain that the summary will give you assurance as to the freedom from contamination by asbestos for materials of cosmetic talc products.""

In its letter, J&J said samples of talc produced between December 1972 and October 1973 were tested for asbestos, and none was detected ""in any sample.""

J&J didn't tell the FDA about a 1974 test by a professor at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire that turned up asbestos in talc from J&J - ""fiberform"" actinolite, as he put it. Nor did the company tell the FDA about a 1975 report from its longtime lab that found particles identified as ""asbestos fibers"" in five of 17 samples of talc from the chief source mine for Baby Powder. ""Some of them seem rather high,"" the private lab wrote in its cover letter.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said the contract lab's results were irrelevant because the talc was intended for industrial use. He said the company now believes that the actinolite the Dartmouth professor found ""was not asbestiform,"" based on its interpretation of a photo in the original lab report.

Just two months after the Dartmouth professor reported his findings, Windsor Minerals Research and Development Manager Vernon Zeitz wrote that chrysotile, ""fibrous anthophyllite"" and other types of asbestos had been ""found in association with the Hammondsville ore body"" - the Vermont deposit that supplied Baby Powder talc for more than two decades.

Zeitz's May 1974 report on efforts to minimize asbestos in Vermont talc ""strongly urged"" the adoption of ways to protect ""against what are currently considered to be materials presenting a severe health hazard and are potentially present in all talc ores in use at this time.""

Bicks said that Zeitz was not reporting on actual test results.

The following year, Zeitz reported that based on weekly tests of talc samples over six months, ""it can be stated with a greater than 99.9% certainty that the ores and materials produced from the ores at all Windsor Mineral locations are free from asbestos or asbestiform minerals.""

""MISREPRESENTATION BY OMISSION""

J&J's selective use of test results figured in a New Jersey judge's decision this year to affirm the first verdict against the company in a case claiming asbestos in J&J products caused cancer. ""Providing the FDA favorable results showing no asbestos and withholding or failing to provide unfavorable results, which show asbestos, is a form of a misrepresentation by omission,"" Middlesex County Superior Court Judge Ana Viscomi said in her June ruling.

""J&J respectfully disagrees with the Judge's comments,"" Bicks said. ""J&J did not withhold any relevant testing from FDA.""

The FDA declined to comment on the ruling.

Lacking consensus on testing methods, the FDA postponed action to limit asbestos in talc. Years later, it did set limits on asbestos in talc used in drugs. It has never limited asbestos in cosmetic talc or established a preferred method for detecting it.

Instead, in 1976, a CTFA committee chaired by a J&J executive drafted voluntary guidelines, establishing a form of X-ray scanning with a 0.5 percent detection limit as the primary test, the method J&J preferred. The method is not designed to detect the most commonly used type of asbestos, chrysotile, at all. The group said the more sensitive electron microscopy was impractical.

The CTFA, which now does business as the Personal Care Products Council, declined to comment.

X-ray scanning is the primary method J&J has used for decades. The company also periodically requires the more sensitive checks with electron microscopes. J&J's lawyer said the company's tests exceed the trade association standard, and they do. He also said that today, J&J's X-ray scans can detect suspect minerals at levels as low as 0.1 percent of a sample.

But the company never adopted the Colorado lab's 1973 recommendation that samples be concentrated before examination under a microscope. And the talc samples that were subjected to the most sensitive electron microscopy test were a tiny fraction of what was sold. For those and other reasons, J&J couldn't guarantee its Baby Powder was asbestos-free when plaintiffs used it, according to experts, including some who testified for plaintiffs.

As early as 1976, Ashton, J&J's longtime talc overseer, recognized as much in a memo to colleagues. He wrote that talc in general, if subjected to the most sensitive testing method, using concentrated samples, ""will be hard pressed in supporting purity claims."" He described this sort of testing as both ""sophisticated"" and ""disturbing.""

""FREE OF HAZARD""

By 1977, J&J appeared to have tamped down concerns about the safety of talc. An internal August report on J&J's ""Defense of Talc Safety"" campaign noted that independent authorities had deemed cosmetic talc products to be ""free of hazard."" It attributed ""this growing opinion"" to the dissemination to scientific and medical communities in the United States and Britain of ""favorable data from the various J&J sponsored studies.""

In 1984, FDA cosmetics chief and former J&J employee Heinz Eiermann reiterated that view. He told the New York Times that the agency's investigation a decade earlier had prompted the industry to ensure that talc was asbestos-free. ""So in subsequent analyses,"" he told the paper, ""we really could not identify asbestos or only on very rare occasions.""

Two years later, the FDA rejected a citizen request that cosmetic talc carry an asbestos warning label, saying that even if there were trace contamination, the use of talc powder during two years of normal diapering would not increase the risk of cancer.

In 1980, J&J began offering a cornstarch version of Baby Powder - to expand its customer base to people who prefer cornstarch, the company says.

The persistence of the industry's view that cosmetic talc is asbestos-free is why no studies have been conducted on the incidence of mesothelioma among users of the products. It's also partly why regulations that protect people in mines, mills, factories and schools from asbestos-laden talc don't apply to babies and others exposed to cosmetic talc - even though Baby Powder talc has at times come from the same mines as talc sold for industrial use. J&J says cosmetic talc is more thoroughly processed and thus purer than industrial talc.

Until recently, the American Cancer Society (ACS) accepted the industry's position, saying on its website: ""All talcum products used in homes have been asbestos-free since the 1970s.""

After receiving inquiries from Reuters, the ACS in early December revised its website to remove the assurance that cosmetic talcs are free of asbestos. Now, it says, quoting the industry's standards, that all cosmetic talc products in the United States ""should be free from detectable amounts of asbestos.""

The revised ACS web page also notes that the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies talc that contains asbestos as ""carcinogenic to humans.""

Despite the success of J&J's efforts to promote the safety of its talc, the company's test lab found asbestos fibers in samples taken from the Vermont operation in 1984, 1985 and 1986. Bicks said: ""The samples that we know of during this time period that contained a fiber or two of asbestos were not cosmetic talc samples.""

Then, in 1992, three years after J&J sold its Vermont mines, the new owner, Cyprus Minerals, said in an internal report on ""important environmental issues"" in its talc reserves that there was ""past tremolite"" in the Hammondsville deposit. Hammondsville was the primary source of Baby Powder talc from 1966 until its shutdown in 1990.

Bicks rejected the Cyprus report as hearsay, saying there is no original documentation to confirm it. Hammondsville mine records, according to a 1993 J&J memo, ""were destroyed by the mine management staff just prior to the J&J divestiture.""

Bicks said the destroyed documents did not include talc testing records.

In 2002 and 2003, Vermont mine operators found chrysotile asbestos fibers on several occasions in talc produced for Baby Powder sold in Canada. In each case, a single fiber was recorded - a finding deemed ""BDL"" - below detection limit. Bicks described the finding as ""background asbestos"" that did not come from any talc source.

In 2009, the FDA, responding to growing public concern about talc, commissioned tests on 34 samples, including a bottle of J&J Baby Powder and samples of Imerys talc from China. No asbestos was detected.

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the agency continues to receive a lot of questions about talc cosmetics. ""I recognize the concern,"" he told Reuters. He said the agency's policing of cosmetics in general - fewer than 30 people regulating a ""vast"" industry - was ""a place where we think we can be doing more.""

Gottlieb said the FDA planned to host a public forum in early 2019 to ""look at how we would develop standards for evaluating any potential risk."" An agency spokeswoman said that would include examining ""scientific test methods for assessment of asbestos.""

""FISHING EXPEDITION""

Before law school, Herschel Hobson worked at a rubber plant. There, his job included ensuring that asbestos in talc the workers were exposed to didn't exceed OSHA limits.

That's why he zeroed in on Johnson's Baby Powder after he took on Darlene Coker as a client in 1997. The lawsuit Coker and her husband, Roy, filed that year against J&J in Jefferson County District Court in Beaumont, Texas, is the earliest Reuters found alleging Baby Powder caused cancer.

Hobson asked J&J for any research it had into the health of its mine workers; talc production records from the mid-1940s through the 1980s; depositions from managers of three labs that tested talc for J&J; and any documents related to testing for fibrous or asbestiform materials.

J&J objected. Hobson's ""fishing expedition"" would not turn up any relevant evidence, it asserted in a May 6, 1998, motion. In fact, among the thousands of documents Hobson's request could have turned up was a letter J&J lawyers had received only weeks earlier from a Rutgers University geologist confirming that she had found asbestos in the company's Baby Powder, identified in her 1991 published study as tremolite ""asbestos"" needles.

Hobson agreed to postpone his discovery demands until he got the pathology report on Coker's lung tissue. Before it came in, J&J asked the judge to dismiss the case, arguing that Coker had ""no evidence"" Baby Powder caused mesothelioma.

Ten days later, the pathology report landed: Coker's lung tissue contained tens of thousands of ""long fibers"" of four different types of asbestos. The findings were ""consistent with exposure to talc containing chrysotile and tremolite contamination,"" the report concluded.

""The asbestos fibers found raise a new issue of fact,"" Hobson told the judge in a request for more time to file an opposition to J&J's dismissal motion. The judge gave him more time but turned down his request to resume discovery.

Without evidence from J&J and no hope of ever getting any, Hobson advised Coker to drop the suit.

Hobson is still practicing law in Nederland, Texas. When Reuters told him about the evidence that had emerged in recent litigation, he said: ""They knew what the problems were, and they hid it."" J&J's records would have made a ""100% difference"" in Coker's case.

Had the information about asbestos in J&J's talc come out earlier, he said, ""maybe there would have been 20 years less exposure"" for other people.

Bicks, the J&J lawyer, said Coker dropped her case because ""the discovery established that J&J talc had nothing to do with Plaintiff's disease, and that asbestos exposure from a commercial or occupational setting was the likely cause.""

Coker never learned why she had mesothelioma. She did beat the odds, though. Most patients die within a year of diagnosis. Coker held on long enough to see her two grandchildren. She died in 2009, 12 years after her diagnosis, at age 63.

Coker's daughter Crystal Deckard was 5 when her sister, Cady, was born in 1971. Deckard remembers seeing the white bottle of Johnson's Baby Powder on the changing table where her mother diapered her new sister.

""When Mom was given this death sentence, she was the same age as I am right now,"" Deckard said. ""I have it in the back of my mind all the time. Could it happen to us? Me? My sister?"""
"442","1019894811","2018-12-16","https://thewire.in/law/missing-links-the-supreme-courts-verdict-on-the-rafale-deal","Missing Links: The Supreme Court's Verdict on the Rafale Deal","The Wire",FALSE,"The Wire's founding editor Siddharth Varadarajan and defense analyst Ajai Shukla discuss the questions that remain unanswered.

The following text is a transcribed and edited version of a video conversation held directly after the Supreme Court's judgment on December 14, 2018. Watch the full conversation here.

Siddharth Varadarajan: Today, the Supreme Court ruled judgement on a clutch of petitions that were filed questioning the Rafale deal. The judgment was written by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on behalf of the bench comprising himself and Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K.M. Joseph. Broadly speaking, the court has refused to go into any further enquiry into the purchase of the 36 aircraft.

Today, Ajai Shukla and i will talk you through the logic and arguments that the Chief Justice has presented in his order. Shukla is a defence analyst who has been following the Rafale controversy from day one, when Narendra Modi declared in Paris on April 10, 2015 that India was going to go purchasing 36 Rafale aircrafts on a standalone basis.

Now, the Supreme Court today has said that when it comes to questions of contracts, and in particular, commercial contracts that have a national security implication or bearing, the court's jurisdiction is, perforce, limited. The court does not have a great appetite to go into any fine detail when it comes to evaluating these kinds of contracts except if there is patent illegality, if there is a manifest violation of procedure.

Starting with this caveat where the court says that, look right at the outset, we are approaching this set of petitions on the basis of the fact that we're dealing with what is essentially a national security procurement,

the court then goes into analysing three broad questions that the Rafale deal involves and which the petitioners raised.

The petitioners include M.L. Sharma - who is, as some may say, a person who files PILs quite regularly, but the most important and solid petition was that filed by Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, former cabinet ministers, together with Prashant Bhushan where they essentially asked for a CBI enquiry - a criminal investigation into the purchase.

Now the court highlighted three issues which it said it wanted to go into. The first was the question of process. Did the government follow the specified process in buying 36 aircraft from Dassault Aviation on a flyaway basis? The second is the controversy over pricing. You will recall that pretty much from day one the Congress party, defence analysts and other opposition politicians have been questioning the price at which the Modi government bought these planes, saying that the government has ended up paying too much. The third set of issues, in many ways the most controversial, revolved around the choice of Anil Ambani as one of the key offset partners of Dassault Aviation.

The court traces aspects of the process that the government has followed in settling on this purchase of 36 aircraft and concludes without going into any great detail that even if ""minor deviations"" have occurred, this would not result in either setting aside the contract or requiring a detailed scrutiny by the court. A few sentences later, the court says again that ""broadly"" the processes have been followed. So the court hasn't gone into minute details but seems to have satisfied itself that the broad processes have been followed. Even if there have been minor deviations, the court is not inclined to question this deal. Of course, what these minor deviations have been, the court does not specify.

On the issue of pricing, the court points out that initially, we had said we will look only at the process but in the interest of transparency, we also asked the government to share details of pricing with us. It then says that the government has maintained from the very first day that pricing is a highly sensitive issue and is very careful not to share these issues lest ""enemy countries"" get details of what weaponry the plane carries.

At the end of its very brief analysis on prices, the bench essentially reproduces what the government has claimed. In the operative paragraphs, as per the price details, the government claims that there is a commercial advantage in the purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft. So the court is reiterating what the government is claiming. It is not endorsing it. In fact, the court clearly says ""it is certainly not the job of the court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in such matters"".

So whatever else the court may have said and not said, it has certainly not taken sides on the controversy about whether the Modi government is paying too high a price or whether the price is better as the Modi government has claimed.

On the issue of offsets, which we will discuss in detail, the court has traced the origin of the controversy to the interview given by former French president Francois Hollande, where Hollande had said that the government of India had imposed Anil Ambani on the French side. The court says that under the defence procurement guidelines of 2013, the choice of offset partner is that of the original equipment manufacturer alone, the government has no say. Given that that's what the DPG says and given that both sides denied what Hollande said in his interview, the court sees no reason why it ought to get into what is a commercial decision taken by Dassault Aviation.

The court also said that it wouldn't get into the matter any further and concludes with a somewhat curious reiteration of the centrality of jurisdictional questions under Article 32 of the constitution. The chief justice says that, ""We dismiss all writ petitions. We, however, make it clear that our views as above are primarily from the standpoint of the exercise of the jurisdiction of this court under Article 32 of the constitution of India"". In a way, the court, having entered this minefield and made a broad brush pronouncement in favour of the government, also recognises the limited nature of its own jurisdiction in this kind of a matter. So that, in a nutshell, is what the Supreme Court has said.

Joining me to decode key elements of the judgement is Ajai Shukla. Ajai, you have followed this deal. You wrote extensively on the MMRCA. I recall from when the process started, you were among the first to actually raise questions about Modi's April 2015 surprise announcement when essentially the previous deal was scrapped for all intents and purposes and a new deal was presented in its place.

You've been through the judgment. I want us to talk about it in a sequential manner starting with the preliminary observations of the court. The court says that when it comes to national security matters and when it comes to commercial tenders, 'our appetite is limited, our jurisdiction is limited'.

Do you feel that this is a valid caveat for the court to mention right at the outset?

Ajai Shukla: It would be a valid caveat if the court mentioned it and did not pronounce judgment. But the court has actually said that we have very limited jurisdiction in tenders and contracts dealing with national security but then pronounced a judgment that sounds like it has exonerated the government on all three counts: price, procedure and offset evaluation.

Its a strange sort of judgment in that respect, in which the court has at several places along the judgement - starting from the opening paragraphs - sort of distanced itself from a role in this entire procedure of evaluation but then gotten back into saying that things were more or less okay or somewhat according to procedure, minor deviations from procedure. This seems to me a bit of a contradiction.

SV: Now, focusing on process, we know in the run-up to the judgment, during the arguments in court, even before that, going back to the last couple of years, questions have been raised within the context of the defence procurement guidelines, the manner in which the earlier 126 aircraft process was scrapped and then ws succeeded by a deal involving 36 aircraft.

The government in its written submission to the court - which is unsigned - talked about how the process for withdrawal of the request for proposal was initiated in March before Modi went to Paris. This was the first that we had ever heard of this. In fact, S. Jaishankar, the foreign secretary, on the eve of Modi's visit was speaking as if the old deal was still in the works.

The Dassault Aviation chairman, Eric Trappier, also was speaking in a similar way as was pretty much anybody with any authority in India. But the government says that 'we initiated withdrawal of the proposal and then subsequently went by the letter of the DPG guidelines. Do you think that the court has resolved this issue or do you think it has ignored a lot of objections that were raised simply and chosen not to comment on them?

AS: This is a very incomplete judgment. What's remarkable about this judgment is how much it doesn't address, rather than what it does address, except that it reaches a very firm conclusion. On this issue of the withdrawal of the tender, they can withdraw the tender whenever they like. But the issue really relates to the initiation of a fresh tender and a fresh statement of case which the Air Force, is required to initiate when it goes in for a new tender and a 36 aircraft tender was for all practical purposes a new tender.

Therefore, it should have initiated the statement of case, it should have obtained what they called an acceptance of necessity from the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) and then that goes on to a formal procurement.

SV: The DAC is the apex procurement body within the MoD?

AS: Yes. But a lot of decisions, especially financial decisions in this particular case, have to go up to the cabinet committee on security (CCS) because the competent financial authority, the so-called CFA, is the CCS, because this is a huge contract. So this judgment also mentions that. Now, the issue of whether this process was carried out, this statement of case, this evaluation by the DAC, the accord of a fresh acceptance of the necessity for 36 aircraft. The judgcment is silent about that.

SV: And the government's own submission to the court makes no claim about this in any case.

AS: It doesn't make a claim about it in any case. So, I think, there's also this insinuation that the government got into a strategic procurement - or a procurement on strategic grounds - because it mentions at one stage that the aircraft had carried out mutual Air Force exercises, which is one of the preconditions [for buying weaponry through an intergovernmental agreement].

SV: That was a very slender fig leaf!

AS: Yes, because the basis of procurement was not that the IAF had observed the Rafale in exercises and were besotted with the aircraft! The basis of procurement went all the way back to 2001, when it all started, the need for 126 aircraft, and that was the statement of case and acceptance that went all the way up to the procurement.

SV: The court repeatedly says, by all accounts, that nobody is questioning the capability of the aircraft, that India needs this aircraft and hence we can accept minor deviations in the process because India needs it, India's adversaries have capabilities that India doesn't. Do you think that this argument of necessity is something that ought to be given credence to?

AS: If that were indeed an argument, that the aircraft is so badly needed for India's national security that all processes can be bypassed and all procedures can be bypassed and any price that is necessary can be paid, then the court should say that. It can't say that it's so badly needed for India's security but the prices and processes were badly followed. There seems to be a contradiction over there. Either prices and processes are important or central or they're not and can be thrown out of the window. You can't argue both sides of the fence simultaneously as this judgcment apparently does.

SV: The court quotes from the DPP 2013 as to what the conditions are for going in for an inter-governmental agreement, where you essentially short-circuit many of the processes that you would otherwise involve, and, condition A, is proven technology and capabilities belonging to friendly country is identified by our armed forces while participating in joint exercises; B, large value weapons system platform in service in a friendly country is available for transfer at a much lesser cost, which is clearly not the case; and C, the requirement of procuring a specific state of the art equipment, where the government of the OEM's country may have imposed a restriction on its sale and thus the equipment cannot be evaluated on a no-cost basis. The court seems to accept that these three conditions have not really been fulfilled, but it does say that joint exercises have taken place and that there is a financial advantage to our nation. It seems like a bit of a stretch to cite this as a reason for going in for this.

AS: Looking at it from a distance, it would appear to me, and I suspect to most observers, that the court has got confused by the technicalities of the entire issue. It has cited the technicalities but gone away and said we really don't want to get into this because it's national security and we're under such threat, and fourth generation and fifth generation aircraft are coming into our neighbourhood and we don't have them. Which is incorrect: the Sukhoi is a 4.5 generation aircraft and that's the mainstay of our air force. So that's a factually incorrect statement to make. But the judgment really combines a high degree of ignorance of technicalities with an excuse that technicalities are no longer important because this is such a key national security issue and therefore we don't want to get into it. It's really not what I would call a carefully crafted judgement.

SV: The court seems to have accepted at face value the government's submission that talks have broken down between HAL and Dassault Aviation in the run-up to Modi's visit and hence the process of withdrawing the RFP government claims was initiated in March 2015. In support of this idea of a breakdown of talks between HAL and Dassault, the court cites two claims made by the government: first, that the HAL would require 2.7 times greater man-hours than the French side, and second, that Dassault Aviation was required to undertake necessary contractual obligations and there were issues of the contractual responsibilities that were unresolved.

Now, I've seen interviews by former HAL chairman, Mr Suvarna Raju, who in a way has contradicted this idea that HAL. I was also struck by the court procedure where, in order to validate the idea that you need Dassault, you need Rafale aircraft, the court summoned at very short notice senior serving Indian Air Force officers and subjected them to a rather curious line of questioning. But it didn't do the same to counter-check the government's claims on whether indeed HAL is as bad as the government is suggesting. What's your sense of how valid this argument of the government is? Because that's a key part of this entire process - that HAL couldn't deliver so we couldn't hang around for HAL to close the deal with Dassault Aviation.

AS: I would concur with Suvarna Raju that this is completely invalid. Certainly, the 2.7 factor of labour intensity of the production work is a completely invalid argument for the simple reason that when Dassault submitted its price, it had already factored in HAL's labour cost into the costing of the aircraft. If it had not done so, then Dassault had not done its job, not done its homework. It would have held intensive discussions with HAL, factored in the price and if HAL has 2.7 times more labour intensity, it certainly takes one-third as little as Dassault pays its labour. So that's not an argument at all; that seems to be an entirely falsely constructed argument.

As far as the responsibility for the aircraft produced by HAL is concerned, firstly, the request for proposals for that, the 2007 tender, clearly mentions that the vendor, Dassault, will be responsible for the aircraft's quality and performance. So if Dassault was getting up at a later stage and saying that it would not be responsible for that, it should have been eliminated from the contract immediately. It was no longer in conformity with the terms of the tender. But I don't believe that it was such a killer blow. That is something which language could have easily been used to sort out and had been done.

But more importantly, in March 2015, when the government now says they had initiated the withdrawal of the tender, and the next month the chairman of Dassault was in India, talking up the contract and saying that this is going to be signed within a few days. And the foreign secretary was the next month announcing that the deal was very much on track.

SV: So it's very hard to square all of this. Other issues that have been raised about the process have to do with the question of a lack of a sovereign guarantee, the question of the location of any arbitration proceeding should a dispute rise between India and France. And we've seen a controversy triggered by statements from former defence ministry officials about the benchmark price. One of the officials involved said that the contract negotiation committee was initially tasked with the idea of coming up with a benchmark price and this was changed. The court hasn't gone into the question of benchmark pricing at all.

The court acknowledges that there is a controversy of sovereign guarantee but then says without comment and without passing any judgment that the government claims that it has got a letter of comfort from France. We know the two are not necessarily the same thing, but the court does not go into this. And on the issues of arbitration, where the law ministry had noted on files that arbitration should be in India and that the question of sovereign guarantees is a must, the court chooses simply not to comment on this. Also quite odd.

AS: Certainly, when you are talking about price, any observer of the deal would note that the contract negotiation committee says that there should be a benchmark price of $5.2 billion, and that suddenly goes up to $8.2 billion ... The CNC itself was completely split down the middle; three people were not willing to agree with this. The defence minister to whom it was then referred said, ""I'm not signing on this, let the matter be resolved by the cabinet committee on security (CCS)."" And then the CCS, based on what calculation I don't know, suddenly raised the benchmark price to $8.2 billion, conveniently making the bid price fall within that bracket.

Now, the court seems to have taken no cognisance of that at all. It merely said, these are matters that the government says: that they've obtained it at a cheaper price and they seemed to have taken that at face value. The court has taken everything that the government has said at face value, not realising that the government itself is the subject of this petition, but everything that has been averred by the petitioners is not being treated with that much of care.

SV: In fact, the framing of the judgment's arguments. I was struck by one very curious point which the court says not once but twice. It says that the process was concluded for the 36 aircraft on the 23rd of September 2016 and then it asserts that nothing was called into question then. ""It is only taking advantage of the statement by the President of France Francois Hollande, that these set of petitions have been filed"". So the court essentially appears to have made up its mind that there was no controversy at all until Hollande's statement came, but now this is patently not true! People had questions on day one and as more details emerged, there have been questions asked about this. The opposition has been badgering the government on the question of price for some time, so to say that there was no questioning until Hollande made his statement a few months ago is a bit odd, simply put, it's factually incorrect.

AS: I don't know whether after reading this judgment, the petitioners will come to the conclusion that there are such gaping flaws in this judgment that they would go in for a review petition. They've already reserved the right to do so. Certainly, these are factual inaccuracies that detract from the credibility of this judgment. Also, the court says President Hollande's statement has been comprehensively rebutted from all sides. It has not. It's a very qualified rebuttal that is coming from the French side, where they're not directly contradicting Hollande, merely repeating the line of the Indian government - that is that it's the original equipment manufacturer who decides on the offset partner but - they haven't refuted.

SV: Turning now to the issue of pricing, the court says that initially we were not inclined to go into it. we were going to look only at the process, but then subsequently we decided to do that and we asked the government to give details in a sealed cover given the sensitivity of this material. The judgment deals with pricing in around two pages there's not a lot that the court talks about. It simply reiterates the government's desire to keep things secret. It cites the government's claims that secrecy is built into the contract and built in an India-France treaty and it quotes the Chief of Air Staff saying that he is stated to have communicated his reservation regarding the disclosure of the pricing details, including regarding the weaponry, which could adversely affect national security. The court then essentially acknowledges that these figures haven't been shared with Parliament but it says that the government has shared pricing details with the CAG and with the Public Accounts Committee of parliament. It then - the court to my mind actually refrains from making any qualitative observation on pricing itself. It says, this is what the government claims and then it adds, it is certainly not the job of this court to carry out a comparison of the pricing details in matters like the present."

""The trend of burning crop residue is now catching up in Bihar, which has to be stopped at any cost, otherwise there will be an appalling situation in Bihar... This would not only ruin farmers but would also adversely impact the environment,"" Kumar said, according to an official release.

Earlier, farmers of Rohtas and Kaimur used to burn their post-harvest residue (paddy stalks) but now the farmers of Patna and Nalanda are also burning their crop residue in their fields in large numbers, the CM said.

He asked officials to take the help of Jeevika Didis, women working in self-help groups under the state's Jeevika programme, in convincing farmers about the ill-effects of residue burning on the environment.

Giving directions to Jeevika Programme Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Balamurugan D, Kumar asked him to ""take the help of Jeevika Didis, who are engaged in cultivation, to convince farmers the ill-effects of residue burning on environment.""

In his interaction with Jeevika Didis, Kumar said that the system of burning crop residue in the fields should stop and also asked them to convince people residing in their neighbourhood about its ill-effects.

Kumar was speaking at a function organised at Sonbarsa village in East Champaran district. The CM was there to inspect the potato contract farming being carried out by Jeevika group members in the district.

Under potato contract farming, seeds have been sown in 13 acres for seed potato while sowing has been done in 26 acres for production of potato meant for chips, the release said while quoting Jeevika Didi.

The CM personally inspected the potato contract farming, it said.

Kumar asked Jeevika CEO to promote and expand the contract farming once the experiment here is finished.

Kumar asked the official to ensure that Jeevika Didis must get their minimum support price of their produce, the release said.

In its judgment, the court has made a reference to a CAG report on the aircraft deal. It has said the CAG report was examined by the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament.

But the Congress has insisted that the government presented ""wrong facts"" before the court during the hearing of pleas challenging the aircraft deal with France, which gave the government relief in the cases.

On Saturday, the Centre moved the Supreme Court seeking correction in the judgment, saying ""misinterpretation"" of its note has ""resulted in a controversy in the public domain"".

The Centre made it clear that it did not say the CAG report was examined by the PAC or a redacted portion was placed before Parliament. It clarified the note had said the government ""has already shared"" the price details with CAG, written in past tense and ""is factually correct"".

On Sunday, Sharma said there is no ground for the apex court to even consider the government's petition seeking to correct the judgment. He said the government's conduct and its credentials are certainly ""under dark shadow"" as it has in the process of ""misleading"" the court committed ""a grave act of the breach of privilege of the Parliament which is Sovereign"".

The Parliament is in session and the government surely is in the dock for having committed a grave breach of privilege of not only the PAC, but both the houses of the Indian Parliament.""

He said the Congress has been of this consistent view that the Supreme Court is not the right forum to investigate the issues related to the Rafale deal, to probe, which it has not done and the court itself has said so.

""The Supreme Court judgment is not only self contradictory, but we are shocked to find factual inaccuracies and the aversions which were made, submissions of the government were false,"" he said.

Sharma said the judgment is based on the premise that the government had shared the pricing details with the CAG, which submitted the report through the Public Accounts Committee and portions of that have been shared with Parliament and thus in public domain.

""There has been no CAG report,"" he said, adding Congress leaders had met the CAG a few months ago demanding a ""forensic audit"" of the global tender for the Rafale aircraft deal.

The former union minister said it is mandatory for the CAG to give the report to Parliament, but no such report has been received by Parliament.

He said what has happened is ""unprecedented"" and the government's curative petition filed on Saturday ""adds insult to the injury caused"".

The Supreme Court judgement is clear. Every word said against the Government has proved to be false. Every ""fact"" stated by the vested interests against the deal has proved to be manufactured. Truth has once again established its primacy. The creators of falsehood will still persist with falsehood even at the cost of their own credibility. Only their captive constituencies will clap.

The credentials of the disruptors

Rafale is a combat aircraft with its weaponry required to improve the strike ability of the Indian Airforce. India is geographically located in a sensitive region. It needs to protect itself. The need for such a weapon cannot be overstated. When such defence equipments are purchased obviously some suppliers loose out. The suppliers are clever people. They understand who the ""vulnerables"" in India are.

As a political opponent Rahul Gandhi's opposition to the deal was a desperate attempt. It was the UPA Government which had shortlisted the Rafale as it was technically the best and the cheapest. PM Modi in an Inter- Governmental agreement struck a deal with the French Government to further improve the terms and conditions including the prices on which the UPA had agreed.

File image of finance minister Arun Jaitley. Reuters.

Rahul's opposition was obviously for three reasons :-

Firstly, he could not tolerate the fact that PM Modi has run the cleanest ever Government in recent Indian history. It is a scam-free Government where middlemen and scamsters had to take refuge outside the country.

Secondly, Rahul Gandhi has the burden of a stigmatised legacy which was tainted by Bofors. He was desperate trying to bring an 'immoral equivalence' between Rafale and Bofors. But Rafale did not have middlemen, no kickbacks and obviously no Ottavio Quattrocchi.

Thirdly, with international cooperation and Governmental cooperation, scamsters of the UPA Government are now being extradited into India. There is obviously a scare of who will talk how much.

Rahul Gandhi got instant support from the ""career nationalists"" of Lutyens Delhi. The permanent PIL petitioners have always preferred disruptions over concerns of national security. They are willing to cooperate with any one who hurts India. A new job creation has taken place in Delhi with the ""loud mouths on hire"" and ""subject experts"" notwithstanding their conflict of interest. The disruptionists alliance was, therefore, quite wide.

The lies that were spoken

The fundamental truth that Bofors was a choice both for quality and price by the UPA was forgotten.

The first lie was that only one man - the Prime Minister decided the transaction and that no discussion with the Air Force, Defence Ministry or the Defence Acquisition Council was held. It was alleged that there was no Price Negotiation Committee, no Contract Negotiation Committee and no approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security. Every fact was false. There were dozens of meetings of Contract Negotiation Committee and Price Negotiation Committee. The bulk of the negotiations were done by the experts of the Air Force and the transaction was cleared by both the Defence Acquisition Council and the Cabinet Committee on Security.

The judgement of the Supreme Court notes with satisfaction that procedural compliances have been done and the charges on the same are misconceived.

The second major lie was that as against 500 Million Euros negotiated by the UPA, the NDA paid 1600 Million Euros per aircraft. This accusation was 'fiction writing' and a poor one at that. The Government submitted a sealed cover before the Supreme Court giving details in a comparative chart of the UPA era pricing and the present pricing. It showed that for the first aircraft, Government negotiated a 9% cheaper deal for a bare aircraft and 20% cheaper for a weaponised aircraft compared to the UPA. Since the UPA had negotiated the supply of 18 aircrafts, this gain of 9% and 20% would have further expanded with the supply of aircrafts after the first one since a more favourable escalation clause negotiated by the NDA Government would have further widened the price gap. The Court looked into the prices and never commented adversely on the same.

The third major lie that the judgement of the Court expressed was that the Government of India favoured a particular business house. The Court noticed that the Government has nothing to do with the choice of the offset suppliers which was entirely done by Dassault.

After the Court judgement, this debate should have come to an end. But neither lobbyists nor political opponents will ever give up their brief.

The misconceived demand for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC)

The opponents of Rafale had a choice of their forum to put their facts, they chose Supreme Court as their forum.

The Court conducts a judicial review, it is a non-partisan, independent and a fair Constitutional authority. The Court's verdict is final. It can't be reviewed by anyone except by the Court itself. How can a Parliamentary Committee go into the correctness or otherwise to what the Court has said. Is a Committee of Politicians both legally and in terms of human resources capable of reviewing issues already decided by the Supreme Court? On areas such as procedure, offset suppliers and pricing, can a Parliamentary Committee take a different view of what the Court has said? Can the contract be breached, nation's security be compromised and the pricing data be made available to Parliament / its Committee so that national interest is severely compromised with? This would be putting the price details of the weaponry in public domain. What was the experience of Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the only occasion when they investigated a defence transaction?

The B. Shankaranand Committee in 1987-88 went into the Bofors transaction. Since Parliamentarians are always split on party lines, it came out with a finding that no kickbacks were paid and the monies paid to the middlemen were 'winding up' charges. At that time only Win Chaddha appeared to be a middlemen. But then others including Ottavio Quattrocchi, whose bank accounts got detected subsequently, were not entitled to any winding up charges. The reports / documents published by Chitra Subramanium and N. Ram in 'The Hindu' and all subsequent facts which came to light conclusively established each fact mentioned in the JPC to be factually false. It became a cover up exercise. After the Supreme Court has spoken the last word, it gets legitimacy. A political body can never come to a finding contrary to what the Court has said.

The CAG ambiguity

Defence transactions go to the CAG for an audit review. CAG recommendations go to Parliament and are referred to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) whose reports are then placed before the Parliament. This was factually and accurately stated by the Government before the Court. The audit review of Rafale is pending before the CAG. All facts are shared with it. When its report is out, it will go to the PAC. Notwithstanding this factually correct statement made, if an ambiguity has emerged in the Court Order, the correct course is for anyone to apply / mention before the Court and have it corrected. The past practice is that if in a factual narration anything needs to be corrected, any litigant can move to the Court for the same. This has been done. It must now be left to the wisdom of the Court to state at which stage the CAG review is pending. The CAG review is not relevant to the final findings on procedure, pricing and offset suppliers. But bad losers never accept the truth. Having failed in multiple lies they have now started an innuendo about the Judgement. Having failed in their initial falsehood, the Congress is now manufacturing further lies about the Judgement.

I am certain that the Congress Party will prefer disruptions over discussion on Rafale during the current session of Parliament. On facts it lied. The judgement of the Supreme Court conclusively establishes the Congress Party's vulnerabilities in a discussion on defence transactions. It will be a great opportunity to remind the nation of the legacy of the Congress Party and its defence acquisitions - a great opportunity indeed for some of us to speak.

The former Chelsea manager has endured a tough 2018/19 season at Old Trafford thus far, with a series of lifeless performances seeing the side slump to sixth in the Premier League table - 18 points adrift of current leaders Manchester City. The Red Devils face a rampant Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday, which could slam another nail into Mourinho's managerial coffin at United.

According to the Sun, a member of the United squad informed his friends that Mourinho has lost '90%' of the dressing room support, with the playing staff growing tired of the manager criticising his side in post-match press conferences. The report makes no indication as to who the player is, but claims it is a player otherwise believed to be close to the 'Special One'.

Should United lose to the Reds on Sunday, an outcome that appears increasingly likely given the stark difference in form that the two sides have had this season, pressure will continue to mount from some sections (mainly Twitter-based, let's be honest) of the Red Devils' fanbase to see Mourinho sacked.

However, United have a favourable set of festive fixtures on the horizon, with matches against the likes of Cardiff City, Bournemouth, Huddersfield and Newcastle United. Should Mourinho's side manage to pick up some valuable wins, they could be in with a shout of mounting a challenge for a top-four finish.

In other news, United defender Chris Smalling has signed a contract extension to keep him with the club until 2022. Despite a dire 2017/18 campaign seeing the player fail to make England's World Cup squad, the 29-year-old has extended his eight year stay with the club. Smalling joined the Red Devils in 2010, after two impressive seasons with Fulham."

We do not only want to import here but also export from here to markets like Australia and the US.""

The initial line-up of products to be sourced from India include socks and snacks, he said.

About the local purchase, Liu said by December 2019, around one third products at Miniso India would be sourced locally.

He further added that the company is working in this direction and has already signed contract with some local manufacturers.

The company would also set up small warehouses around tier II & III cities for its new franchise stores.

Miniso launched retail operations in India in August 2017 and clocked Rs 700 crore revenue in one year. It plans to take its storecount to 800 by 2019.

It operates around 3,000 stores in over 70 markets.

The pair buried the hatchet while turning up for Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League.

""...He actually broke down crying, and I could just see that was a huge weight off his shoulders, he had to get rid of it. We shook hands and I gave him a hug and said: 'Mate, it's all good. It's dealt with',"" Symonds told 'Fox Sports'.

Harbhajan, who at time denied any wrongdoing, was suspended for three matches. But the ban was overturned after the visiting team, feeling hard done-by, lodged a protest in what was an all-time low in India-Australia cricket relations.

Reliving, Symonds said, ""We go to a very wealthy man's place for a barbecue, drinks and dinner one night and the whole team's there and he had guests there, and Harbhajan said 'mate, can I speak to you for a minute out in the garden out the front'.

""He goes, 'look, I've got to say sorry to you for what I did to you in Sydney. I apologise, I hope I didn't cause you, your family, your friends too much harm and I really apologise for what I said, I shouldn't have said it'.""

Symonds, who was born in England with one of his parents of West Indian background, has previously recounted how his life went downhill after the incident.

The burly all-rounder, who felt let down by the system, started drinking heavily and in June 2009 his Cricket Australia contract was withdrawn after he was sent home from the World T20 following the latest in a series of alcohol-related indiscretions.

""I suppose this would be the moment where my whole persona to cricket changed,"" Symonds, who is commentating on India's current tour of Australia, said of 'monkeygate'.

""I didn't realise how powerful one player, one incident, how much money was at stake and the ramifications.

While the acid leak incident took place around 10.30 pm on Thursday, forest officials learnt of it only on Saturday. Officials said that staff at the facility tried to suppress the incident by burying the dead animals and birds in a pit on a nearby land.

This place is an industrial zone which has residential colonies located within 1 or 2 km. Karnala bird sanctuary is located about 10 km from this site. The facility was previously owned by Hindustan Organic Chemicals Limited (HOCL) and was recently transferred to Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) too owns some area, said a senior official. All three agencies denied any role in the incident.

Forest officer (Panvel range) Dnyaneshwar Sonawane said, ""The HOCL area (Posari, Panvel) has been given to ISRO and BPCL. Due to exposure to nitric acid on Thursday, monkeys and pigeons died. Our team inspected the area on Saturday and found carcasses of 31 monkeys and 14 rock pigeons.""

He added, ""Our team was surprised to see that the authorities dumped the pigeons and monkeys by digging pits using excavators without informing agencies concerned.""

Assistant conservator of forests (wildlife) Panvel has booked seven BPCL officials and workers, and an excavator driver in this connection. BPCL officials denied the animals were buried on their land.

The area being under tight security, mediapersons and police were restrained from entering the place. Locals said that the number of animals and birds that have died is much more than that being officially put out. According to sources, two security guards were exposed minutely to the nitric acid leak.

Speaking from the spot, deputy conservator of forests Maneesh Kumar said, ""Based on our tip-off, local forest officials were sent to the site on Saturday. A post-mortem was done. Our team noticed pits dug up to bury the animals and birds.""

An ISRO spokesperson said they do not own any plant in Rasayani. Senior officials from the environment department said a team from the pollution control board was sent to the spot on Saturday and its members have been told to submit a report in two days.

A contract worker who spoke on the condition of anonymity said, ""Two security guards at the plant site were exposed to the acid but are safe. The many trees around the plant area make for a good habitat for pigeons and monkeys."""
