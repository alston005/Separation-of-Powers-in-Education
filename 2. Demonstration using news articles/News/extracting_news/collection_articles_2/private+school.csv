The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

State chief electoral officer Anand Kumar has asked district electoral officers (DEOs) to get letters of pledge signed by the students, especially of private schools in cities and towns, so that the voting percentage increases in urban areas.

In the last polls, government school students were asked to fill in the letters of pledge, which led to an increase in voting percentage. For the present assembly polls, Kumar wrote to DEOs last month to involve private school students in the exercise organised under the Systematic Voters' Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) programme, an election commission initiative.

In what is called urban apathy, many city people enrolled in the voters' list do not go to booths to exercise their franchise. Students of private schools will be roped in to nudge their parents and family members to vote, poll officials said.

The parents have been asked to post selfies with their children after voting, showing fingers with indelible ink marks. Three best selfies will be selected for felicitation on the National Voters' Day on January 25, 2019.

""Last time more than 65 lakh letters of pledge were filled in the state. This time the letters of pledge will be filled in from November 12 and submitted to district electoral officers by November 21,"" Kumar said in his letter.

In the 2008 assembly elections the polling percentage was 66.49%, which increased to 75.67% in 2013 in Rajasthan.

District electoral officers will appoint district education officers as nodal officers for the work, who will coordinate with SVEEP committees and schools, the letter said.

Though district education officers do not have direct control over private educational institutions, electoral officers will coordinate with English-medium schools to get the letters of pledge filled in.

""An orientation programme can also be organised at the private schools for the students, so that they can understand the action plan and get inspired to get the letters of pledge filled,"" the letter said."

Meanwhile, three of the four schools run by minority community managements, listed as 'aggrieved parties', are understood to have objected to the 'resolution'.

Strong action

Kumar had created a flutter when he inspected a school in Kollam based on widespread complaints. He proceeded fine the school Rs 2 lakh - the highest ever in the country - for poor infrastructure, unsafe classrooms and several other unfair practices.

Kumar's intervention ended several unfair practices by schools such as collection of huge amounts as 'development fee', charging fees for issuing transfer certificates, collecting 'caution deposit' from teachers, overcharging students for textbooks and conducting unauthorised exams.

Kumar ruffled a few feathers when he took action against a prominent school in the capital for conducting entrance coaching classes outside the school premises but promoting it on its official website. He also cracked the whip on an unauthorised association of school managements from the minority community which fleeced students and compelled them to attend 'talent search exams' having communally divisive content.

■ Undermined the existence of CBSE schools

■ Created 'havoc' in Muslim minority schools

""There's no statutory prohibition for a management to fix a particular fee for an academic year and there's no guideline issued by the CBSE as to how the fee structure should be maintained,"" ruled the High Court recently.

This was in connection with a case in which parents protested the sudden fee hike by a CBSE-affiliated school in Ernakulam. The CBSE regional office has come across instances in which some affiliated schools in the state were found to have collected as many as 20 different types of fees.These included 'Computer Fee' from four-year-old LKG students and fees for conducting talent search exams of private agencies from all students.

CBSE school management representatives played down fleecing instances as 'isolated cases'. ""Most of the CBSE-affiliated schools are charging fees according to the facilities provided to students. It's unfair to cite a few cases and say that all CBSE schools are fleecing students,"" said Kerala CBSE School Management Association general secretary Indira Rajan.

However, frequent complaints on the part of parents have put the spotlight on the need to set up a fee regulatory body for unaided schools on the lines of self-financing professional colleges. Already, states such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam have enacted laws regulating the fee structure of private schools.

Government cites helplessness

""The state government had imposed certain stringent conditions as a prerequisite for granting of NOC to unaided schools with a view to bring in some sort of regulation over such institutions. But the move was turned down by the Supreme court,"" said General Education Secretary A Shajahan.However, the government's sincerity in the matter has been questioned by certain quarters.

""The government is maintaining criminal silence on the issue and has given unaided schools a free hand. If the government has any sincerity, it should urgently bring in a regulatory mechanism to prevent fleecing of students. But that requires strong political will,"" opined education rights activist M Shajarkhan."

Annual fee hike in private schools was cited as one of the key reasons for which students turned to government schools. Jyoti Kumari, who studies in Class VI and has come from Divya Vidya Niketan School, Mohammadpur, said, ""My parents put me in a government school because in private schools, the fee is hiked every year.""

Tough regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools must be eased as soon as possible.

Can launching 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings improve the situation?

The Narendra Modi government is seized of the importance of ensuring the ease of doing business in the country and rightly so. Since 2015, it has taken a series of concerted reforms to climb on the World Bank's annual rankings. The country's big jump from 142 to 100 in just three years is testament to the government's efforts.

A similar if not more urgent initiative is required in facilitating the ease of opening and running a private, unaided school. Though many may frown upon labelling education as a business, but this is all the more reason to show urgency in liberalising the norms and regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools. As India's middle class is expanding, millions of children are leaving government schools and opting for private ones. With time, this trend is likely to get stronger as more and more parents become financially empowered enough to afford private schools.

However, since the passage of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, ease of opening and running a school has become a nightmare.

On the digital and print pages of Swarajya, this writer and others have spilled enough ink detailing the ills ailing the RTE Act. We have repeatedly criticised the policy of keeping minorities out of ambit of the act in toto; important sections like number 12 that mandates 25 per cent quota for students from disadvantaged groups/weaker sections in private unaided non-minority schools; section 13 that bars any kind of screening for admitting students; section 16 which allows mandatory promotion to the next class irrespective of the performance and learning; and so on.

However, one important aspect of the act that has escaped the much needed scrutiny is the set of regulations surrounding the recognition of a school which is the fundamental requirement to run a school. Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE deal with rules and restrictions in this regard.

These state that no private school shall be established or run without obtaining a certificate of recognition from the appropriate government authority on fulfilling certain norms and standards as laid out in Schedule in such form and manner, within such period, and subject to such conditions as laid out in rule 11 and rule 12 of ""Model Rules Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

What are the norms and standards set out in the Schedule? First, the minimum number of teachers a school must have from classes I to VIII depending on the strength of the class. Second, the building requirements (kitchen, playground, number of classrooms, etc). Third, minimum number of working days in a year. Fourth, minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher. Fifth, use of teaching aid for each class. Sixth, library. Seventh, play material, games, and sports equipment.

What do the rule 11 and 12 of Model Rules say? After conforming to the above norms, every school has to fill out Form 1 declaring that:

the school is run by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force;the school is not run for profit to any individual, group or association of individuals or any other persons;the school conforms to the values enshrined in the Constitutionthe school buildings or other structures or the grounds are used only for the purposes of education and skill development;the school is open to inspection by any officer authorised by the state government/local authority;the school furnishes such reports and information as may be required by the Director of Education/District Education Officer from time to time and complies with such instructions of the state government/local authority as may be issued to secure the continued fulfillment of the condition of recognition or the removal of deficiencies in working of the school

Apart from these, there are eight tables of details to be filled in Form 1 such as:

Then the District Education Officer (DEO) carries out an inspection to see if the requirements have been met and give the certificate of recognition. However, it is temporary, to be renewed every three years and is only for primary classes i.e. up to standard VIII. For higher classes, there are separate, and similarly, those who run schools without obtaining a certificate of recognition can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 per day.

As if these onerous requirements, especially the ones highlighted, were not enough, it is pertinent to note that these are merely those mandated by the central act. The states have their own, additional level of requirements. Most prominent of these is 'Essentiality certificate"" aka the 'no objection certificate' awarded by the state government's Department of Education for five years.

Even by-laws of central boards like the CBSE insist on this prized possession as preliminary necessity before giving affiliation to schools. On top of all this, there are permissions and plans - building, health, water, land use permitted, etc - to be sought from municipality.

The situation is so bad that even elite schools with decades of reputation of delivering great service and education have to face extreme levels of bureaucratic red-tapism. Sachin Tendulkar's school Shardashram Vidyamandir wanted to amend affiliation board from SSC to ICSE for Class 1 to Class IV and also wanted to change its name. Both the requests were dismissed by BMC officials stating that it has given NOC for SSC board till 2020 so it must continue with the same.

If this is the condition for established players who can be treated in such a manner by a municipal corporation, one can imagine what effect they will have on genuine players willing to enter the field. The regulations can induce bouts of trauma into even the most spirited of edupreneurs.

The language of the RTE Act and other rules indicates that the State is more concerned with reigning in the growth of private schools than facilitating right to education for everyone in reality.

While the regulations provide for elaborate monetary punishments which can even lead to closure of the school for not getting the recognition, there is hardly anything about the government's laxity in giving the certificates. The Haryana government is yet to grant recognition for around 3,200 private schools operating since 2003 in the state. Without recognition they can't even apply to the Haryana board for affiliation. Wonder why no act penalises the government, say Rs 10,000 per day per school, for each day's delay in granting recognition (or rejecting it as the case may be)? Even if these schools are given recognition, it will only be for a year. The situation is similar in Odisha and Kerala too. The future of thousands of schools in the country, year after year, depends on government's arbitrary decisions.

Also, the government can announce any new set of arbitrary conditions as the Uttar Pradesh government did recently when it made it mandatory for all schools to install CCTVs and biometric machines for attendance to seek recognition from the UP board.

And if the schools protest, the government can pass an order ruling that agitating against the government can lead to withdrawal of recognition as the Chandigarh education department did this year.

Such a regime is bad enough for any business. It's disastrous and suicidal to have it in private education sector which is the only hope left for the lower middle class and poor to climb up the social and economic ladder. Every day we continue with this system, we are inflicting great damage to the students from the lower strata of our populace who are highly disproportionately enrolled in the failed government schools. In its zeal to put a leash on private schools in the name of curbing profiteering, what the government has achieved is monopoly of those who are now experts at gaming the system through underhanded ways and means. The genuine educationists and philanthropists dare not enter the market.

What can the Modi government do? For starters, it can launch national 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings. Second, it can reform the norms and procedures needed for recognition mentioned in the schedule at the back of the RTE Act. It can be done by a simple government notification as section 20 of the act mandates. There is no need for ratification by the Parliament.

To realise the goal of universal quality education, which is affordable too, the state must facilitate proliferation of private schools leading to competition. This will do more to curb profiteering than any fee regulation act ever could."

As the monsoon is not far away, local people allege the school is flirting with danger and risking the lives of its students by operating in a high-risk flood zone.

""The school is situated at the junction where an outlet channel of the Chembarambakkam lake and the Adyar river meet. This means if water is released from the lake, the school will be the first building to be hit,"" said O Udayakumar, a resident of Thiruneermalai.

According to locals, the entire area right upto the base of the nearby hill, which is, at least, one km from the school, was submerged in water upto the first floor of several buildings during the 2015 floods.

This means a repeat could completely submerge the school which is just a stone's throw away from the Adyar river and the Chembarambakkam water channel.

Interestingly, the school seems to have sacrificed 'safety for the aesthetics'.

The school buildings have been constructed right next to the river bank instead of the other extremity, which would allow some breathing space in case of emergency, though disallowing the picturesque view it boasts of now.

Though construction works were completed last year, this primary school began functioning only two months ago with a strength of 50 students and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

When Express contacted the school's management over the issue, they downplayed the risks the school faces from flooding. ""We have raised the floor two metres and will build a four-metre compound wall,"" said an official, claiming the school's basement has been sealed as a safety measure.

However, locals, who witnessed the flooding in 2015, said that no wall would stand a chance of fighting the raging water.

""Everyone just remembers 2015 because it is the most recent incident of flooding. At least, once in five years, there is flooding. It is more common than people think,"" said Udayakumar, adding that the monsoon doesn't even have to be as bad as 2015 to cause flooding."

On Sunday, the victim K Krithiga (28), teacher in a private school, has sustained labour pain. However, she was not rushed to any of the hospitals over there. With love for natural medicine, Krithiga's husband Karthikeyan and their friends Praveen and Lavanya have assisted the pregnant women in giving birth in a natural way at their home.

Nevertheless, none of the three persons was medically qualified. ""All the three have only learnt it by watching videos in YouTube,"" said a police official. According to sources, on Sunday after delivering a baby, Krithiga went unconscious as she lost lot of blood in the placental bleed. Soon she was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.

The incident became known only after they took the body to Tirupur Government Hospital, where the doctors sought for a medical certificate from them. As the family members did not have any medical certificate, they lodged a formal complaint in the Nallur police, who have filed a case of suspicious death and are probing into the matter.

The incident has come as a shock to the health officials as there were no records that Krithiga is pregnant. ""She has not consulted the doctor, right from the time of pregnancy. We have only the details of her first pregnancy,"" a health department official said.

However, we have asked the details about her to her family members. Meanwhile, Reproductive and Child Health Commissioner Darez Ahammed has asked for a detail inquiry report in this regard. While the police officials confirm that the three person have helped her in giving birth with the Youtube tutorial videos, Darex Ahammed was not sure about it and said that he would come to know only after he gets the report.

It may also be recalled that in Coimbatore, a woman had given birth to a baby in a similar manner and it came out only when she approached a doctor as the child's placenta was infected."

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

A case of causing death due to negligence was booked against the van driver and the school management. M Ravi Kumar, Sub Inspector Shabad Police station said that the school van though had all necessary permissions, it had no attender to take care of the kids.

Momula Chandrashekar Reddy and Lavanya, a farmer couple from Gopigadda village under Shabad Mandal, had two kids Satvik Reddy(4) and Adhya (21 months).

A week ago, Satwik was admitted to Sumedha Montessori School located at Shabad town in LKG. On Monday morning, when the school van no TS 07UA 0495 came to pick up the kids, Lavanya took Satvik to the van halted on the main road, located a few meters away in front of their house. Without their knowledge, Adhya crawled behind them. While Lavanya was busy helping Satvik board the van, Adhya also came near the bus and stood in front of the van near the left tire.

After Satwik boarded the van, the van driver Jangaiah aged around 35 years started the vehicle, not noticing the child standing near the front wheel.

""As a result, the child came under the front wheel of the vehicle and died on the spot as the wheel crushed her. There were more than 20 kids in the vehicle at the time of the incident,"" said Ravi Kumar.

As per the norms, the vehicle should have an attender to take care of the kids, but since the school management did not employ an attender, the school management along with the van driver is booked for causing death due to negligence.

The body of the girl was handed over to the family after an autopsy and the driver was detained for questioning."

After a report in Pune Newsline highlighted how the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was indulging discriminatory practice vis-a-vis cash awards to SSC students from civic schools and private schools, the civic administration on Wednesday decided to tweak the rule and increase the prize money for meritorious students from private schools. Hundreds of meritorious students from private schools are expected to benefit from the move as now they will receive Rs one lakh instead of Rs 15,000, which was decided earlier.

On June 9, Pune Newsline had highlighted the fact that 18 PCMC-run school students who secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will get Rs one lakh cash reward while private school students within PCMC limits will get only Rs 15,000, a practice in force for past few years.

Civic activists had called for an end to this discriminatory practice. Taking note of the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad BJP president Laxman Jagtap, MLA had urged the civic administration and the standing committee to provide justice to private school students. As a result, a meeting by the standing committee was held on June 5, where it was announced that students from private schools who come under the below poverty line and have secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will also get Rs one lakh cash reward.

However, BJP leaders like city general secretary Sarang Kamtekar and PCMC House leader Eknath Pawar said they were in favour rewarding meritorious SSC students from economically weaker sections. ""PCMC should honour students who come from poor sections of the society and have secured more than 90 per cent marks. Like students who live in one room chawls, sons and daughters of autorickshaw drives and vegetable vendors,"" he said. Pawar said he too would take up the issue with the Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar.

When contacted, Hardikar said the idea was good and he would work out the budget for it. ""We will have to see how many students fall in the category and whether we are in a position to provide the funds. But the idea is good...we need to honour the poor and meritorious students,"" he said.

According to PCMC officials, last year over 1100 students from private schools had secured more than 90 per cent marks. ""These students included the poor as well as the rich,"" he said, adding that the figure of EWS students would be in the range of around 400. Officials said EWS families are those who monthly income is less than Rs 15,000."

The 45-year-old man, however, managed to get four of them, including three women, arrested with the help of his politician uncle.

A pimp, apparently husband of a former police clerk, and one of his accomplices are still at large, said police.

Preliminary probe revealed the music teacher on Sunday called up Jitender Parwana, the pimp, whom he had known since 2010, to fix a meeting with a call girl. Parwana shared with the teacher the mobile number of a woman.

Accordingly, the teacher called the woman, who asked him to share his photo on WhatsApp and fixed a 'deal' for Rs 2,000.She then asked him to come to her third-floor flat at a residential society on Basai Road.

When the teacher reached there around 11.15am, the woman claimed she was pregnant and thus sent him to another woman. The second woman, suspected to be the kingpin, subsequently sent the teacher to another woman. But as he went to meet the third woman inside a room (in the same flat), a few people alleged that he was trying to rape her.

""Parwana, Rakesh and Rahul, along with the two women, barged into the room and threatened to call police and frame me in a case. They asked me to cough up Rs 2 lakh and snatched my motorcycle key, Aadhaar card and driving licence. In the meantime, two men in police uniform reached the spot and warned me of action if I did not pay the money,"" the teacher later told police.

The teacher asked them to send someone with him to his home and promised to pay the money there. But instead of going home, he, accompanied by Rakesh, went to his politician uncle's house. The teacher confided everything in his uncle and sought his help. The uncle then called police.

While a team went straight to the Basai Road flat and nabbed the three women, another team reached the uncle's house and picked up Rakesh.

Based on the teacher's complaint, an FIR was filed against the six people under sections 323 (causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 389 (putting person in fear for extortion), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and various sections of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act at Sector 9A police station. The four arrested were produced in a city court on Monday. While the first woman was taken on two-day police remand, the others were sent to judicial custody.

""The accused were involved in a sex racket being run from a residential area. They were trying to blackmail the music teacher. We are conducting raids to nab others,"" said inspector Sudhir Kumar, SHO of Sector 9A police station."

This decision was taken during a meeting attended by several private school managements' associations on Friday.

D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements' of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said the regulatory body will look into various issues such as exorbitant fee hikes by school managements and implementation of Kannada as the first or second language as mandated in the Kannada Language Learning Act 2016.

As many as 7,000 schools are under the umbrella of four private school associations in the State.

Association members will lodge a complaint with the officials of the Department of Public Instruction against erring school managements.

""In many instances, parents do not come forward to lodge complaints as they feel their child will be targeted. This move is to ensure that complaints reach the Education Department,"" a member of the management of a school said.

According to Mr. Kumar, the associations will also visit schools and ensure that the fee structure is displayed on the notice board as per the rules. ""Another area of concern is that many school managements are collecting excess fees from parents for books and uniforms. While collecting around ₹8,000 to ₹10,000 is acceptable, they should be penalised for anything more than this,"" he said.

V.R.N. Reddy, president, Karnataka Unaided Schools' Management Association, said there was a need to set up a nodal officer in the State who can address the grievances of private school managements.

An official of the Education Department said that while this was a welcome move, the sole grievance redressal and penalty mechanism lied with the department and urged parents to approach them if they found school managements violating norms."

In the run-up the admission season this year, the CPM-controlled panchayat had launched a sustained 'people's movement' against unrecognised private schools.

""Our target was to bring at least half of the students in unrecognised schools back to government-run schools,"" she said. ""There was a perception that private schools are better. We showed the facts. This particular private school does not even have a playground,"" she said.

Ahead of the campaign, the panchayat conducted a survey and found that 354 students from Kayyur-Cheemeni were studying in unrecognised schools. ""We managed to get 132 of them to government-run schools this academic year,"" she said. The president said the panchayat was not wrapping up the campaign. ""It is an ongoing conversation with the parents to convince them that government schools are better than unrecognised schools,"" she said.

The panchayat has set itself a target of 2020 to bring all the students in unrecognised schools to government-aided or run schools, and stop new enrolment in such schools. There are two unrecognised schools in the panchayat.

""In the second school, only 50% of its UKG students joined its class I,"" said K M Anil Kumar, a school teacher and convenor of the Panchayat Public education Protection Committee, formed to steer the campaign. He said Government Higher Secondary School in Cheemeni attracted 35 of the 132 students who left unrecognised schools. ""It is the highest,"" he said.

The private schools which lost two batches had 26 students in class 7 and nine students in class 8.

""Instead of joining the next level, all the 33 students took their TC and joined neighbouring schools,"" said Anil Kumar.

In all, 77 students joined government schools in Kayyur-Cheemeni and 55 students joined schools in neighbouring Pilocode. Kelappaji Memorial High School at Kodakkad in Pilocode got 20 students because of the campaign.GUPS, Padikeen enrolled 19 students, Government Welfare UP School, Kodakkad, got 15 students, and GUPS, Nalilkkandam, got 13 students from unrecognised schools.

The panchayat said it had conducted Education Gram Sabhas in all wards and door-to-door campaigns to persuade the parents to exit unrecognised schools. It said it was planning to conduct special tuition classes for students weak in mathematics, English and science.

""It was a demand that came from parents during gram sabha meetings urging the panchayat to make an intervention,"" said the convenor. The panchayat said it would roll out a scheme for the students this month itself."

The commission directed the Deputy Director of Public Instructions (North) and Block Education Officer (North 2) to identify the schools which require computers.

The Commission directed Daffodils English School in Sanjay Nagar to purchase five computers for each of the five government schools in the neighbourhood within a fortnight.

The Commission found that the school management had punished students by making them run five laps in the playground, stand under the hot sun for an hour and insisting that they wear shoes of a particular brand. The school had also absolved itself of all responsibility for the safety of students and said the onus fell on the parents.

After a parent approached the Commission in April alleging that their child was denied a report card resulting in mental harassment, the Commission conducted an inquiry into the practices followed by the school.

The inquiry revealed that when parents failed to pay the annual feels, the school authorities inked a note on the child's arm. ""It was also found that students were forced to take international assessment, and fees were collected even if a child was not interested in it. No parent teacher meeting was conducted, and fees were taken illegally from students admitted under the RTE quota,"" a source in the Commission said.

Parents were also allegedly forced to shell out Rs. 400 for tickets to the school's annual day function.

The management also did not disclose bank details of the school.

In its reply to the Commission, the school said that results of those children who had not paid their fees had been withheld.

The Commission, in its order, stated that the school had failed 'in its basic duty of giving opportunity to each and every child to not only excel in academics but also in co-curricular activities'. It directed the management to remove a clause in the school diary, which insisted that students had to wear shoes of a particular brand, and noted that parents should be free to buy books from any source. The school has also been forbidden from withholding mark cards, forcing children to take the competitive international exam or charging for annual functions.

It has also issued a warning that as long as children are in school or on a field trip, their safety is the responsibility of the school.

The Deputy Director of Public Instruction and the Block Education Officer have been directed to identify schools that lack computers, and ensure that they get the same within a fortnight.

The inquiry report, submitted to the Faridkot deputy commissioner, also found that the panchayat in1988 misused its powers by allotting the village common land to the school without the government's approval.

The report has recommended to the rural development and panchayat department to initiate the process to vacate the land and recover the losses from the school.

Violation of SC order

The inquiry found that the allocation of land was in violation of the Supreme Court judgement that said the ""state government permitting allotment of gram sabha land to private persons and commercial enterprises on payment of some money is illegal"".

Violation of common land act

The inquiry found that panchayat gave the land to the school for free. Moreover, the school has opened a bank and a dental hospital on its premises in violation of Section 5 of the Punjab Village Common Land (Regulation) Act, 1961, which states that all land vested or deemed to have been vested in a panchayat shall be utilised for the benefit of the village.

In April, the district development and panchayat officer office had said the Bargari panchayat passed the resolution and gave land to the school unconditionally. They also sent a resolution to the state government for land transfer but failed to get an approval for the same.

The district education officer (secondary) office's records reveal the school was running without any affiliation till 2013. The department gave affiliation to the school under the Right to Education Act in 2013.

There's something rotten in the state of medical education and care in the country, stemming from a deep deficiency of emotional intelligence (EI) among medical students, the survey, conducted by researchers Subhashini Sundararajan and Dr. Vijayaprasad Gopichandran from Chennai's ESIC Medical College & PGIMSR, found.

Published in the journal BMC Medical Education, the survey of 207 medical students found that those who came from government schools consistently had greater emotional intelligence than those from private schools, something Gopichandran had observed as a teacher at ESIC.

Students on an average scored 107.58 out of a maximum score of 160 for EI, with government school students consistently scoring more. The study found that factors like age, gender, urban/rural nativity did not have as significant an impact on the scores, as much as schooling did.

The survey held the ""collectivist social setting"" of government schools and the stress on individualism in private schools responsible for this.

""Government schools across the country suffer from resource deprivation and students have really struggled. Their learning ends up happening in a collective, collaborative kind of manner, "" Gopichandran elaborated on how such a survey could have similar results all over

India.

""Kids from the best private schools have trouble adapting to a medical college, and in coping with how difficult their course is, because they're not comfortable studying collectively,"" he added. Students from government schools band together more easily, sharing notes and the burden of work, and offering help, while private school kids are mostly seen trying to study on their own with earphones on.

This, he pointed out, has become more noticeable post the NEET exam, with dramatically reduced the number of students from government schools entering medical colleges.

Such behaviour may be indicative of how students interact with patients once they start practicing medicine. The inability to listen to a patient has damaged the trust implicit between the doctor and the patient. Previous studies, said Gopichandran, showed that

if a patient is allowed to talk uninterrupted for two minutes, it dramatically reduces the overall time needed to give a correct diagnosis.

""Emotional intelligence does not take time,"" he said refuting arguments that doctors in India's government hospitals don't have the time to emotionally invest in patients. ""It is a matter of a couple of minutes, of the correct body language, the ability to listen, a simple hand on the patient's shoulder,"" he said, drawing from his own practice and from that of his mentors during his student days.

Unfortunately, students now don't get to interact with such doctors. They're few and far in between and students mostly learn from the colder behaviour of their own teachers.

""The rise of specialty and super specialty practices has meant that there are very fewer general physicians practicing ethical medicine. Patients aren't seen as whole people but as organs,"" said Gopichandran. ""I can't blame the students,"" he added, ""they're responding

to a market that only rewards those with most degrees.""

As his survey pointed out, private school students were deeply uncomfortable with getting to know their patients fearing their objectivity would be lost. They also thought of anger and a paternalistic attitude towards patients as necessary tools to make them stick to treatment regimes.

In such cases, the doctor and the patient tend to get trapped in a vicious cycle of diminishing trust, each responding negatively to the other. As the survey pointed out, this has led to a rush of violent attacks on doctors by patients and their attendants in the past few years.

However, ""emotional intelligence is a cognitive process,"" Gopichandran told News18, adding that it can be taught, something he himself learnt from researchers at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences who are teaching EI to policemen.

On the basis of this survey, Gopichandran and Sundarajan, who is his student as well has the lead author, are preparing a policy brief for the National Medical Council (NMC), to incorporate EI into medical training. Not as a separate lecture, he said, but as part of every course and for every teacher to impart.

""There has to be a focus on primary healthcare and on pushing students to explore medicine instead of fast-tracking their careers to corporate hospital jobs."" Gopichandran said. Lamenting that there is no joy left in medicine anymore, the researcher stressed that such attitudes needed changing."

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

Kumar, against whom a few managers have raised the war cry, had earned all-round appreciation from students and parents across the state after he proactively intervened and stopped unhealthy practices that were going on unchecked in CBSE schools.

Recently, an 'unanimous resolution' on the letterhead of the Kerala CBSE School Management Association was submitted as a memorandum to Kumar and a copy was sent to member schools. The association has around 1,400 schools as members.

Signed by association president T P M Ibrahim Khan, the 'resolution' listed out recent 'actions' of Kumar which, if repeated, ""would adversely affect even the existence of CBSE schools in the state.""

The 'resolution' also interpreted actions taken by Kumar as ""creating havoc among schools, especially in Muslim minority schools.""

It said the RO's orders had ""created disappointment among the minority community.""

'Resolution unauthorised'

Ironically, the association's general secretary and working president have come out against the 'resolution'. Sources said they had asked the president (Ibrahim) why such a 'resolution' was prepared without the executive committee's authorisation.

Meanwhile, three of the four schools run by minority community managements, listed as 'aggrieved parties', are understood to have objected to the 'resolution'. It is learnt schools which distanced themselves from the resolution were opposed to being used as pawns to build a case against Kumar, who has an impeccable track record.

Strong action

Kumar had created a flutter when he inspected a school in Kollam based on widespread complaints. He proceeded fine the school Rs 2 lakh - the highest ever in the country - for poor infrastructure, unsafe classrooms and several other unfair practices.

Kumar's intervention ended several unfair practices by schools such as collection of huge amounts as 'development fee', charging fees for issuing transfer certificates, collecting 'caution deposit' from teachers, overcharging students for textbooks and conducting unauthorised exams.

Kumar ruffled a few feathers when he took action against a prominent school in the capital for conducting entrance coaching classes outside the school premises but promoting it on its official website. He also cracked the whip on an unauthorised association of school managements from the minority community which fleeced students and compelled them to attend 'talent search exams' having communally divisive content.

THE 'CHARGES'

■ Undermined the existence of CBSE schools

■ Created 'havoc' in Muslim minority schools

ACTIONS TAKEN

Mahesh, who was making a point about how strict discipline, in his opinion, kills creativity, went on to compare students of such schools to 'parrots'. Praising government schools, Mahesh said teachers there are ""more intelligent than private school teachers."" After talking about teachers, the minister then shifted his attention to children, comparing those in government school to 'eagles'.

He was talking at an event organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) in the city to honour the 'Ambassadors' of old students associations at government schools. According to Mahesh, private school teachers act like nuns as they are very disciplined and serious.

""If you visit any private school in the state after 10 am, there will be pin-drop silence and kids will be waiting for the day to get over and fly like free birds. As the teachers at private schools are like nuns, serious and more disciplined, kids will also be serious and seriousness kills creativity,"" Mahesh said.

Comparing government and private school teachers, the minister said, ""100% of our government school teachers are more intelligent than teachers at private schools. The only problem is of co-ordination between teachers and students which is not happening and if that happens, our government school kids will overtake private school kids,"" the minister said.

The minister then likened private school children to parrots and government school kids to eagles. ""Private school kids will become parrots and government school kids eagles. Parrots just do what they are asked to do. But government school kids fight for their rights by discussing and fighting with teachers. According to me, those who are naughty in the classroom are intelligent and not the ones who just listen to everything in the class,"" he said.

According to the minister, those who studied at private schools will not pay back to society and they will only look for job opportunities abroad. ""Our government school kids will remain in the state, even if they become a teacher, constable or driver. They will give back to the society by staying here,"" he added.

private schools condemn comment

The statements by the minister were condemned by private school managements. The managements even demanded the minister's resignation for what they termed as ""irresponsible"" statements and for violating rights of the children by discriminating between government and private school kids. D Shashi Kumar, General Secretary of the Associated Management of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka said, ""How can the minister give such immature and irresponsible statements? e demand that the minister step down."""

He was speaking at a convention of Government Schools Old Students' Association organised by the Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Saturday. He later justified his statements and said, ""A lot of discipline kills creativity."" He drew on the analogy of birds to reference modes of learning.

'English only as a language in govt. schools'

Clearing the confusion over introduction of English in government schools, Mr. Mahesh on Saturday said English would be taught effectively only as a language in 1,000 government schools.

The decision was taken in a meeting on road safety, chaired by deputy commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh, on Wednesday.

""Overloaded vans put children's lives at risk. We will not allow private vans to carry more children than the subscribed limit. We will run a special campaign to challan private van operators who flout the rules,"" Munish Sharma, additional deputy commissioner, said.

In line with its Surakshit Vahan Policy, there are committees at the state-, district- and sub-district levels that have laid down rules for ensuring safety of schoolchildren.

As per the policy, vehicles engaged in carrying schoolchildren cannot ferry children in excess of 1.5 times the vehicle's registered seating capacity. However, poor implementation of rules and lax monitoring has failed to keep a check on accidents involving these vans.

Sharma said 50 private van drivers of different schools had been issued a ticket by the Regional Traffic Authority in September alone.

The administration has also directed all schools to keep a record of details of vendors who ferry children. Information such as the driver's name, mobile number and number of children being ferried should be made available, the rules stipulate.

Sharma informed that the administration was keeping a check on underage drivers. ACP, traffic Hawa Singh , who was also present in the meeting, said that in the last three months, 135 fines were issued for underage driving in the district.

""We have told all schools to ensure that children do not travel in vans that are crammed beyond capacity.

""There's no statutory prohibition for a management to fix a particular fee for an academic year and there's no guideline issued by the CBSE as to how the fee structure should be maintained,"" ruled the High Court recently.

This was in connection with a case in which parents protested the sudden fee hike by a CBSE-affiliated school in Ernakulam. The CBSE regional office has come across instances in which some affiliated schools in the state were found to have collected as many as 20 different types of fees.These included 'Computer Fee' from four-year-old LKG students and fees for conducting talent search exams of private agencies from all students.

CBSE school management representatives played down fleecing instances as 'isolated cases'. ""Most of the CBSE-affiliated schools are charging fees according to the facilities provided to students. It's unfair to cite a few cases and say that all CBSE schools are fleecing students,"" said Kerala CBSE School Management Association general secretary Indira Rajan.

However, frequent complaints on the part of parents have put the spotlight on the need to set up a fee regulatory body for unaided schools on the lines of self-financing professional colleges. Already, states such as Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam have enacted laws regulating the fee structure of private schools.

Tough regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools must be eased as soon as possible.

Can launching 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings improve the situation?

The Narendra Modi government is seized of the importance of ensuring the ease of doing business in the country and rightly so. Since 2015, it has taken a series of concerted reforms to climb on the World Bank's annual rankings. The country's big jump from 142 to 100 in just three years is testament to the government's efforts.

A similar if not more urgent initiative is required in facilitating the ease of opening and running a private, unaided school. Though many may frown upon labelling education as a business, but this is all the more reason to show urgency in liberalising the norms and regulations governing the establishment and administration of private schools. As India's middle class is expanding, millions of children are leaving government schools and opting for private ones. With time, this trend is likely to get stronger as more and more parents become financially empowered enough to afford private schools.

However, since the passage of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, ease of opening and running a school has become a nightmare.

On the digital and print pages of Swarajya, this writer and others have spilled enough ink detailing the ills ailing the RTE Act. We have repeatedly criticised the policy of keeping minorities out of ambit of the act in toto; important sections like number 12 that mandates 25 per cent quota for students from disadvantaged groups/weaker sections in private unaided non-minority schools; section 13 that bars any kind of screening for admitting students; section 16 which allows mandatory promotion to the next class irrespective of the performance and learning; and so on.

However, one important aspect of the act that has escaped the much needed scrutiny is the set of regulations surrounding the recognition of a school which is the fundamental requirement to run a school. Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE deal with rules and restrictions in this regard.

These state that no private school shall be established or run without obtaining a certificate of recognition from the appropriate government authority on fulfilling certain norms and standards as laid out in Schedule in such form and manner, within such period, and subject to such conditions as laid out in rule 11 and rule 12 of ""Model Rules Under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009"".

What are the norms and standards set out in the Schedule? First, the minimum number of teachers a school must have from classes I to VIII depending on the strength of the class. Second, the building requirements (kitchen, playground, number of classrooms, etc). Third, minimum number of working days in a year. Fourth, minimum number of working hours per week for the teacher. Fifth, use of teaching aid for each class. Sixth, library. Seventh, play material, games, and sports equipment.

What do the rule 11 and 12 of Model Rules say? After conforming to the above norms, every school has to fill out Form 1 declaring that:

the school is run by a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 (21 of 1860), or a public trust constituted under any law for the time being in force;the school is not run for profit to any individual, group or association of individuals or any other persons;the school conforms to the values enshrined in the Constitutionthe school buildings or other structures or the grounds are used only for the purposes of education and skill development;the school is open to inspection by any officer authorised by the state government/local authority;the school furnishes such reports and information as may be required by the Director of Education/District Education Officer from time to time and complies with such instructions of the state government/local authority as may be issued to secure the continued fulfillment of the condition of recognition or the removal of deficiencies in working of the school

Apart from these, there are eight tables of details to be filled in Form 1 such as:

Then the District Education Officer (DEO) carries out an inspection to see if the requirements have been met and give the certificate of recognition. However, it is temporary, to be renewed every three years and is only for primary classes i.e. up to standard VIII. For higher classes, there are separate, and similarly, those who run schools without obtaining a certificate of recognition can be fined up to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 10,000 per day.

As if these onerous requirements, especially the ones highlighted, were not enough, it is pertinent to note that these are merely those mandated by the central act. The states have their own, additional level of requirements. Most prominent of these is 'Essentiality certificate"" aka the 'no objection certificate' awarded by the state government's Department of Education for five years.

Even by-laws of central boards like the CBSE insist on this prized possession as preliminary necessity before giving affiliation to schools. On top of all this, there are permissions and plans - building, health, water, land use permitted, etc - to be sought from municipality.

The situation is so bad that even elite schools with decades of reputation of delivering great service and education have to face extreme levels of bureaucratic red-tapism. Sachin Tendulkar's school Shardashram Vidyamandir wanted to amend affiliation board from SSC to ICSE for Class 1 to Class IV and also wanted to change its name. Both the requests were dismissed by BMC officials stating that it has given NOC for SSC board till 2020 so it must continue with the same.

If this is the condition for established players who can be treated in such a manner by a municipal corporation, one can imagine what effect they will have on genuine players willing to enter the field. The regulations can induce bouts of trauma into even the most spirited of edupreneurs.

The language of the RTE Act and other rules indicates that the State is more concerned with reigning in the growth of private schools than facilitating right to education for everyone in reality.

While the regulations provide for elaborate monetary punishments which can even lead to closure of the school for not getting the recognition, there is hardly anything about the government's laxity in giving the certificates. The Haryana government is yet to grant recognition for around 3,200 private schools operating since 2003 in the state. Without recognition they can't even apply to the Haryana board for affiliation. Wonder why no act penalises the government, say Rs 10,000 per day per school, for each day's delay in granting recognition (or rejecting it as the case may be)? Even if these schools are given recognition, it will only be for a year. The situation is similar in Odisha and Kerala too. The future of thousands of schools in the country, year after year, depends on government's arbitrary decisions.

Also, the government can announce any new set of arbitrary conditions as the Uttar Pradesh government did recently when it made it mandatory for all schools to install CCTVs and biometric machines for attendance to seek recognition from the UP board.

And if the schools protest, the government can pass an order ruling that agitating against the government can lead to withdrawal of recognition as the Chandigarh education department did this year.

Such a regime is bad enough for any business. It's disastrous and suicidal to have it in private education sector which is the only hope left for the lower middle class and poor to climb up the social and economic ladder. Every day we continue with this system, we are inflicting great damage to the students from the lower strata of our populace who are highly disproportionately enrolled in the failed government schools. In its zeal to put a leash on private schools in the name of curbing profiteering, what the government has achieved is monopoly of those who are now experts at gaming the system through underhanded ways and means. The genuine educationists and philanthropists dare not enter the market.

What can the Modi government do? For starters, it can launch national 'ease of opening and running a school' rankings. Second, it can reform the norms and procedures needed for recognition mentioned in the schedule at the back of the RTE Act. It can be done by a simple government notification as section 20 of the act mandates. There is no need for ratification by the Parliament.

To realise the goal of universal quality education, which is affordable too, the state must facilitate proliferation of private schools leading to competition. This will do more to curb profiteering than any fee regulation act ever could."

As the monsoon is not far away, local people allege the school is flirting with danger and risking the lives of its students by operating in a high-risk flood zone.

""The school is situated at the junction where an outlet channel of the Chembarambakkam lake and the Adyar river meet. This means if water is released from the lake, the school will be the first building to be hit,"" said O Udayakumar, a resident of Thiruneermalai.

According to locals, the entire area right upto the base of the nearby hill, which is, at least, one km from the school, was submerged in water upto the first floor of several buildings during the 2015 floods.

This means a repeat could completely submerge the school which is just a stone's throw away from the Adyar river and the Chembarambakkam water channel.

Interestingly, the school seems to have sacrificed 'safety for the aesthetics'.

The school buildings have been constructed right next to the river bank instead of the other extremity, which would allow some breathing space in case of emergency, though disallowing the picturesque view it boasts of now.

Though construction works were completed last year, this primary school began functioning only two months ago with a strength of 50 students and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education.

When Express contacted the school's management over the issue, they downplayed the risks the school faces from flooding. ""We have raised the floor two metres and will build a four-metre compound wall,"" said an official, claiming the school's basement has been sealed as a safety measure.

When he did not return home till late into the night, his family launched a search.

In the meantime, the family got a call from the mobile of the abducted principal. An unknown person was speaking and he told the family that the principal was abducted and he would be killed if they did not pay a ransom of Rs 2 lakh for securing his release.

The principal's family, in a state of shock and panic, rushed to Badgaon Police Station to lodge an FIR after receiving the ransom call. As per SHO Sanjeev Kumar, the mobile number was put on electronic surveillance and a search operation was immediately launched. The location of the mobile number was traced to Monga jungles on Muzaffarnagar-Saharanpur border, said the SHO. He added that the police party deputed to search the abducted principal stumbled upon his bullet-riddled body from the same location on as early as 4 am on Friday. While the police sent the principal's body for post-mortem examination, they recovered three motorbikes-two of abductors and one of principal - from the spot.

However, the cops were wondering why the perpetrators did not wait for ransom and killed the principal within six hours of making the call to his family. ""Possibly, the principal had recognised the abductors who could be from the same village or his acquaintances,"" said a senior police official of the district.

Meanwhile, the police had asked the RTO to furnish details of the owner of two mobikes recovered from the site. The SHO claimed that probe was on into all possible aspects of the killing apart from murder for ransom"

On Sunday, the victim K Krithiga (28), teacher in a private school, has sustained labour pain. However, she was not rushed to any of the hospitals over there. With love for natural medicine, Krithiga's husband Karthikeyan and their friends Praveen and Lavanya have assisted the pregnant women in giving birth in a natural way at their home.

Nevertheless, none of the three persons was medically qualified. ""All the three have only learnt it by watching videos in YouTube,"" said a police official. According to sources, on Sunday after delivering a baby, Krithiga went unconscious as she lost lot of blood in the placental bleed. Soon she was rushed to a private hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead.

The incident became known only after they took the body to Tirupur Government Hospital, where the doctors sought for a medical certificate from them. As the family members did not have any medical certificate, they lodged a formal complaint in the Nallur police, who have filed a case of suspicious death and are probing into the matter.

The incident has come as a shock to the health officials as there were no records that Krithiga is pregnant. ""She has not consulted the doctor, right from the time of pregnancy. We have only the details of her first pregnancy,"" a health department official said.

However, we have asked the details about her to her family members. Meanwhile, Reproductive and Child Health Commissioner Darez Ahammed has asked for a detail inquiry report in this regard.

If implemented, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights' (NCPCR) recommendation that annual fee hikes by private, unaided schools be capped at 10% of existing fees, will severely impair education in the country. As per a recent report in The Hindustan Times, the NCPCR's draft fee-hike regulation -- to be submitted to the Union HRD ministry -- will feature a fee-formula as punitive measures for violating the cap. To be sure, there have been examples of arbitrary fee hikes, by up to 40% in some cases in Delhi and Mumbai. Though regulation of school fees is a state subject -- indeed, states like Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and most recently, Uttar Pradesh have brought in legislation to regulate private school fees -- there has been a voluble demand for a central regulation on the same. But, a summary fee-hike yoke is akin to burning down the house to kill a few rats. NCPCR, and the government, will do well to keep in mind that private school fees (and hikes) may not be a barrier for expanding education's reach in the country as much as the quality of education in government schools.

The poorer learning outcomes of government school students vis-a-vis their private school peers -- ASER reports over the years have highlighted this -- should reveal the the rot in government schools. But, if that doesn't depict how acute the problem is, the fact that, between 2010-11 and 2014-15, enrolment in government schools fell by 11.1 million students while that in private schools grew by 16 million, as a 2017 analysis of the government-compiled District Information System for Education (DISE) data by Geeta Kingdon of University of London shows, should. As per Kingdon, private schools cater for 49% of urban and 21% of rural primary students -- private, unaided schools constitute 24% of all schools, catering for 38% of school students. The strong trend of preference for private schools is also reflected in ASER data over the years.

Given how ASER focuses on rural India, where poor households are concentrated, it means concerns over quality of education are outweighing any pinch from fees, real or perceived. The preference in urban areas is thus likely to be much higher. Beyond the quality factor, the Kingdon study also reveals, using DISE data for 2010-11-2014-15, that the modal private unaided school fee per student was Rs 500 per month in urban areas whereas it was Rs 275 in rural areas. The all-India average worked out was Rs 417 per month. Given this is half of what the government spent -- Rs 960 per month -- on each student in government-funded schools (government and government-aided) in 20 major states, in 2014-15, the majority of private, unaided schools are delivering incomparable value. What's more, Kingdon found that 70-85% of the students in private schools were paying a monthly fee of less than Rs 500 in poor states like Bihar, Odisha, MP, Rajasthan and UP.

To be sure, an analysis of NSS (2014) data by Rohan Joshi and Shristi Kumar of Centre for Civil Society shows that household with children enrolled in private schools spent more (Rs 9,500 per month) than those that had children enrolled in government schools (Rs 6,000). However, families -- both urban and rural -- in poorer states were spending much lower than families in richer states. This shows that there has been an explosion of budget private schools in the country that are filling the gap left by government schools. Increasing the reach of affordable education, thus, depends less on capping private school fees than on improving the quality of government school education. If the government can't do that, then it should simply give households a cash-support for children's education."

The DC had told us that he would look into the matter and in case schools don't hear from the DC's office by June 15, we are to assume that they are fake.""

Rule 134A of the Haryana School Education Rules makes it mandatory for private schools to reserve 10% seats for meritorious students belonging to the EWS category. Schools are supposed to charge fee from these students at the same rate as charged in government schools.

When approached by TOI, DC Vinay Pratap Singh said, ""I have asked the district elementary education officer to look into the matter."""

Continuing its consultation with private school managements on regulating fees, the Gujarat government on Thursday said it did not agree with suggestion that it follow the Uttar Pradesh model. The Uttar Pradesh government had recently passed an ordinance towards regulating private school fees.

""The management representatives of self-financed schools had suggested following the Uttar Pradesh's fee regulation rules where it states that the existing fee of schools should remain as it is and on this there should be an annual seven per cent hike.

Chudasama said that the existing fee charged by the private schools was high, which was the entire premise of enforcing the Gujarat Self Financed Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017. The private school managements also suggested charging co-curricular activities.

""We suggested that these activities be considered integral part of the school and compulsory. This should not be optional. Thus, making the fee charged for these activities inclusive of the school fee and not additional,"" said Gujarat Self Financed School Management Federation general Secretary Bharat Gajipara, adding that another suggestion was to keep 15 per cent of the school fund reserved for development. The government will soon meet parents to discuss the issue, likely in a week.

After a report in Pune Newsline highlighted how the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) was indulging discriminatory practice vis-a-vis cash awards to SSC students from civic schools and private schools, the civic administration on Wednesday decided to tweak the rule and increase the prize money for meritorious students from private schools. Hundreds of meritorious students from private schools are expected to benefit from the move as now they will receive Rs one lakh instead of Rs 15,000, which was decided earlier.

On June 9, Pune Newsline had highlighted the fact that 18 PCMC-run school students who secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will get Rs one lakh cash reward while private school students within PCMC limits will get only Rs 15,000, a practice in force for past few years.

Civic activists had called for an end to this discriminatory practice. Taking note of the report, Pimpri-Chinchwad BJP president Laxman Jagtap, MLA had urged the civic administration and the standing committee to provide justice to private school students. As a result, a meeting by the standing committee was held on June 5, where it was announced that students from private schools who come under the below poverty line and have secured more than 90 per cent marks in SSC exams this year will also get Rs one lakh cash reward.

However, BJP leaders like city general secretary Sarang Kamtekar and PCMC House leader Eknath Pawar said they were in favour rewarding meritorious SSC students from economically weaker sections. ""PCMC should honour students who come from poor sections of the society and have secured more than 90 per cent marks. Like students who live in one room chawls, sons and daughters of autorickshaw drives and vegetable vendors,"" he said. Pawar said he too would take up the issue with the Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar.

When contacted, Hardikar said the idea was good and he would work out the budget for it. ""We will have to see how many students fall in the category and whether we are in a position to provide the funds. But the idea is good...we need to honour the poor and meritorious students,"" he said.

According to PCMC officials, last year over 1100 students from private schools had secured more than 90 per cent marks. ""These students included the poor as well as the rich,"" he said, adding that the figure of EWS students would be in the range of around 400.

A pimp, apparently husband of a former police clerk, and one of his accomplices are still at large, said police.

Preliminary probe revealed the music teacher on Sunday called up Jitender Parwana, the pimp, whom he had known since 2010, to fix a meeting with a call girl. Parwana shared with the teacher the mobile number of a woman.

Accordingly, the teacher called the woman, who asked him to share his photo on WhatsApp and fixed a 'deal' for Rs 2,000.She then asked him to come to her third-floor flat at a residential society on Basai Road.

When the teacher reached there around 11.15am, the woman claimed she was pregnant and thus sent him to another woman. The second woman, suspected to be the kingpin, subsequently sent the teacher to another woman. But as he went to meet the third woman inside a room (in the same flat), a few people alleged that he was trying to rape her.

""Parwana, Rakesh and Rahul, along with the two women, barged into the room and threatened to call police and frame me in a case. They asked me to cough up Rs 2 lakh and snatched my motorcycle key, Aadhaar card and driving licence. In the meantime, two men in police uniform reached the spot and warned me of action if I did not pay the money,"" the teacher later told police.

The teacher asked them to send someone with him to his home and promised to pay the money there. But instead of going home, he, accompanied by Rakesh, went to his politician uncle's house. The teacher confided everything in his uncle and sought his help. The uncle then called police.

While a team went straight to the Basai Road flat and nabbed the three women, another team reached the uncle's house and picked up Rakesh.

Based on the teacher's complaint, an FIR was filed against the six people under sections 323 (causing hurt), 342 (wrongful confinement), 389 (putting person in fear for extortion), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and various sections of the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act at Sector 9A police station.

This decision was taken during a meeting attended by several private school managements' associations on Friday.

D. Shashi Kumar, general secretary of the Associated Managements' of Primary and Secondary Schools in Karnataka, said the regulatory body will look into various issues such as exorbitant fee hikes by school managements and implementation of Kannada as the first or second language as mandated in the Kannada Language Learning Act 2016.

As many as 7,000 schools are under the umbrella of four private school associations in the State.

Association members will lodge a complaint with the officials of the Department of Public Instruction against erring school managements.

""In many instances, parents do not come forward to lodge complaints as they feel their child will be targeted. This move is to ensure that complaints reach the Education Department,"" a member of the management of a school said.

According to Mr. Kumar, the associations will also visit schools and ensure that the fee structure is displayed on the notice board as per the rules. ""Another area of concern is that many school managements are collecting excess fees from parents for books and uniforms. While collecting around ₹8,000 to ₹10,000 is acceptable, they should be penalised for anything more than this,"" he said.

The Commission, in its order, stated that the school had failed 'in its basic duty of giving opportunity to each and every child to not only excel in academics but also in co-curricular activities'. It directed the management to remove a clause in the school diary, which insisted that students had to wear shoes of a particular brand, and noted that parents should be free to buy books from any source. The school has also been forbidden from withholding mark cards, forcing children to take the competitive international exam or charging for annual functions.

It has also issued a warning that as long as children are in school or on a field trip, their safety is the responsibility of the school.

There's something rotten in the state of medical education and care in the country, stemming from a deep deficiency of emotional intelligence (EI) among medical students, the survey, conducted by researchers Subhashini Sundararajan and Dr. Vijayaprasad Gopichandran from Chennai's ESIC Medical College & PGIMSR, found.

Published in the journal BMC Medical Education, the survey of 207 medical students found that those who came from government schools consistently had greater emotional intelligence than those from private schools, something Gopichandran had observed as a teacher at ESIC.

Students on an average scored 107.58 out of a maximum score of 160 for EI, with government school students consistently scoring more. The study found that factors like age, gender, urban/rural nativity did not have as significant an impact on the scores, as much as schooling did.

The survey held the ""collectivist social setting"" of government schools and the stress on individualism in private schools responsible for this.

""Government schools across the country suffer from resource deprivation and students have really struggled. Their learning ends up happening in a collective, collaborative kind of manner, "" Gopichandran elaborated on how such a survey could have similar results all over

India.

""Kids from the best private schools have trouble adapting to a medical college, and in coping with how difficult their course is, because they're not comfortable studying collectively,"" he added. Students from government schools band together more easily, sharing notes and the burden of work, and offering help, while private school kids are mostly seen trying to study on their own with earphones on.

This, he pointed out, has become more noticeable post the NEET exam, with dramatically reduced the number of students from government schools entering medical colleges.

Such behaviour may be indicative of how students interact with patients once they start practicing medicine. The inability to listen to a patient has damaged the trust implicit between the doctor and the patient. Previous studies, said Gopichandran, showed that

if a patient is allowed to talk uninterrupted for two minutes, it dramatically reduces the overall time needed to give a correct diagnosis.

""Emotional intelligence does not take time,"" he said refuting arguments that doctors in India's government hospitals don't have the time to emotionally invest in patients. ""It is a matter of a couple of minutes, of the correct body language, the ability to listen, a simple hand on the patient's shoulder,"" he said, drawing from his own practice and from that of his mentors during his student days.

Unfortunately, students now don't get to interact with such doctors. They're few and far in between and students mostly learn from the colder behaviour of their own teachers.

""The rise of specialty and super specialty practices has meant that there are very fewer general physicians practicing ethical medicine. Patients aren't seen as whole people but as organs,"" said Gopichandran. ""I can't blame the students,"" he added, ""they're responding

to a market that only rewards those with most degrees.""

As his survey pointed out, private school students were deeply uncomfortable with getting to know their patients fearing their objectivity would be lost. They also thought of anger and a paternalistic attitude towards patients as necessary tools to make them stick to treatment regimes.

In such cases, the doctor and the patient tend to get trapped in a vicious cycle of diminishing trust, each responding negatively to the other. As the survey pointed out, this has led to a rush of violent attacks on doctors by patients and their attendants in the past few years.

However, ""emotional intelligence is a cognitive process,"" Gopichandran told News18, adding that it can be taught, something he himself learnt from researchers at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences who are teaching EI to policemen.

On the basis of this survey, Gopichandran and Sundarajan, who is his student as well has the lead author, are preparing a policy brief for the National Medical Council (NMC), to incorporate EI into medical training. Not as a separate lecture, he said, but as part of every course and for every teacher to impart.

""There has to be a focus on primary healthcare and on pushing students to explore medicine instead of fast-tracking their careers to corporate hospital jobs."" Gopichandran said. Lamenting that there is no joy left in medicine anymore, the researcher stressed that such attitudes needed changing."
