The Gujarat education department has ordered all districts to collect information on government school teachers who have been on leave for more than one year.

The exercise is aimed at exposing the lack of regulation on teachers' absenteeism from government schools. Parents have, for some time been, citing teachers' long absence from schools as on of the major reasons for the poor results of government schools.

The matter of teachers' long absence was first raised by Gujarat Primary Teachers' Association during the executive committee meeting of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) held on November 29 in Gandhinagar.

Following this, the Director Primary Education M I Joshi November 30 issued a circular to all District Primary Education Officers (DPEOs) and administrative officers (AO) seeking information from across the state before December 6.

For years, many teaching posts in remote districts of Kutch, Panchmahal and Banaskantha have remained vacant. To tackle the issue of vacant teaching posts, the Gujarat government, in the past, had made online applications for transfers mandatory in order to ward off ""pressures"" for preferred locations. The system sought to introduce transparency. However, the government was flooded with applicants seeking postings to their home districts. In spite of resorting to biometric attendance system for teachers, the state Education Department struggles to check the alarming absenteeism of teachers. While the government announces one scheme after another to improve education standards and check drop-out rates, this is one area where the government needs to act.

""It has been brought to the notice that teachers in several districts have remained absent for a long time. Because of this, it has adverse effects on students' education as the position cannot be filled by either a transfer or new appointment. This is a very serious issue. So, compile the information of all those teachers in your district who are absent for more than a year before December 6,"" the circular stated.

As per the rules, a new teacher cannot be appointed or the teacher cannot be transferred till the teacher is on leave, as in the teacher's absence the post is not vacant.

""There are teachers, around 10 in Jamnagar alone like one in Lalpur taluka and the other in Jamnagar, where teachers have been absent for the last three to four years. It has been a long time since they left for abroad,"" said Digvijaysinh Jadeja, president of Gujarat Primary Teachers' Association, who had raised the issue at the meeting.

Notices have been served to some of the teachers whose absence was brought to the notice of their respective district education officers.

According to rules, a notice seeking an explanation for the absence of a teacher is served thrice before passing an order of either his suspension or dismissal.

This is the first time that such a data collection drive is taking place in the state.

""There is no preliminary data of such teachers since we have never collected one before. This is the first time. We want to verify the claims made by the association regarding teachers' long absence,"" director of Primary Education M I Joshi said.

There are around 1.90 lakh government primary school teachers in the state, constituting a 60:40 ratio of female and male teachers.

With a larger proportion of women teachers, their male counterparts have been complaining of teaching hours being affected as female teachers also avail long maternity leaves. This was also reflected in the draft National Education

Policy (NEP) report which was prepared by the state education department in 2015 and submitted to the Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD).

Among major reasons for poor education quality, the report cited 'majority percentage of female teachers in government schools result in higher irregular classes as they go on long maternity leave and no arrangement for reserved faculty'."

Teachers have to inform child welfare panel","The New Indian Express",FALSE,"BENGALURU: To prevent child marriages, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) has come out with an initiative involving the school teacher. If the child remains absent for a considerable number of days on the trot without prior intimation, the teachers concerned will have to inform the local Child Welfare Committee (CWC). The principal concerned will be held responsible if the teachers fail to inform the CWC about students staying away from school for long.

A senior official from the Department of Public Instruction said that in many cases, teachers and headmasters know about a child getting married, but do not inform the officials concerned -- either due to negligence or out of helplessness. ""By making them accountable, we hope they will inform the CWC and try to prevent child marriages,'' the official said.

A memo issued by Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan planning director, which is available with The New Indian Express, says the CWC gets many cases related to child marriages as well as missing children complaints.

In Karnataka, there has been a decrease in girl child's attendance. The school management probes the absence of the girl children but drops it after not making any headway. And by the time it reaches the CWC, it is too late.

With the latest initiative, children can be tracked in time. Apart from CWC officials, teachers will also have to report the cases of children staying away from schools for many consecutive days to the Block Education Officer and District Deputy Director (administration).

Vasudeva Sharma, former CWC member and director of Child Rights Trust, said that although child marriage is rampant in Karnataka, most of the cases go unreported. ""Usually, if a child is getting married, parents stop sending the child to school 10-15 days before the wedding day. In such cases, teachers should find out the whereabouts of the child. If they are unable to trace the child and smell something wrong, they can approach the CWC,'' he said.

In 2017, Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (KSCPCR) had released a statement saying that the state accounts for 23.2 per cent of child marriages in India. The practice is prevalent in almost all the districts of the state, especially North Karnataka districts, including Yadgir, Belagavi, Bagalkote, Ballari and Kalaburagi."

The NGO named various schools and their missing teachers who were allegedly neglecting their duty to students.

""According to residents of various localities, these teachers never attend school and this has been affecting the students even as their annual exams approach. We are alarmed at the development and seriously concerned about the fate of the school-going children,"" said president of the unit, Greneth Sangma.

The NGO condemned the neglect while also seeking legal action against the said teacher for depriving the poor and innocent villagers and earning their wages without attending their official duties.

The NGO named one teacher of Gara Samka who allegedly attended school only 3 times a year. ""As of last year he completely failed to attend his official duties - no class-work activities, and exams were never conducted,"" added Greneth.

They further asserted that only 3 schools were actively and properly functioning, i.e. Balkal A'sim Govt. LP School, Gara Songgital Govt. LP School and Mindikgre Govt. LP School.

""Teachers of those schools are highly appreciated by the community of the region"" added the GSU president.

They further named few more teachers who were guilty of the same neglect in the Chokpot region.

""They are earning handsome salaries and sending their own children for good education in urban areas, while on the other hand, depriving the children of the poor and innocent of their good education,"" he added while further condemning them along with government authorities who support them.

""As per sources, these school authorities never inspect nor examine the functioning of rural schools. It shows the incapability of the authority in appointing such incompetent school teachers,"" alleged Greneth.

The NGO demanded the DSEL to immediately terminate the services of those teachers after an investigation into their acts of neglect.

""A temporary termination or holding up pay is not a solution in front of the cries of those communities. We strongly demand justice and fair action from the authority,"" he stated asking for authorities to undertake surprise inspection of all government LP schools.

The NGO also condemned the SDSEOs, school inspectors, CRC, and head-cum-secretary of each Govt. LP Schools for not fulfilling the standard of the education.

""They take the excuse of law and order and are not attending their official duties properly as required by the norms. Many officers are not inspecting the functioning of the schools. They never inquire or visit the remote rural schools of how they are managing and operating,"" the NGO asserted.

Further on the issue of head-cum-secretary post holders in their respective schools and circles, the NGO alleged that they were mostly neglecting their duties in many parts of the Garo Hills.

""For this reason, we strongly condemn the head-cum-secretary system and demand removal of dual post-holders as such for better functioning of the Govt. LP Schools,"" they added."

Buckling under pressure, the Rajasthan government has scrapped orders by two district administrations telling teachers they will lose pay if they do not attend a Teachers' Day function in Jaipur which will be addressed by Chief Minister Vasundhra Raje.

The orders had also forbid them from wearing black belts, shoes, t-shirts and socks. After drawing widespread criticism from the opposition and the teaching fraternity, these restrictions were removed in a fresh order.

Director Secondary Education Department Nathmal Didel said the orders were not issued by the directorate and action would be taken against the District Education Officers (DEOs) in Bharatpur and Hanumangarh districts who released the orders on August 29 and 30 ""arbitrarily"".

He said the orders were withdrawn and fresh orders issued in which the salary deduction clause was removed.

He said those who have disabilities or are suffering from diseases or have any other emergency can take permission for leave from respective authorities.

He said revised orders were issued for attending the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur in ""specified clothes"", he said.

He did not elaborate what he meant by specified clothes.

The old orders made it compulsory for all government teachers, who were appointed after December 13, 2013, to attend the state-level Teachers' Day celebration in Jaipur on September 5. In case they were absent, they would suffer a loss of one-day salary, they said.

Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje had taken oath on December 13, 2013 and this cut-off date ensured that teachers, who were appointed after the BJP government came to power, attended the programme.

The old order also prohibited teachers from wearing black belt, shoes, T-shirt, socks during the celebration.

The opposition had slammed the move, saying there seemed no logic in making it compulsory for teachers to attend the celebration and it was merely an attempt to gather a crowd in rallies.

State Congress president Sachin Pilot claimed it was a desperate attempt of the BJP government to gather crowd.

""How can the government differentiate between teachers who got jobs during the Congress regime or the BJP's earlier regimes,"" he asked.

President of All Rajasthan School Teachers' Union, Ramkrishna Agarwal said the clauses of salary deduction and of forbidding teachers from wearing black were akin to an ""undeclared emergency"".

Nearly 63,000 teachers were newly appointed in the state under the BJP government and nearly 50,000 teachers were expected to take part in the celebrations.

President of Berozgar Shikshak Sangathan, Upen Yadav said the government would pay Rs 8.51 crore as allowance to teachers to take part in the celebration but had the government spent these funds judiciously in the last four years, many teachers could have been appointed."
