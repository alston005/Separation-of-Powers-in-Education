Balamurali Krishna Interview: 'Most of my music happens in my mind'","The Indian Express",FALSE,"In the third edition of the Indian Express Margazhi special, we feature Chennai-based carnatic musician Kunnakkudi M. Balamurali Krishna

Kunnakkudi Balamurali Krishna is one of the most thrilling carnatic musicians of the younger generation. A regular primetime singer in Chennai's leading Sabhas during the Margazhi season and a top billing artiste in the carnatic circuit elsewhere, he has a steadily rising following among music lovers.

In the contemporary classical music scene, particularly among the younger generation, where it's hard to locate the qualities that distinguish one singer from another, Balamurali Krishna stands out for his energy, out-of-the-box thinking and artistic enterprise. Although it's very difficult to suggest a pecking order among the younger lot, given their musical legacy, skills and even unconventional attitudes, Balamurali Krishna is certainly one of the most energetic and innovative on stage, whether he is going solo with his elaborate alapanas, playing musical games with his Pallavis or singing in unison with his ensemble.

PART 1: The Sanjay Subrahmanyan interview: 'When I am on the stage I am on a high. It's worse than any other form of addiction'

Trained both in Mridangam and vocal music by legendary Karaikudi Mani and PS Narayanaswamy respectively, Balamurali Krishna scores well in laya, the intricate use of gamakas and other voice techniques including tans employed by Hindustani musicians, reaching higher octaves and also in soulful singing. He is a thinking musician, who has also been influenced by the ""problem-solving"" approach of the past masters. The most interesting aspect of his music, however, is the unique emphasis he gives to the role of his mind in shaping his art.

We are in the last phase of the Margazhi in Chennai and you have been one of the busiest vocalists this season with back-to-back concerts. How are Margazhi concerts different from others?

Advertising

It's a season that all carnatic musicians look forward to, a culmination of the last 11 months of one's music. Although we do perform in the city during the rest of the year, this is extra alluring, especially for musicians in Chennai like me who started learning at a very young age because we grew up listening to concerts in the season. As youngsters, we enjoyed the energy and the electricity. It was always special listening to the heroes we worshipped.

As a child, my main idols were Karaikudi Mani sir (famous mridangist) and PS Narayanaswamy mama, whom I still worship. I was fortunate enough to eventually learn from both of them. I started learning from Mani sir at the age of 13. My father used to take me to Shastri Hall to listen to concerts ever since I was five. Even today I have those thrilling memories. I hero worshipped many musicians to the extent of keeping their photos in my wallet. For people like me, Margazhi was special because you got to see your idols not on a monthly basis, but on a daily basis, and also because you could hear them present new things

What has been your special this season?

I usually try out new ragas. I am more into raga singing. I would like to explore them in detail. In a regular two-hour concert, my main raga should be at least 15-20 minutes. If it's less than that, there will be a specific reason.

Even if it's a light raga?

Yes. I have sung Subhapantuvarali for 25 minutes, Hamir Kalyani for 20 minutes, Lalitha for 15 minutes and so on. Elaborate raga singing is something I work on.

In terms of what's new, it's also about the Pallavis that I sing and the talas that I choose. My approach towards Pallavis has been changing radically for the last five years. In fact, so many things have been changing in the recent years - there are a lot of new ways to approach a raga.

Your Mohanam (at a concert) yesterday sounded so different

This is something I learned by listening to the music of masters such as Semmangudi, MD Ramanathan (MDR), GN Balasubramaniam (GNB) and so on. They all started the ragam in a similar way, their gamakas were the same, they sang in a sampradayik (traditional) style as we know it. Or their approach to music was what we think as sampradayik. However, they were all unique and different from each other.

The main basis of a raga is usually the Trinity compositions. So, it's always going to sound sampradayik (traditional) for us. These days we try a lot of new things. The approach now is to have more variety than going in depth whereas the masters had explored the depth. In their time, they were the innovators and they also sang a lot of compositions that were contemporary then. For instance, MDR composed a lot of songs, they were indepth singers, but now people are trying more outlandish things. But if somebody could sing ragas in a sampradayik style without sounding similar, also not by trying anything ""eccentric"" why can't we do it now? How did the masters do it? That's how I started exploring ragas. It's about understanding how much this music can offer you without ever going beyond certain boundaries.

The musician can choose the boundaries, I mean the approach towards a raga. I will have a boundary for myself. Take for instance Mohanam. The base will still be Mohanam, it will have five swaras, but then I can do whatever I want to with them.

How much of is it preplanned and how much happens spontaneously on stage?

With respect to manodharma (improvisation) singing. I do most of it on stage. Preparation for me is thinking. The only practice I do is warm up and voice exercises. Even on concert days.

PART 2: The Saketharaman interview: 'Bhava is very important in music. My ultimate goal is spiritual'

But what about your regular practice?

I do it all in the mind.

That's all? Isn't it risky because you may get ideas, but you may not be sure if you have the skills to execute them on stage.

For that, you need to know your voice. In terms of this regular practice that you mentioned, I did all that when I was younger. For 13-14 years of my initial learning, I used to practice four hours every day. And it was rigorous. And there were many ways of doing it. For instance, my father used to record AIR concerts that were broadcast at odd hours and make me listen to them and practise.

Very interesting that your practice happens in the mind.

Yeah, probably in the last 13 years.

So you don't feel the need to sing out a raga aloud or some difficult phrases at home?

For me, every moment I am awake, something (music) is going on in my mind. It's happening even now as we are talking to you. I just got used to it. I can sing on stage anything I want to because both my mind and voice are prepared. As I told you, I do train my voice along with my mind.

But don't you have to physically practise to learn a new raga, for instance?

I recently sang Vanaspathi. I knew the song that was composed in that raga for 13 years, but never sang the raga. Then, I fell in love with that raga, started thinking about it and sang it. Till singing on stage, I didn't practise it physically. The whole practice - 100 per cent - of that raga alapana was in my mind.

Wow, it's amazing that this is also possible!

I had a throat surgery a few years ago and a lot of thinking happened after that, during the therapy sessions. Till my surgery, I thought only about content on stage and I had a basic knowledge about how my voice should sound. I indeed used to feel that my voice sounded different in different concert halls of Chennai, but I had no clue why it happened - I mean the importance of voice.

After my surgery in the US, I had voice therapists both there and in Chennai, but both didn't know Carnatic music and its demands and hence I had to think about it myself. What makes Carnatic music different from other forms of music, particularly Western, is the azhutham and the gamakas. They are the base for Carnatic music. That's what makes Carnatic music sound so different. The number of gamakas, the oscillations, the number of different ways of touching a swara etc.

For those demands, there was no answer from my therapists. I plainly asked one of my therapists - this is the line I want to sing, this is how I want to sing, can you suggest a really good voice technique for me not to strain my voice, but still sing? For instance, I want to sing something full-throated from my chest, that's when I feel it, that's when I feel my audience will be elated. Give me a technique that will have a minimal effort on my voice. For a raga like mukhari it has have more azhutham.

But they had no answers and they couldn't have answers because most of their theories were based on western vocalisation. Unfortunately for Carnatic music, there were no voice trainers then (I think there are a few now). We have music trainers, content trainers, but no voice trainers. For western music, more than the content, they train the voice.

But in our music, it's a little bit of notation and 95 per cent internalising what goes inside that. And that experience and my post-surgery musings gave me a lot of insights into voice. That also made me understand why I sounded different in different concert halls. Therefore, I think a lot now, I sing differently and I am open to a lot of new things.

Do you listen to other forms of music

A lot of Hindustani than western classical

You employ a lot of express tans, like you did in the concert yesterday

Yes I do.

You are like guns blazing.

I practise those techniques a lot. I found a way to practise them myself because there's nobody to train you like that here in Chennai. I have a number of inspirations such as the great maestro Bhimsen Joshi, Salamat Ali Khan, Bade Gulam Ali Khan and Amir Khan.

But More and more people are incorporating such elements into carnatic music now. Mostly in ragas borrowed from Hindustani.

For me, music is logic and logic is god and I have found a way to cultivate my voice towards that.

My guru PS Narayanaswamy was the best and he ensured that my basics were strong. As a teacher, he let us bloom and understood our thought processes. While learning and practising with him, the only thing he prevented us from doing were committing technical mistakes. He would always allow us to explore. He would sing in the class, he would sing neravals and swaras and they were great learning opportunities.

I have read that you and Abhishek Raghuram (another famous vocalist) were his students at the same period and he would allow you both to improvise in class. That he would be watching you and Abhishek doing improvised singing and would not intervene until there's a mistake

Yes, he would sing, we would sing; he would ask us to sing just one avarthanam without any breaks and we would try to sing for 15 minutes back and forth. He would sing something new every single time and we would start getting repetitive or frustrated. That would compel us to try out new things, but for both of us, we needed logic. With logic, it's hard to do, not to be repetitive. After about 15 times or so, he would smile and give us four swaras and ask us to sing with only those four. So you would start exploring within those four.

Just for swaras, no raga framework?

The tough part would be that he would ask us to do it in ragas such as Nayaki, Durbar, Kannada or Malavi. I would never forget Malavi. It was so tough.

PART 3: The Brindha Manickavasakan Interview: 'Involved singing is an uplifting magical experience'

That sounds very rigorous

It was really indeed rigorous and challenging, but enjoyable too. We had more energy and expectations from a class with our Guru than from a concert those days.

Your music is about extreme confidence, energy and power

What I was coming to earlier was that my fundamentals are strong because of my Guru. I also practised rigorously for years. So now, when I think of a raga, something that i have already sung, I am trying to understand the feel and how it would go. After that, it's just manodharma. Nowadays, it also depends on my mood on that day, with whom you are singing, which venue, how my voice is responding etc. That's how I go about exploring a raga these days. Sometimes, I have 15 minutes, sometimes 30 minutes and so on. That's why I am able to sing whatever comes to my mind. See, on 90 per cent of the occasions, I just go there and sing because I know that the base is going to be right.

Going to the upper octaves like you do could be tricky sometimes because you may not touch the notes you want to

This is one of the things I learned after my recovery. I was singing in madhyamashruthi and till then I wasn't able to explore beyond madhyamam and panchamam. Once in a concert I was singing Kamboji and that day my voice was not good with even the high Ga getting tough. I didn't understand why, but now I can tell you that it was because Kamboji needs more azhutham and power on Ga rather than a high Pa as you do in a raga like Kalyani. That's how the ragam goes. I didn't understand that because for me it was the logic of the ragam. This is what I meant when I said I never thought anything other than content till I had my surgery. It opened a lot of things to me - voice projection, the environment of the venue etc.

So, that day I finished Kamboji and couldn't sing in upper Ga. After it was over, I sang a song in madhyamashruthi and I suddenly realised that I could reach the higher notes while my mind was taking them as lower notes. It was because of my musical training. I realised that my voice was actually ready for those swaras and I consciously sang them thinking they were lower notes. It was all in the mind. You think you are at a lower note, but sing higher. Then I started consciously working on that. After a few months, it became very easy. Then I wanted to go there without ""pre-emption"" and after some time, I skipped the ""pre-emption"" and went to those notes directly. Now I do it easily. I always am open for some new adventure.

Don't you get scared about possible failure whenever you feel adventurous?

No, I just sing.

But what about Kritis, don't you practise them physically?

Of course I do. I do practise, I learn them well.

How long does it take?

Learning a kriti will take only an hour, but mastering will take a long time.

Seeing your skills in those kanakkus and korvai etc, I wonder if you studied maths and science

I studied commerce, but I love maths.

What's your take on the concert format that some people have a problem with?

Let me give you this analogy: you give kids some limited space and a few toys to play with. Initially, they will feel very limited with the choices they have and even get bored, but after a few days, the kids will make their own rules and make it complex with a number of possibilities with which they are not bored anymore. And that's how Carnatic music also is. The actual rules are much more complex than one thinks they are and they in fact offer immense scope to be creative. It's an inherent strength.

Does popular music, say film music, attract you?

No, I just listen to some of it, that's all. My music is all Carnatic and some Hindustani.

What makes you the happiest in a concert?

The first moment I feel happy is when the curtain rises. Right from the time I get dressed up for a concert, I get restless. The exhilarating feeling you get the moment you start singing is priceless.

What are your moments of euphoria in music?

Express Opinion Year of the farceBy Mrinal Pande May the game be with youBy MC Mary Kom

There are many things that make me ecstatic. The best I get is when I feel choked with emotions while singing. You are trained to be controlled and you don't explore on stage more than 70 per cent of what your voice is capable of, but you are still overcome by your own emotion of the raga. Sometimes it's not even a raga, but a song that does the trick - say Mayamma in Ahiri. With that song, I have gotten stuck because I was overcome by its emotion. Once I had to keep quiet after one avarthanam because I had to get out of the zone and compose myself. I value those moments the most. Even more than the euphoria, it's the excitement you get on stage. It's priceless. It means that you are being touched by music.

Every musician will go through this. When you sing, in your mind you hear the ""ultimateness"" about your singing. See, you have been hearing music for long, so when you sing a sangathi, in your mind you hear the best version of the sangathi that you think you are capable of singing. At some point in your singing career, that bubble breaks when you actually hear yourself sing it rather than your own imagination doing it. Often, after you sing a concert when you listen to the recording, you may not be satisfied because you haven't reached the ultimateness of your own singing that you had heard in your mind.

Once you reach the ultimate that you had in your mind, your ultimate itself will change. That's how you keep getting better and better.

Coming to Carnatic music as a career, isn't it a risky profession because of the limited market?

I grew up in a household with music and my father was a music teacher. Right from childhood, I wanted to do only music because that's what made me happy. By the time I was 13, I was pretty certain about that, nothing else gave me this pleasure. Unlike in any other career, classical art is not about commercial transaction, but the pleasure of doing it.

How much does the audience-response contribute to the success of your music?

I am certainly conscious of their responses, but often I am out of it and I am in my own zone.

Does it distract you?

Of course not; Instead, I love it. I get pumped up. It's a culmination of many things.

Sometimes something I do is the the ultimate for me, but not for them; and sometimes it may be great for them, but not for me. Sometimes I get surprised that they loved something when I least expected it.

Have you faced failures in the concert?

It happens all the time. Sometimes I am happy about my feeling, but not the way I sounded. Sometimes the voice and the tonal quality would have been very good, but my content wasn't good. Some times, I do discard a lot of my own ideas.

Your inspiration within carnatic music?

Nadaswaram is a huge inspiration for me, mainly their never-ending exploration of the ragas. When it's played during temple processions, there are rules that they have to keep playing the same raga till a certain part of the ritual is over. So they have to keep playing, which means they have to keep exploring without getting repetitive. And also there are specific ragas for specific days. That's how certain ragas get more scope when handled by Nadaswaram players. A lot of musicians started developing ragas only based on that - Nadaswaram is their base.

Rakthi Vs scale?

From a voice point of view, it's easier to sing scale ragas because the notes are plain. However, even in ragas with plain notes, it's the singer's job to give the rakthi.

I can give you an example. When i was young, I had heard the great musician RK Srikantan singing hamsadhwani. There's this particular gamaka that I had never heard in hamsadwhani which inherently has very little oscillation. My Guru, who was present with me at the concert, was also surprised and asked me, ""did you hear that?"" That's how great knowledgeable people add value. I have used that gamaka in my rendition of Vathapi (a popular composition in Hamswadhwani)

Evolution as a musician

What I would like is to get more soaked in the fundamentals of carnatic music so that the innovations are more original. That's the only thing I want to do. I am insisting that with my students as well.

You have mentioned to me that you are greatly influenced by MD Ramanathan. Why?

He was an unbelievable musician. The moment he opens his mouth, he is in perfect pitch and the precision with the gamakas and how he delineates a raga were stunning. He did what he did 40 years ago with no support of technology.

You use borrowed techniques such as tans in your music, particularly in non-Hindustani and heavy ragas.

Earlier I didn't know how to use those ornamentations, but now I do. Now, it has become more natural for me to sing those. I am not labouring them any more like I used to do. Earlier, I used to employ it only in Hindustani bhajans, but now it has become so natural to me that I have used it in Todi and Bhairavi as well.

Other than MDR, who are the masters who inspire(d) you?

My Guru PS Narayanaswamy, Semmangudi Srinivasa Iyer, TM Thyagarajan, and TN Seshagopalan. My Guru was like a ""model paper"". After he sang, there was nothing left.

Regarding Semmangudi, I get amazed the more I listen to him. He sounds simple and refreshing, but when I sit down to sing like him, I wouldn't be able to do even a fraction of what he did. As a young boy I had even cried being unable to repeat what he sang although he sounded simple. He was deceptive, his speed was deceptive. He would have more space between avarthanams than I have. There's some magic in his singing. A lot of problem-solving methods. The closest analogy would be like a defensive-looking straight drive by Sachin Tendulkar. It would look just like a nudge as if he was blocking the ball, but it would race to the boundary like a bullet. Complex things made look easy. Semmangudi was like that.

TM Thyagarajan, for me, was the father of modulation in carnatic music. The way he could push the limits. He had a very different thought process. Technically one of the most logical musicians. Very few people do a tightrope walk like him while singing a raga. Trying to repeat a sangathi sung by him is tricky because of his modulation. He may sound good and correct, but when we try to sing like him, we may go wrong.

As regards Seshagopalan, I don't think any musician after the 1980s hasn't been influenced by his thought process. He is a true force. His concert is like a treasure trove. Even a raga that he has sung umpteen times would sound new when you hear him sing again. He is just amazing.

Contemporary and young Carnatic musicians indulge in a lot of innovations now. Any thoughts on that?

There are many out-of-the-box things that are happening. In the olden days, ragamalika was an improvisation, now it's very common. Similarly, we do a lot with the pallavis, different talas, different nadais etc. In fact, everybody is trying something new. It's unbelievable. We have also been taking ideas from Hindustani, Western Classical, Persian music etc.

Have you done any crossover experiments?

Yes, I have had some gigs in the US. It may not always work for our vocalists with their instrumentalists because of issues such as pitch. I may not be able to match their pitch if their instrumentalists go beyond two and a half octaves. It works better for our instrumentalists though. If I were an instrumentalist, probably I could have done more.

I have noticed that you sing less number of tukdas (short popular pieces at the end of the concert). Why?

Because I sing ragas and don't stop (laughs)

Any favourite raga?

Varali. Also Shanmughapriya, Subhapantuvarali and Todi - because of my love for nadaswaram. I can sing any number of Todis

How do you memorise all these details, the repertoire, the notes, scales, emotions, specific gamakas with certain ragas and kritis etc?

In Carnatic music, you learn by looking at the face of the Guru, not notations. I do that with my students. Listening and learning directly from the face of the Guru improves your absorption. It's also accumulated knowledge. You never unlearn things you learn this way. They become part of you.

What's your process of trying out new ragas?

You have to get your fundamentals right to know how to approach a new raga. You learn a new raga by listening to compositions without which you are never going to sing. There are phrases within the song that you take up for raga singing. For instance, in his Harikamboji composition, Thyagaraja clearly shows - through a certain phrase - how to delineate it differently from Khamas. That phrase gives you the lead as to how to approach Harikamboji. Such knowledge gets accumulated over a period of time. So when you have a song in a new raga, analyse the song first, you get the raga. I may like a song, it will be running in my mind for some time, and at some stage I start thinking that I would sing it as a raga.

So have you sung even these new ragas with just mind-practice? Without singing at home?

Yes. It may look easy outwardly, but it's very tiring on the mind. Once you start thinking, you are always thinking about it and you cannot stop. But please note that even when I am saying that all my music is in my mind, if I sing the same raga five to six times in concerts over a period of a year or two, then my approach towards that raga itself will be completely different. What I am implying is that I do improve when I physically sing, but I can also sing without singing at home because I am sure of what I think. I recently sang a raga on stage that I had never attempted before, ever.

You have collaborated with Abhishek Raghuram. Do you discuss music with him?

We do, now and then. We would want to do concerts together only once or twice a year because we need time to plan together. Just because we learned together doesn't mean we can sing together without preparation. We have different styles of singing and that's what makes our combo interesting. Almost all the manodharma aspects in such gigs happen on the stage, but singing the compositions require coordination and practice together.

Is music as a career satisfying economically?

Class 10 students in Kashmir's Pulwama & Shopian districts excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days.

New Delhi: Community schooling and continuous efforts by the locals is what led to excellent Class 10 results in south Kashmir's Pulwama and Shopian districts, the most disturbed region in the Kashmir Valley last year, say local residents and students.

The Jammu and Kashmir State Board of School Education (JKBOSE) announced the Class 10 results for Kashmir division on Saturday, and Pulwama and Shopian districts in south Kashmir recorded the highest pass percentage. While Pulwama recorded a pass percentage of 84.5 per cent, the pass percentage in Shopian was 83 per cent. Both these figures are higher than that of Srinagar, which recorded a pass percentage of 81.9 per cent.

The overall pass percentage in Kashmir this year was 75.44, compared to 62.94 last year.

According to the state government data, in 2018, schools in Pulwama district were shut for 170 days and, in Shopian they were closed for 118 days by the administration due to fear of disturbance. This shutdown was apart from the number of regular holidays that the students got.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the HRD Ministry had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

While the district administration credited the government's efforts for the results, school teachers said it was largely because of the intervention by the local residents.

""Schools were shut down for most part of the academic year and there was no way they could have completed their syllabus. It was largely because the locals ran community schools for students in several parts of the districts, that they were able to study,"" said Masood Taing, a teacher at a government school in Shopian.

Community schools are like coaching classes, where a couple of teachers gather to teach students either at somebody's home or a community centre, depending on availability. There are more community schools in rural Kashmir than in urban areas.

""We used to study at home most of the time because schools were shut. We used to write down all the doubts and clarify them with our teachers when schools reopened. Community schools also shut down during curfew in the town, (but) they were mostly open in villages,"" said Abid Hassan, a student from Pulwama district who scored 88 per cent.

Reham Mir, who scored 90 per cent marks, also said he studied at home and with the help of a community school.

Malik Mohammad, a resident of Pulwama, praised the efforts of the students in south Kashmir.

""Schools were closed for more than five months in Pulwama district. How can one expect students to finish their syllabus? Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

Class X students in Pulwama & Shopian excelled with highest pass percentage, even though schools there were closed for more than 100 days

Despite all these odds they have managed to study and not just study, get excellent results. All of this is because they are self-motivated and get help from locals who run community schools,"" Mohammad said.

""Students from south Kashmir are traditionally known to be excellent in studies because they know that they will not get support from schools, so they have to be self-dependent,"" he added.

G.N. Itoo, director of school education, gave all the credit to students. ""Despite all the problems students have shown excellent results in Shopian and Pulwama. They are all very hard-working students,"" he said.

During the 2016 unrest in Kashmir following the killing of Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani, 32 school buildings were burnt and most of them were in south Kashmir. In 2017, the ministry of human resource development had devised a roadmap for Kashmir to improve the education scenario in the state. Construction of school buildings was also a part of the ministry's plan. However, no construction has happened so far in Pulwama and Shopian districts.

(i) A web portal called ShaGun(from the words Shaala and Gunvatta) which has two parts i.e., one is a Repository of good practices, photographs, videos, studies, newspaper articles etc on elementary education, State /UT wise has been developed. Its purpose is to showcase success stories and also to provide a platform for all stakeholders to learn from each other, and instill a positive competitive spirit among all the States and UTs.

The second part is the online monitoring module of Shagun which measures state-level performance and progress against key educational indicators which enables the Government of India and the State and UT Departments of education to conduct real-time assessments which normal paper-based monitoring mechanisms did not allow. Through Shagun, the data collection and reporting processes have been simplified; resulting in a totally transparent and efficient system.

In addition, an online Project Monitoring System (PMS) has been developed to monitor physical and financial progress of implementation of various components under Samagra Shiksha including appraisal of Annual Plans and issuing of sanctions etc.

(ii) In order to increase focus on quality of elementary education, the Central rules to the RTE Act, 2009 have been amended on 20 February, 2017 to include reference on class-wise, subject-wise Learning Outcomes. The Learning Outcomes for each class in Languages (Hindi, English and Urdu), Mathematics, Environmental Studies, Science and Social Science up to the elementary stage have, accordingly, been finalized and shared with all States and UTs. Learning

outcomes have been translated in different languages and serve as a benchmark for student's capabilities to be achieved in each subject & class.

(iii) Shaala Siddhi is a School Standards and Evaluation Framework, developed by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration (NUEPA), which enables the schools to self evaluate based on seven key domains.

(iv) The NCERT has developed a framework for Performance Indicators for Elementary School Teachers (PINDICS) and shared with the states. PINDICS is a framework for assessing teacher performance and providing constructive feedback for further improvement.

(v) National Achievement Surveys are carried out by National Council for Educational Research and Training to assess learning achievement of children in Classes - III, V, VIII, and X. The National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, was held on 13 November for assessing the competencies of children at the grade levels III, V and VIII covering 22 lakh students from 1.10 lakh schools in all 36 states and UTs. NAS (2017) was administered with districts as the unit of reporting in different subject areas such as languages, mathematics, EVS/Science and Social Sciences in the Government and Government aided schools. The competency based test was based on the Learning Outcomes which were recently incorporated in the Central Rules for RTE Act by the Government of India.

The National Achievement Survey for students of Class X was similarly, held on 5th February 2018, with a district level sampling framework covering nearly 15.5 lakh students using multiple test booklets in Mathematics, Modern Indian Languages, English, Sciences and Social Sciences. NAS district report cards have been shared with the States and UTs to help in identifying gaps at the district level. Subsequently, a framework of intervention has been developed and shared with States to improve the quality of learning in the schools.

Further, Central Government has taken the following initiatives for improving quality of education:

(i) Section 23(2) of the RTE Act has been amended to extend the period for training of untrained in-service elementary teachers to 31st March, 2019. As per above amendment, all untrained in-service teachers working in Government, Government aided, and Private un-aided schools should acquire minimum qualification as laid down by an academic authority, authorized by the Central Government, by 31st March, 2019. The National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has been entrusted to conduct this training through ODL (Open Distance Learning) mode. The online D.El.Ed. course has started from 3rd October, 2017. More than 13 Lakh teachers have joined these courses.

(ii) Further, the Department of School Education and Literacy has launched an Integrated Scheme for School Education-Samagra Shiksha, subsuming three erstwhile Centrally Sponsored Schemes of Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA), Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA) and Teacher Education (TE). With effect from 1st April, 2018. The new integrated scheme envisages school education as a continuum from pre-school to senior secondary level and aims to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education at all levels. The main objectives of the scheme are to provide quality education, enhancing learning outcomes of students, bridging social and gender gaps in school education, ensuring requisite infrastructure in schools, support to states in the implementation of RTE Act, 2009 and strengthening of teacher education institutions.

The Samagra Shiksha scheme focuses on improvement of quality of education by providing support for different interventions like; in-service training of teachers and schools heads, conduct of achievement surveys at National and State level, provision of textbooks as per Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, remedial teaching for academically weaker students, ICT and digital initiatives, vocational education, composite school grant to every school for providing a conducive learning environment has been increased and from this year provisions for library grants and grants for sports and physical education have also been introduced.

The Government has also launched Rashtriya Aavishkar Abhiyan (RAA) programme on 09.07.2015, to motivate and engage children of the age group from 6-18 years in Science, Mathematics and Technology through observation, experimentation, inference drawing, model building, etc. both through inside and outside classroom activities.

e PATHSHALA: a single point repository of e ­resources containing NCERT textbooks and various other learning resources has been developed for showcasing and disseminating all educational resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals, and a variety of other print and non-­print materials.

The Central Government, supports States and UTs on early grade reading, writing & comprehension, and early Mathematics programmes through a sub-programme namely 'Padhe Bharat Badhe Bharat' (PBBB) in foundational years of schooling.

(iii) MHRD, has launched a Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platform popularly known as SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active learning for Young Aspiring Minds) on 9 July, 2017. The portal is offering various online courses for school education and higher education. NCERT has been developing course modules for Massive Open and Online Course (MOOCs) for school education system in 12 subject areas (Accountancy, business studies, biology, chemistry, economic, history, geography, mathematics, physics, political science, psychology and sociology) for classes IX-XII. Twelve (12) courses and twenty one (21) courses have been completed in the first cycle and second cycle (completed on 30 Nov. 2018) on SWAYAM platform (https://swayam.gov.in/) respectively. Nearly 22,000 students and 30,000 students were registered in the first cycle and second cycle respectively.

(iv) CIET-NCERT has been assigned the task of developing e-resources for Master of Education (M.Ed.) course jointly with Allahabad University. One course (Educational Administration, Management and Leadership in School Education) has been completed first cycle on SWAYAM platform in which 2115 were enrolled. The second cycle of this course is offered from 2 July 2018.

Besides, an online course on action research for teachers is conducted in regular intervals in the MOODLE platform (http://ictcurriculum.gov.in/ ). Post Graduate Diploma in Guidance and Counselling for in-service teachers is also offered through the same course portal. Several other online courses are developed for inservice teachers professional development and delivered through the portal https://itpd.ncert.org.in/.

(v) A programme for utilization of satellite communication technologies for transmission of educational e-contents through 32 National Channels i.e. SWAYAM PRABHA DTH-TV has been launched. CIET-NCERT is the national coordinator for one DTH TV channel i.e., Kishore Manch (#31) and has started feeding a 24x7 educational TV channel w.e.f. 09 July, 2018. Everyday four hour fresh slot is telecast and repeated six times in 24 hours to provide learning opportunities for the stake holders, as per their convenience. Besides, NIOS is running 5 channels for teachers, for Secondary and Sr. Secondary levels and for sign language.

(vi) MHRD has launched Diksha Portal for providing digital platform to teachers giving them an opportunity to learn and train themselves and connect with teacher community. The portal envisages to help teachers boost their teaching skills and create their own separate profile with their skills and knowledge, and help in improving quality of education with use of latest technologies in education sector.

Sharanya Manivannan is a poet at heart. She has published two books of poetry (Witchcraft and The Altar of the Only World), of course. But her prose, too, is ceaselessly lyrical. It's best not to approach The Queen of Jasmine Country like a regular novel, therefore.

Sure, there are richly drawn characters and a narrative, if not precisely a plot, but one keeps wanting to stay and re-read, not move along. The writing demands sensory immersion, making this slim 143-page novel a deliciously slow read. Each paragraph is a time capsule of flavours and smells and visions that will transport the attentive reader into a world lovingly researched and fiercely imagined.

In the town of Puduvai, in 9th century Tamil Nadu, a young girl named Kodhai describes the year she turned 16, acquiring both a sexual self and the powerful poetic voice that would make her immortal as the saint-poet Andal. Bhakti is nothing if not personal, and when we meet Kodhai's adoptive father, Vishnuchittan, he has already departed from the intellectualised religiosity of his Brahmin heritage to walk that path. As Kodhai puts it: ""My father, the son of a priestly teacher, wanted only to knot garlands for his god and to sing to him."" And later: ""When he closed his eyes, verses came to him whole, and in them he loved his lord like a mother does her child.""

Kodhai follows her father, in both her life and her poems, creating an even more intimate relationship with the divine. The first time she wears Vishnuchittan's garland for the lord, she is a child, playfully transgressing the boundaries between sacred and profane. But then the lord chides her father for chiding her, and the child's pleasure grows into a full-blown adult attachment, body merging with soul: ""I became the consort of that god who wants only to be draped by a garden-fresh garland that has first belonged to me.""

Manivannan is not the first Indian writer in English to explore the sensual possibilities of bhakti. Girish Karnad's striking play Flowers (also about a garland-making priest) and Kiran Nagarkar's marvellous Cuckold (about Mirabai) come to mind. But Jasmine Country travels in a world of women. Kodhai's neighbour, young as herself, is married into wretchedly normal wifehood: ""I have seen her mouth thin as a line in the sand, her hand over her belly almost a fist."" Meanwhile, Kodhai keeps the pavai nombu vows with the cowherd women, praying for a lover to surpass all lovers.

The flame of Kodhai's erotic yearning makes her like other women, and simultaneously distinguishes her from them. ""I have been denied what should come to all in the material world, and I want to transcend it. But I also want its deepest ecstasy. I do not know how else I will survive."" Like Andal herself, this is a rare and incandescent book."

Eat wise

There are no prizes for guessing that in the food and nutrition sphere, ""keto"" was definitely the buzzword of the year. But even a cursory observation will clarify that fermentation and fermented food, and nutrition substitutes were just as popular. As a result, specialised teas, spiced coffee, a variety of funguses like snow fungus and kikurage and non-dairy milks such as almond, peanut, coconut, cashew, hemp, oat, pecan, flax, and pea protein were in vogue. Here's what experts have to say.

Pure desi ghee

* ""Sesame seed paste will be the new peanut butter, fats will be the new protein, particularly oils like coconut and ghee, and alcohol-free sparkling drinks such as fruit-based bubbly or orange wine will also see a rise this coming year,"" reveals chef Vikramjit Roy of The Wine Rack, Mumbai. He recently created a healthy menu for the restaurant-bar and he adds, ""Although there has been a considerable growth of 'meatless' meats globally, it's unlikely to make a sustainable impact in India.""

Vikramjit Roy and Sarah Todd

* Australian chef Sarah Todd who co-curated the menu with Roy elaborates, ""People are becoming aware of health to live a more energetic life and not only to control weight."" Maintaining good gut health will be a priority in 2019, and Todd explains why. ""I have been focusing on maintaining good gut health and have instantly noticed the difference. It's important to focus on what's going in the body and encourage good

bacteria since we live fast-paced lives.""

Maahek Nair and Shraddha Kapoor after a session

* Nutritionist Maahek Nair is currently working with actor Shraddha Kapoor for her upcoming biopic on Olympic badminton champion Saina Nehwal, and has clients like host Manish Paul and TV actor Asha Negi. Nair believes that the ketogenic diet is here to stay, along with carb cycling and intermittent fasting.

* ""Carb cycling is great because alternating between high and low carb days cuts your body fat percentage down while still ensuring you have enough fuel for your muscles to rebuild,"" she explains, adding, ""On the other hand, intermittent fasting is a great way to lose weight, but it's more a lifestyle choice than a diet plan.""

Breathe wellness

Awareness about the health benefits of yoga has never been stronger and it has perpetrated the participation of a huge number of people in the practice. Gyms, schools, colleges, old age homes and even workplaces are encouraging it in a big way,"" says Nikitaa Parmar, yoga teacher and therapist at RESET, a fitness studio in Bandra that is popular among celebrities. According to Parmar, the biggest wellness trend in 2019 will be holistic living and healing. ""Malaika Arora, Kareena Kapoor Khan, and Shilpa Shetty are already following the module,"" she shares.

* The holistic approach to yoga is hinged on synchronising the body, mind and soul. ""Even if you are eating right and exercising on a regular basis, but are stressed or disturbed most of the time, sooner or later, that is going to show in your body and start harming it at all levels,"" she elaborates.

Nikitaa Parmar

* Asanas, pranayama and breathing techniques not only help in keeping you fit, but also benefit body organs and keep diseases at bay. At the same time, it works on the mental level by improving concentration, focus, memory and aids in managing stress levels. The results are loss of extra fat, increase in strength, energy and flexibility and a balanced state of mind.

* Brands have come up with organic, comfortable, and stylish clothing to wear during workout or yoga sessions. These are usually made of recyclable material and allow the skin to breathe.

Karle trains Sonam K Ahuja

Fad to fit

Fitness expert Radhika Karle, who has been training actor Sonam K Ahuja for six years and has also trained Bollywood beauty Jacqueline Fernandez and filmmaker Vidhu Vinod Chopra, says pilates, which was a huge fad in 2018, will continue to be popular in 2019 along with aerial silks yoga and functional training. The in-demand expert outlines why the fitness routine works.

* Pilates is a great form of exercise as anyone aged 10 to 100 can practice it with a few props like the Franklin ball, pilates ring and foam roller.

* Mat pilates is the most challenging as you have no assistance and therefore require a significant amount of core strength to perform most of the exercises.

Radhika Karle

* It helps create concentric muscle contraction (shortening of the muscle) on one side of the body while the muscle on the opposite side contracts eccentrically (lengthening of the muscle) which aids in uniform, long, and lean muscle development which drastically reduces the risk of injury.

* ""Fitness is evolving as clients are worried less about losing weight. They are increasingly looking at workouts that feel good, are pain-free and help them become flexible and strong,"" she tells us."

Soon, I got a home teacher, and in a year, we had reached a level where I could practise on my own. One day, while browsing in a bookstore I got my hands on Yoga: A Gem for Women, by Geeta S Iyengar, the youngest daughter of BKS Iyengar. That was the first time I read about a woman yoga teacher talking about the importance of yoga in a woman's life, which is strange, because yoga is done mostly by women, with a predominance of male teachers!

The book is a must-read for all women, as it covers the major stages of life and the changes the body goes through at every age. I began using the book to take me through my daily practice, and within a few months, I felt stronger, both in my mind and body.

Though I have met Geetaji, as she is called by all, I never practised with her, but I have had the opportunity to study under her lifelong student Zarina Kolah. Through her, I got to know of Geetaji's philosophy and teachings. Iyengar yoga uses simple props like a rolled towel, a brick, a chair, a rope, making yoga accessible to all, even to people who have physical disabilities.

Geeta Iyengar showed us that the path of yoga requires dedication: she started teaching at the age of 15 and was dedicated to her father and his way of teaching. In fact, she died just a few days after the centenary celebrations of her father's life. She chose to be a sanyasin, carrying forward the work he had started.

Sit with your legs stretched. Lift the hips a little, off the floor, and place a cushion under the hips.

Inhale; bend the legs towards the chest. Exhale; drop the right knee to the right and the left knee to the left, and allow the feet to touch each other. Place the palm on the floor behind the hips and extend the spine by pressing on the palms. Hold this pose, breathing deeply for 10 breaths.

Inhale; lift the palm and reach forward to hold the toes or feet with both your hands.

Exhale; bend the elbows on the thighs and press them down towards the floor, feeling a stretch on the hips and thighs. If the knees don't touch the floor, do not force them, as this is due to tight hips. Place a block or bolster under the knees to support them. Hold this pose for a few breaths; release.

Benefits: This classic pose benefits the entire body. Apart from being a hip opener, it stimulates the abdominal organs, the ovaries, and kidneys. The regular practice of the pose benefits a woman's body at all stages of her life."

NDA government lacks the majority in the Rajya Sabha and the upper house has seen regular disruptions since the beginning of this winter session leading to early adjournments, sometimes within minutes of start of its proceedings for the day.

The government has listed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2018 in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. The Bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on Thursday following a walkout by several parties including the Congress and NDA ally AIADMK.

Out of the 299 parliamentary constituencies that went to polls, six saw the use of electronic voting machines (EVMs), a regular feature in neighbouring India since decades ago.

Voting for the 11th national election began with the machines being used in the six seats selected through lottery. These are: Dhaka-6, Dhaka-13, Chattogram-9, Rangpur-3, Khulna-2 and Satkhira-2. The six seats comprises over 2.1 million voters. The results from these six seats could be announced within hours after the voting ends, Bangladeshi media reported.

Electronic voting machines created problems across different voting centres in Dhaka-13 and Dhaka-6, slowing down voting process and leading to long queues, the Daily Star newspaper reported.

Voters in some areas have reported facing trouble when the machines could not recognise their fingerprints, BDnews24.com reported.

Dhaka-13 voter Jagat Dashi Mondol, a septuagenarian, was smiling as she came out of the polling centre at Mohammadpur's Borabo Government Primary School.

When asked about how she felt using an EVM, said, ""easy, very easy."" The polling centre's Presiding Officer Jayanta Chandra Deb said he replaced three EVMs when they stopped working.

Nazrul Islam, a retired engineer, said his fingerprint was not matching when he went to vote at the polling centre in Lalmatia Mohila College.

""But I got to vote using my voter ID. It didn't take much time.""

Gazi Hossain, a former librarian of Lalmatia Mohila College, was unhappy with the EVM because of the time wasted in trying to match his fingerprint in the machine. ""It wasn't matching, so it took more time, that's a problem,"" he said.

Bimal Chandra, a retired teacher, voted using EVM at the Mohammadpur Chand Community Centre. ""I just pressed two buttons on the EVM. One on the poll symbol, then another on a green button. It takes roughly ten seconds. It takes more time to be marked on the thumb with ink. ""It takes just 20 minutes to count the votes from EVM centres. This is good,"" said Chandra.

On December 27, the Election Commission organised mock voting at selected polling centres to educate voters on how to use EVMs. The EVM technology is being used for the first time at the national election level, eight years after being introduced in local government elections in the country.

The machines were first used in the Chittagong City Corporation election of June 2010. However, the Election Commission stopped using the technology in 2015 due to some errors. The machines were later reintroduced in the Rangpur City Corporation election in 2016.

During this year's city corporation polls, EVMs were used in three polling centres in Khulna City Corporation with 10,000 voters; two centres in Sylhet City Corporation with 5,413 voters; 11 centres in Barishal City Corporation with 25,000 voters; and two centres in Rajshahi City Corporation with 3,383 voters, the Daily Star reported.

During the Election Commission's electoral dialogues, most of the 40 registered parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of former premier Khalida Zia and its allies, opposed the idea of using EVMs in the election.

However, five political parties, including the ruling Awami League of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, its allies Workers Party of Bangladesh, Jatiya Samajtantrik Dal faction led by Hasanul Haq Inu and Bangladesher Samyabadi Dal (M-L) and Zaker Party supported the use of EVMs.

The BNP has all along been opposing the EC move, alleging that this might facilitate ""the government's plan for election engineering"".

The Bangladesh Machine Tools Factory (BMTF) imported parts of the EVMs and assembled them in Bangladesh ahead of the general election, media reports said.

Intrigued by the cultural processes and atmosphere of teaching-learning in the school, I wondered what makes this school advance with true spirit of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, when the rest of the country is grappling with the meaning and implementation of the NCF. To serve my curiosity better, I asked the teachers and the head teacher to help me understand how they are bringing about change in the culture of learning, constructing knowledge, developing professional teachers and creating an atmosphere of inclusive learning.

In response to my questions, I was told that intervention by the Asian Development Bank and the Government of Meghalaya to improve quality of education has been instrumental to this change. Implementing organisation, IPE Global Ltd, has designed and developed Teachers' Professional Development Programme, which was the medium through which teachers were trained for developing critical competencies which have consequences on learning and quality of education. The combination of institutional synergies has induced change that will revolutionise landscape of school education.

At Mawsynram Higher Secondary School, one of the oldest schools, unfolds the story of reviving quality of education by means of redefining pathways to traverse and achieve what actually learning must look like! As reported by a schoolteacher, children travel from distant places, traversing terrains and the weather to come to this school to pursue education. On being asked about the role of schooling, it is worthy to know that teachers talk about the conduciveness of school and classrooms to foster learning which is the basis of positive student engagement in the lessons.

Teachers' concerns before the intervention seemed to be limited around low quality, low learning outcomes and poor performance. This was a deadlock, which seemed to be unbreakable besides commitment, subject expertise and hard work. Lacking in training, teachers struggled hard to remain motivated and confident to bring about change in learning levels of students. The Professional Development Programme has helped teachers to unearth their potentials by well contextualised approach to training and handholding in the form of 'on-the-job training'.

The teachers now have clear understanding of student-centered learning; their implementation of culturally responsive teaching-learning methods, collaborated learning, efficient instruction and assessment strategies have propelled the culture of inclusive quality education. This is further strengthened by means of continuous professional development; teachers are involved extensively in practices such as drafting integrated lesson plans and addressing issues concerning students' learning by forming professional learning communities or communities of learning as they call it. In the whole process of the transformational change, ICT has been seamlessly intertwined.

The foremost challenge to the transformational process is to ensure sustainability. The potential sustainability of this intervention looks positive; attitudinal change, handholding support and cultural shift in the professional development are in place.

However, for the process to continue and flourish, it is important that the school gets regular support, mentoring and handholding to advance to the fullest.

Over the last 4 years, the mission has picked up pace and as government says turned into a national movement, with people from all walks of life doing their bit. One of the key successes of the Abhiyan are the Swachh heroes who have emerged across India. Swachhgrahis, as they are now famous as, are swachh warriors who are championing the cause of sanitation and hygiene in India and giving the much need impetus to the programme and help sustain it.

PM Modi, in an event organised to conclude the campaign Champaran Satyagraha, 'Chalo Champaran - From Satyagraha to Swachhagraha' lauded the efforts by awarding ten Swachhagrahis (sanitation motivators) who have performed outstandingly in their villages and set a benchmark for others, this year. The swachhagrahis from across the country are promoting Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS) to motivate the communities to adopt collective behaviour change.

This Swachhagrahi started his journey by building a toilet at his own home after a voluntary organisation gave a presentation in his village about the diseases that can spread due to open defecation. From there, Ramesh actively contributed to the process of making his village ODF and continued to support the Mandal administration in community mobiliSation activities. He acted as a role model by working with the community to ensure that toilet construction material is available.

His close engagement with the community helped him win their confidence for daily monitoring, resolving issues being faced during construction, reporting the ground level problems to the officials concerned and getting them resolved. Due to Ramesh's unwavering efforts, his district is ODF today, and they are witnessing decreasing health problems and increasing productivity. Thanks to Ramesh's efforts, the village now has 506 toilets from a mere 45 before he started his mission. Along with this, Chittoor district achieved ODF title this year on April 1 with construction of close to 4 lakh (3,80,339) toilets.

I built 400 toilets and to ensure that people make use of these toilets I used to visit common defecation spots, both in the morning and evening, of all the six villages in the gram panchayat. If someone was found defecating in the open, I would ask them the reason behind not using toilets and counsel them, says A. Ramesh.

Ateeq Ahmad is not only a Swachhata Champion, but also a behaviour change communication Champion. Hailing from Bijnor district in Uttar Pradesh, Ahmad, A teacher and professor by profession, is a proponent of CAS as he has trained and encouraged many other motivators. With the understanding that generic communication tools can't induce behaviour change, he created posters, booklets, brochures and more, using examples relatable to local culture and context. While his tools have created the necessary impact in his block, they are now being scaled up at the state level, especially the Swachhata song, a booklet on the 'Key Steps of Triggering' and a couple of short movies on the issue of sanitation.

I have always been passionate about the cause of cleanliness and hygiene and propagated the same to my students. When Swachh Bharat was launched I decided to put my thoughts into practice and make a difference in my district, he says.

Alamarathupatty village of Tamil Nadu is ODF only due to the unprecedented commitment and passion of S. Rajalakshmi, an active member of a self-help group. Rajalakshmi participated in numerous sanitation and interpersonal communication activities, and supported many motivators into Master Trainers. She promoted access to toilets as a right, and made community mapping and motivation as her primary tools. Her regular meetings with Village Poverty Reduction Committee (VPRC) members, and awareness drives in schools, led to public drives for toilet construction and usage.

She hails from Nalanda district, Bihar and is a passionate Swachhagrahi who was nominated for her hard work for achieving ODF status for her village, panchayat, and later 10 wards in the vicinity. A mobilisation activity towards facilitating the construction of toilets, that takes months, or even years was completed in just two months, thanks to Rinku's passion and motivation.

Her main aim was to change people's mind-set and make the community aware about the issues associated with Open Defecation. She held detailed discussions with mothers and elders in the village about the health and economic benefits of constructing and using toilets, successfully, driving a Jan Andolan to construct toilets across villages.

Last year, I attended one swachh bharat abhiyan workshop and that was it. Soon, I started taking more and more workshops in order to learn different techniques so that I can motivate people to construct a basic necessity - a toilet. The villagers are not trained to use a toilet at home, they need to be taught and taught well. If they will face problems, then they will start going out in the fields, as it is an easy option. To change this, wherever I go, I make sure, I am training villagers to construct their own toilet, how to use a toilet and how to keep it clean, Rinku told NDTV.

Morish Jaria took it upon himself to make his Panchayat ODF and fully dedicated himself to the cause of safe sanitation. The biggest challenge faced by his panchayat as well as the community was lack of road connectivity, which hampered availability of material for construction. By motivating the community, carrying materials himself using bullock carts or cycles and even by foot in the more remote areas, he actively led the change. He acted as A role model and encouraged his peers to make all possible efforts to construct toilet, and then use them. His selfless work was also recognised by the District Collector, Simdega.

Jupelli Neeraja is not only an active Swachhagrahi but also a passionate 'Sanitation Champion'. She did all that a Swachhagrahi should do to empower the community members to construct and use toilets. In the beginning, the emphasis was on motivation, mason training, group meeting, and interpersonal communication, and later she shifted the focus to community monitoring. Neeraja led from the front, inspired and personally monitored all the common places of open defecation in her village, every morning. To sustain this momentum, she motivated the villagers to install an innovative method of using two PVC Pipes (6 inches width 1.2 Mtrs. Length) to pour vegetable waste, and converted it to compost manure for homestead gardens & farms.

Monika Ijardar emerged as one of the most devoted supporters of Community Approaches to Sanitation (CAS), a module introduced by the government focused towards rural India achieving ODF. This well-educated, young girl used the approach successfully to make her village and later the whole Gram Panchayat Open Defecation Free (ODF). But this fervent swachhagrahi didn't stop at that, she went ahead and used the same approach to mobilise the surrounding villages and Gram Panchayats. It was due to her unrelenting effort that 61 Gram Panchayats became ODF, and her block became the first in the district to become completely Open Defecation Free.

I tried motivating the women and girls of the house - with questions like 'how can you showcase your private areas to public like that', 'why don't you make a toilet, when you have an option. I have helped more than 1500 families, today they all are enjoying the benefits of having a toilet at home. I won't stop my fight, today I have made Raigarh free from open defecation, I will make sure more and more district get the benefit of a toilet, Monika told NDTV.

45-year-old farmer, Manilal used all the tools available in the armoury of a Swachhagrahi to catalyse behavioural change towards safe sanitation practices and toilet construction. Using motivation, interpersonal communication, village meetings, triggering, and awareness building activities he managed to bring about a huge difference.

He employed advocacy to promote safe (preferred) toilet construction technology viz. twin pit toilets. He turned the whole exercise into a ceremony - every morning, the Sarpanch and Nigrani Samiti members, accompanied by a priest visited households to mark the laying out of twin pit toilet (muhurath karna) construction. This novel practice motivated the households to construct toilets.

When we started the campaign, there were some 280 toilets in the village and we had to build over 700 toilets. I tell people to construct toilets, be disease free and save money on medicines, says Manilal Rana

Yeshi Wangmu's dedication towards the goals of Swachh Bharat Mission has motivated her to continue working to drive behavioural change in the villages of Jang Block - an area where the community members have long had a very negative attitude towards construction and use of toilets. Innumerable Gram-sabha meetings and Information Education and communication (IEC) activities were conducted to increase awareness and mobilise the community.

Not only for individual households, but she also sought wider cooperation from the Panchayati Raj Institution members to make IEC activities more effective. The village and Gram Panchayat are ODF today and the community members attribute this behaviour change to Yeshi's commitment to the cause.

Everyone has an ability to do something for the country. I didn't have any resource myself to bring about such a huge change, but I did make some contribution. All you need is dedication and desire to achieve something. I urge all of you who are sitting there, get up and simply talk to people. A lot can change, if you will start spreading the awareness to others, Yeshi told NDTV.

Bonti Saikia's never say die commitment towards making the village and Gram Panchayat ODF is something worth admiring. She left no stone unturned to ensure not just that each and every household had a toilet but used it. With education as her tool, Bonti started going door-to-door and started teaching people who didn't have a toilet at home about why it is important to get one and the basic rules to follow for a healthy life.

The methods used by Bonti Saikia were simple & persistent, adopted with the sole objective of making the society healthier and better. Today, her Gram Panchayat office is one of the cleanest and well-maintained in the district, and there has been significant decline in diarrhoea cases in the tea gardens of her Gram Panchayat."

Thanks to his ripped body and lean physique, which is evident in the promos of the film, there are memes on how such a fit Sonu can be beaten by the Padmaavat actor! Sonu has a fitting reply, ""In the entire movie, for two hours, I will be beating up the hero. In the last 15 minutes, if I get overpowered by him, it's okay; rest two hours, I enjoy the space of being a stronger and powerful character. Also, you have to see the movie to know what happens, because it is not always about being beaten up.""

Here, Sonu talks about his love for playing the baddie, working in a Rohit Shetty film and, of course, his fitness regime.

Dabangg was an extremely significant film for me, but it is also important that I choose my roles right and not categorise myself in a particular set of roles. I was doing films in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Mandarin Chinese, playing positive as well as negative roles. If your film and character are a hit, chances are you'll get typecast in that space. It was a deliberate decision to not do all such films that came my way. Post Dabangg, I did films like Ramaiya Vastavaiya and Happy New Year, in which I played positive characters with streaks of comedy. They did really well. I made some right decisions.

Yes, it is a Rohit Shetty movie, full of action, drama and larger-than-life characters. It is completely in the commercial space. My character's name is Durva Ranade -- for the first time I play a Maharashtrian and I am pretty excited about it.

I did my engineering in Nagpur and had a lot of Maharashtrian friends. I was impressed with the language and at that time I didn't think I would be an actor. But, unknowingly, I learnt the language and got a hold of it. Nothing can be better than playing a Maharashtrian character in a Rohit Shetty film. But I had a special teacher during the dubbing so that the accent was right.

In negative roles, there are more layers to portray. In Simmba, my character has a family -- wife, kids and mother. The way Rohit has done the layering makes it special. So, when people watch the film, they will not just see the negative part, but also the layers to it, which are well-defined and well-written. Nothing is more important than the script or the role; I thoroughly enjoy playing a baddie, too.

Fitness has been a part of my life even before I became an actor. I always share my trainer with others. Whether it's Kapil Sharma, Kangana Ranaut or Farah Khan, I don't mind sharing my trainer. I tell him, skip my work out, but not theirs. I tell him to be regular with them and push them to spend some extra hours in the gym. It is important to spread awareness about fitness. I am glad Kapil is getting fit. When he met me recently, he said 'Paaji I want to get back on my toes and become fit'. In a few months you will see a new Kapil.

(Laughs) Taking off my shirt has become a part of my life, whether it is at award ceremonies or reality shows. As long as people enjoy it, why not? A lot of actors used to tell me, 'If we had a physique like yours, we would never wear clothes ever!"" That's a compliment, but if it helps the ratings of a show or gives them a promo moment, why not remove my shirt? They tell me, if you come on our show, it has to be a mandate that you go bare-bodied or show your abs. It is good because it keeps me on my toes and I have to always be ready to showcase my physique."

The best thing about mistakes is that one learns something from them. However, that lesson can be costly and unrepairable if that is learnt from your wrong investment decisions. A prudent man can't avoid the taxes, but he can surely reduce them by learning from the mistakes of others.

Tax planning is a legitimate process to reduce one's tax liability by availing all the permissible allowances, deductions, exemptions and rebates. Some of these benefits accrue after the fulfilment of certain conditions. In this article, we shall discuss about the investment-linked tax deductions and the common mistakes a taxpayer generally makes.

One should align one's tax planning with long-term financial goals. Tax-saving is an important part of overall financial planning and should ideally be planned throughout the year. Three-fourth of the current fiscal year is over and taxpayers are now left with just 3 months to plan or re-arrange their tax affairs.

Taxpayers generally ignore the important factors, i.e., return on investment, liquidity, etc., while making the investment decisions and have an eye on the quantum of tax savings. One should always distinguish between the end goal and auxiliary benefits of an investment. The end goal should be return on investment and building corpus for the future, and auxiliary benefits should be tax savings. In a nut-shell, even if you have not made any tax-saving investment, don't go for it in great haste. Make an informed decision by avoiding the following common mistakes:

Section 80C is a common provision for pool of investments with an overall deduction limit of up to Rs 1.5 lakh. We have witnessed that due to lack of awareness, taxpayers keep investing in all those options which are eligible only for deduction under Section 80C, i.e., insurance policies, FDs, ELSS, etc. Consequently, the limit prescribed under Section 80C is fully exhausted, while as other deductions remain unutilized. So, to get most of deductions, diversify your investment portfolio and spending. Any contribution to the NPS is eligible for Section 80CCD deductions and payment for health insurance premium and preventive health checkup expenses give you Section 80D deduction.

So, first make a list of all deductions that could be availed during the year and the investment that would be eligible for such deductions. Check your salary slips, bank statements and credit card statements to find out if there are any investments that are already eligible for deductions, i.e., housing loan EMI, contribution to PF, children's school fees, etc. If some deficit remains, then plan for making further investments.

Taxpayers generally have the sole intention of tax saving while making any investment. They ignore the factors of return and risk factors. Tax saving can't be an end result, it is an ancillary benefit we achieve when we choose an investment plan. Wisely choose the investment options by taking into account the options available, assured returns, previous years' return, etc., so as to minimize the tax liability and to increase the returns.

For example, you have an option to invest in bank FDs, PPF or NSC. All of these investments are eligible for Section 80C deductions. The factors to choose the right investment plan should be the lock-in period, rate of return and risk factors. All of them are completely secure. FDs and NSCs have a lock-in period of 5 years, whereas the PPF has a lock-in period of 15 years. In terms of interest, NSCs and PPFs provide the same rate of interest (8% w.e.f. October 1, 2018), whereas SBI offers 6.85% on 5-year FDs. If the term of investment is not a deciding factor for an investor, PPF would be a better investment opportunity for him as the interest earned on PPF is tax free whereas interest earned on NSC is chargeable to tax. Thus, while making tax planning one should consider the financial goals along with tax saving.

The government always pushes for digital payments as they can be traced back to check any false claim. Many sections allow deduction or exemption only when the investment is made by any mode other than cash. Before making payment for any investment, a taxpayer should always check if payment in cash would be eligible for deduction. Example, Section 80D allows deduction for medical insurance premium only if it is paid through banking channels. Similarly, Section 80G restricts deductions for any donation in excess of Rs 10,000 if it is made by way of cash payments.

The most common mistake a taxpayer commits is planning investments in the last quarter of the year. He ends up with investments in less-yielding schemes or schemes which are not eligible for deduction. Thus, to avoid bad investments, start your tax planning from the start of the year. Before making any investment, one should evaluate all the available avenues thoroughly. It is important for a taxpayer to invest in multiple schemes so as to diversify the investment portfolio. If you have not yet done tax planning for the year 2018-19, you should plan your investments according to your financial goals and reduce your tax liability instead of delaying it any more.

Most of the people don't even know that the expenses they incur in their day-to-day lives can also help them save taxes. They often ignore the regular expenses made during the year which are eligible for deductions. So, you should first learn about all the expenses which qualify for deductions. Example, tuition fees, medical expenditure, stamp duty and registration fees paid on purchase of immovable property, donations, interest on housing loans, etc. So, keep a track of all eligible expenses made during the year along with their receipts so as to claim deductions in such respect at the end of the year. Just because of such ignorance we end up paying higher taxes, even though we could have saved them.

As it is almost the end of third quarter of fiscal, buckle up and start planning wisely for your taxes and investments. Plan wisely, evaluate rationally and execute brilliantly to maximize returns and minimize the tax burden. Remember that your best teacher is your last mistake and don't repeat a mistake twice."

He takes up a night job upon his doctor's suggestion. But taking up this job brings out a side of him no one knew existed.

Review: For anyone who has seen Dan Gilroy's beauty of a debut, Nightcrawler, the basic premise of Idam Jagath with the way Nishith (Sumanth) is characterised will seem awfully familiar. Here too we have a protagonist who likes to prowl the deserted, dark streets looking for the perfect gory footage that is sensational enough to get him the moolah at the news station. There's also the fact that his conscience is sketchy enough that you never want to believe he's as selfish as he seems, wanting to see the good in him because he's not bad enough. However, by the end of the film, debutant Anil's Nishith too steps into the territory that makes Louis Bloom from Nightcrawler as bad as he is.

Nishith is a man suffering from Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder that keeps him awake at nights, making it difficult for him to hold regular day jobs. When he finds stringers shooting footage of an accident one night, he decides to buy a camera and become a stringer too. But the deeper he gets into the job, the more he's willing to bend ethics to get the kind of footage and consequently the money he wants. When he comes in possession of valuable footage that might change his life, he refuses to stop putting his life in danger. This is where Idam Jagath sets itself apart from Dan Gilroy's film, with all the frills it unnecessarily fills itself with.

Because there's also a love track featuring Mahati (Anju Kurian), an ex-software professional turned teacher/do-gooder that seems to exist for no reason at all. Because neither love nor his friendship with Anand (Satya) seems to tip the scale for Nishith, a monster who grows worse with time. Nishith's characterisation is like a slow burn, never making it clear if he would really do something you think he's capable of. And this is where the intrigue created by the film ends. None of the other elements put in seem to work, not even when lives are in danger and hearts broken.

What makes it even worse are the scenes which seem like a total and complete rip-off of Dan's original, with the similarities so on-the-nose, it's hard to ignore. The supposedly mystery track too is filled with plot holes the size of a massive crater and you simply don't invest enough in it to care. The conundrum the director throws at the audience of course is interesting - does a reporter do his job and shoot footage or does he intervene and help the people he's filming - but there's never a satisfying enough answer to that.

Despite Sumanth delivering a stupendous performance and his character Nishith - an alternate version of Louis Bloom - creating enough intrigue, it's simply not enough. Idam Jagath manages to make a mockery of the justice system, reporters, politicians, reporters, editors and most importantly, the forensic science in a span of two hours. Anju Kurian makes a mediocre debut, not having the scope to showcase anything with her un-fleshed out character. Satya as Anand too has nothing much to do in the film, nor does anyone else really.

Give this one a chance this weekend if you want to check out Sumanth being someone other than the quintessential lover boy and for the novelty of finally having a film that does not cop out when it comes to its lead character having sketchy ethics. But give it a miss if the similarities with Dan's Nightcrawler are bound to irk you, because the film is filled with them."

Nishikant Khajuria

JAMMU, Dec 27: During his maiden meeting with the Vice-Chancellors of all the State universities in Jammu and Kashmir, here today, Governor Satya Pal Malik took an overview of functioning of these institutions of higher learning and asked for issuance of Academic Calendar well in advance, making biometric attendance a compulsory feature of varsities, strict compliance of UGC norms for selection of teaching positions and introduction of stringent quality control in B Ed colleges.

Official sources told the Excelsior that the Governor, who is also Chancellor of all the State universities, sought information about manner of appointments in these varsities and regulations for the same, funding of the universities, infrastructure for the sports activities on the campuses, revision of syllabus and general issues of these institutions.

Asking all the Vice-Chancellors to remain prepare for the respective apex Council/Executive meetings soon, sources said that the Governor also expressed his desire to personally visit campuses of the State universities in near future for on the spot assessment.

This was for the first time that Satya Pal Malik, who assumed the charge of Governor J&K on August 23 this year, met with the Vice-Chancellors of State universities.

During the more than one and half hour long meeting at the Raj Bhawan Jammu, each Vice-Chancellor was given time for presenting brief overview of his/her respective institution after which the Governor made remarks for better and transparent functioning of these universities, sources added.

As the issue of Jammu University land under Army occupation also came up during the meeting, the Governor asked the JU Vice-Chancellor Prof Manoj K Dhar to take up the matter with Divisional Commissioner Jammu for necessary action in this regard, sources disclosed.

While chairing the meeting, Governor directed the Vice-Chancellors that Academic Calendar for each Academic Session should be issued well in advance and all the backlogs if any must be cleared for avoiding inconvenience to the students besides streamlining the system. He also stressed that biometric attendance should be a compulsory feature of the Universities even as no time frame was yet fixed for adopting the same.

Even as the Governor stressed for further improving teacher- student ratio, he, however, made it clear that selection procedure for the teaching positions must comply with the UGC norms. He further stated that stringent quality control measures should be introduced in the B Ed colleges affiliated with the universities.

Taking keen interest on enhancing sport infrastructure at the campuses, the Governor stressed that sports and extracurricular activities be encouraged as an integral component of University education and in this regard, he advised that the annual Inter University Sports meet be made a regular feature.

According to an official spokesman, Governor also laid stress on promoting entrepreneurship among the youth and suggested that Universities may introduce suitable courses in this area. He emphasized focus towards introducing vocational and entrepreneurial courses for the skill development of the students.

The Governor also stressed that gainful benefits under RUSA must be maximized and all higher Education Institutions must ensure NAAC Accreditation. He emphasized upon all the Universities to enhance their research capabilities and to update the syllabus regularly so as to keep abreast with rapidly changing global developments. He observed that there should be a State level Advanced Research facility with latest equipment for promoting research in the new and innovative areas.

Governor advised the Farm Universities to undertake innovative research in improving seed varieties particularly oilseeds and pulses and suggested that measures be taken for reducing the yield gap between the farmers' field and the experimental plots of the Universities by deputing a team of researchers for finding out reasons for such variations and addressing them suitably. He also stressed strengthening of extension services and rapid transfer of technologies to equip the farmers with latest know-how.

Besides Khurshid Ahmed Ganai, Advisor to Governor; Umang Narula, Principal Secretary to Governor and Sarita Chouhan, Commissioner Secretary Higher Education, the high level meeting was attended by Manzoor Ahmad Lone, Secretary Agriculture Production Department; Prof Talat Ahmad, Vice Chancellor, University of Kashmir; Prof Manoj Kumar Dhar, Vice Chancellor, University of Jammu; Dr Pradeep K. Sharma, Vice Chancellor, SKUAST-Jammu; Prof Nazeer Ahmed, Vice Chancellor, SKUAST-Kashmir; Prof Javed Musarrat, Vice Chancellor, Baba Ghulam Shah Badshah University, Rajouri; Prof Sheikh Javid Ahmad, Vice Chancellor, Cluster University Srinagar; Prof Anju Bhasin, Vice Chancellor, Cluster University of Jammu; Dr Sanjeev Jain, Vice Chancellor, Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University; Prof Mushtaq A Siddiqi, Vice Chancellor, Islamic University of Science & Technology, Awantipora and M R Andrabi, Director General Finance Department."

Chairing a high-level meet with the all the state universities' vice-chancellors at the Raj Bhawan here, Malik suggested regular update of the syllabus to keep pace with the rapidly-changing global developments.

The governor observed that there should be a state-level advanced research facility with the latest equipments for promoting research in the new and innovative areas.

Malik laid stress on enhancing the research capabilities and introduction of courses to promote entrepreneurship among the youth. He underlined to need to introduce vocational and entrepreneurial courses for the skill development of the students.

The governor advised the farm universities to undertake innovative research in improving seed varieties, particularly oilseeds and pulses.

The other suggestions by the governor are: compulsory biometric attendance, improved teacher-student ratio, issuing academic calendars well in advance, selection procedure for teaching positions in compliance with the UGC norms.

Malik emphasised that all higher education institutions must ensure NAAC accreditation and extracurricular activities be encouraged.

The Jammu and Kashmir accountant general (AG) is yet to make the CAG's report for the year 2017-18 public, even as the year is nearing its end, a senior official said Thursday.

The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) was submitted to Governor Satya Pal Malik long ago and it was supposed to be tabled in the budget session of the Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly during January-March, the official said.

""The report has not been made public. We have submitted the report to Jammu and Kashmir governor,"" In-charge AG of J&K, Shourjo Chatterjee told PTI.

Citing past precedents, the AG said unless the report was tabled in the state assembly, it could not be made public.

As the state is under President's rule, the Governor has to table the report in Parliament before it can be made public, he added.

""It is up to the Governor to facilitate tabling of the report in Parliament and after that it can be made public or he can wait for the new legislature to get elected,"" the AG said."

His name is Pediatric HAL.

HAL: Hi, I'm Pediatric HAL. I can show you how I feel by moving my face and my eyes.

Narrator: HAL is part of a line of medical training robots manufactured by a company called Gaumard. Gaumard makes humanlike robots that simulate childbirth, newborn care, surgery, and trauma wounds. Pediatric HAL is designed to mimic the reactions of a child around five years old. During training, doctors, nurses, and first responders all practice various simulations on HAL before treating real patients.

Narrator: In many situations, medical students practice on standardized patients who are actors faking certain symptoms, but those actors probably don't want to be stuck with a needle over and over again. Instead, students can use HAL to learn how to do more physically invasive procedures, like putting in a breathing tube or starting an IV. And because his body is programmable, HAL can show signs of poor health that an actor might not be able to mimic.

When you shine a light on HAL's eyes, his pupils may or may not dilate. Even really good actors probably can't control their pupils. And HAL actually responds to real equipment. If he starts to flatline, a nurse can use a defibrillator to shock his heart back into action. HAL also has a variety of internal motors and pumps that move air and fluids around, which help it mimic bodily functions, like breathing and using the bathroom.

Archetto: He has a small reservoir in his left finger, left middle finger, for glucose measurement. So you can take a regular glucometer and you can actually put a glucose solution in there, prick his finger, and it would give you an actual glucose reading.

Narrator: HAL also has reservoirs for holding fake urine, fake blood, and there's even one in his head for holding fake tears. We have artificial blood. It's honestly just a powder that you add water to and it creates a red fluid, but there's also urine and as I mentioned, there are tears. For tears, it's water. For urine, it's food coloring. Narrator: The educator can also modify HAL's responses on the fly. If a training team isn't working fast enough, the teacher can program HAL's software to make his blood pressure go up or his breathing get faster.

Archetto: Nothing ever goes according to plan in the emergency room or in critical care. So you may have a plan of care for a particular patient, but something changes and it all goes south in a hurry. We can make HAL respond just as a patient would be. So that's become so valuable in those learning environments.

Henry Henao: We have a concept called suspending disbelief. So it's the fact that, okay I know that it's a mannequin, it's a simulator. They know it's a mannequin and it's made of plastic and electronic parts, but they look beyond that. So we ask them to forgive the fact that it's not a real patient, and once they break through that they really start making very human connections to the patient in front of them. And they, yeah, it kind of melts away.

Narrator: People don't always communicate verbally, especially young children, and that's why HAL's creators programmed him to have these non-verbal reactions.

Archetto: When he cries, he cries real tears and that's important because, again, that's a way of communicating.

Narrator: At times, HAL's responses are so real that people respond to him like he's a human. Archetto: HAL was there and he was sitting in his bed and we made him cry, and one of the nurses, who was in attendance, reached down and actually picked him up and tried to console him. She actually hugged him. So, it does have that impact on caregivers. It makes the scenario very realistic.

HAL: My family says I'm one of the smartest kids around. I can show you how I feel by moving my face and my eyes and if you talk to me, I'll talk back."

There is no secret to happiness, but there is a science to it, says Tim Bono, a psychology lecturer in Arts & Sciences who teaches courses on happiness at Washington University in St. Louis.

In his recent book, ""When Likes Aren't Enough: A Crash Course in the Science of Happiness,"" Bono explores how the often overlooked details of day-to-day life can have a sizeable influence on our personal sense of well-being and happiness.

Simple Tips to Make Your Life Better This New Year

Based on his own research and other scientific studies, Bono offers the following tips for getting and staying happier in the coming year:

Get Outside and Move Around: Research confirms that a few minutes walking around in nature can boost both mood and energy levels. Exercise is key to our psychological health because it releases the brain's ""feel good"" chemicals.

Get More Happiness for Your Money: Studies show little connection between wealth and happiness, but there are two ways to get more bang for your happiness buck -- buy experiences instead of things and spend your money on others. The enjoyment one gets from an experience like a vacation or concert will far outweigh and outlast the happiness from acquiring another material possession. Doing good things for other people strengthens our social connections, which is foundational to our well-being.

Carve Out Time to Be Happy, Then Give It Away: People dream of finding an extra 30 minutes to do something nice for themselves, but using that time to help someone else is more rewarding and actually leaves us feeling empowered to tackle the next project, helping us feel more in control of our lives and even less pressed for time. This translates to higher levels of happiness and satisfaction.

Delay the Positive, Dispatch the Negative: Anticipation itself is pleasurable, and looking forward to an enjoyable experience can make it all that much sweeter. Wait a couple of days before seeing a new movie that just came out, plan your big vacation for later in the summer and try to take time to savor each bite of dessert. On the flip side, get negative tasks out of the way as quickly as possible -- anticipation will only make them seem worse.

Enjoy the Ride: People who focus more on process than outcome tend to remain motivated in the face of setbacks. They're better at sticking with major challenges and prefer them over the easy route. This ""growth mindset"" helps people stay energized because it celebrates rewards that come from the work itself. Focusing only on the end outcome can lead to premature burnout if things don't go well.

Embrace Failure: How we think about failure determines whether it makes us happy or sad. People who overcome adversity do better in life because they learn to cope with challenges. Failure is a great teacher, helping us realize what doesn't work so we can make changes for the better. As IBM CEO Thomas Watson once said, ""If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.""

Sweet Dreams: Get a full night's sleep on a regular basis. Our brains are doing a lot of important work while we sleep, including strengthening neural circuits that enhance mental acuity and help us to regulate our moods when we are awake. Sleep deprivation can lead to cognitive impairment similar to that of intoxication, and often is the prelude to an ill-tempered day.

Strengthen Your Willpower Muscles: Just like exercising arm muscles strengthens our capacity to lift heavy things, exercising willpower muscles in small, everyday behaviors strengthens our ability to stay focused at work. Resisting the temptation to check our phone for new text messages or emails when we're walking somewhere, or resisting the temptation to get the candy bar when we're in the checkout line at the grocery store, allows our willpower muscles to become stronger and, in turn, resistant to temptations that could sidetrack us in other aspects of our lives.

Introduce Variety into Your Day-to-day Activities: Human beings are attracted to novelty, and we can get bored if we have to do the same thing over and over. Changing things up every once in a while by taking on new projects, or by doing the same task but with music in the background, or by interacting with different people, can be one way to introduce variety and remain motivated to complete a task.

Stop Comparing Yourself to Others: It's hard to avoid tuning into what everyone else is doing, who just got the latest raise or promotion, or who's moving into a new house or going on a fancy vacation. But, social comparison is one of the biggest barriers to our overall happiness and motivation. Redirecting attention to our own internal standards for success and making progress based on what's realistic for us -- instead of getting caught up in how we measure up to others -- can go a long way for our psychological health and productivity.

Reach Out and Connect with Someone: Nothing is more important for our psychological health than high-quality friendships. Find an activity that allows you to get together with friends on a regular, ongoing basis. A weekly happy hour, poker night or TV show ensures consistency and momentum in your social interactions. People with high-quality relationships are not only happier, but they're also healthier. They recover from illnesses more quickly, live longer and enjoy more enriched lives.

Limit Time on Social Media: Facebook and Instagram often exaggerate how much better off others are compared with how we might feel about ourselves at the moment. Many studies have shown that too much time spent on social media usually is associated with lower levels of self-esteem, optimism, and motivation while leaving people feeling -- ironically enough -- less socially connected to others.

Use Your Phone in the Way Phones were Originally Intended: The next time you are tempted to use your phone to scroll through social media, scroll through your list of contacts instead. Find someone to call or FaceTime. The happiness you derive from an authentic connection with another person will be far greater than any comments or likes you get on social media.

Practice Gratitude: It's easy to get bogged down with life's inevitable hassles, so make an effort to direct attention to things that are still going well. On the way home from work, fill the time that could go toward ruminating over bad parts of your day with the things that went well. Study after study has shown gratitude to be one of the simplest yet most robust ways to increase psychological well-being.

Identify an important reason why you are resolving to change something in your life (e.g., ""I'm doing it for my kids"" or ""This is to improve my overall health""). Research shows that reminding yourself of how your daily behaviors fit into big-picture goals will keep you motivated to stay on track.

Think about the potential barriers that might get in the way of implementing your goals (you might get lazy, tired, forget or be lured away by another temptation), and then identify contingency plans for how you will respond in those moments: ""When I start getting distracted in the middle of a big work project, I'll give myself a quick break and then remind myself how rewarding it will feel to be finished with it."" Better yet, select environments that are free from distractions altogether. If you know you're always tempted to surf the web while completing work, take your laptop to a place where there's no wifi and leave your phone behind.

Set specific dates and times when you will incorporate the behavior -- when you make a schedule for new behaviors you'd like to incorporate into your life, they require less psychological strength to implement. When you get in the habit of running every Tuesday and Thursday morning, the behavior becomes much easier to initiate because it simply becomes part of your routine, like brushing your teeth or taking the dog on a walk.

Make your goals measurable, break them up into smaller sub-goals, and the reward yourself each time you hit a particular milestone. If your goal is to lose 50 pounds in the new year, treat yourself to a movie or other fun outing for each five pounds you lose.

RTD Ramesh Gandhi has challenged the constitutional validity of section 2(12) of Karnataka Universities Act-2000, stating that it excludes librarians and library staff from the definition of teachers by treating them differentially.

Ramesh, 60, who holds a PhD in library science, is due for retirement on December 31, 2018. He has also challenged the July 19, 2016 notification issued by UoM, prescribing 60 years as the age of retirement for librarians and library staff. The superannuation age of a teacher serving in a university is 62 while for librarians, it is 60. Vinayak B, counsel for the petitioner, argued that librarians guide PhD students, akin to the job of a teacher. An amendment bill, passed by both houses of Karnataka legislature in 2017 to treat librarians on a par with teachers, is awaiting the governor's assent, he said.

Relief for 38 nurses

The high court has passed an interim order directing the Bowring and Lady Curzon Medical College and Research Institute not to terminate 38 staff nurses who are serving on contract basis.

It has been republished from The Quint's archives on the anniversary of the deadly tsunami that hit Chennai in 2004.)

A brown stained building with a roof torn and windows shattered stood in Keechankuppam, a small fishing hamlet in Nagapattinam.

After the tsunami waves had calmed down and people came out of their safe shelters, they were rattled by sight in front of them. It took a long while for families to pick up the broken pieces of their lives and start over. Help poured in from everywhere and people began moving away from the coast into homes built by the government. New utensils and books were bought and memorials were built.

But this school in the village was left abandoned because the building was ruined beyond repair. There was a sense of fear looming over it.

80 children who studied in the school died in the tsunami.

I was 10 when the tsunami struck. We ran away and returned when everything was normal again. I wondered what the school would be like. The then Principal sent word to all friends of the kids who died in the tsunami, so I went to school and my teachers told that most of our friends had died... My best friend Sathyavani too. Even today I cannot forget her face.Kokila, who is now working as a teacher in the same school

Fast forward to 2017 - The school which was once in ruins has been recognised by the Tamil Nadu government as one of the best schools in the state with the highest number of children joining every year.

The Fear Is Real

Situated between the river and the sea, the people in the village feared sending their children to this school again.

The scene of giant waves gobbling up the school haunted them. Gradually, the strength of the school went down to just 92 in 2012, from 428 in 2004.

The school had to be renovated and so a teacher working in a village nearby was called in to give the school a second lease of life.

When the Going Gets Tough

A new school building came up in 2008. But still there were no kids joining school. Balu joined as the Principal of the school in 2013 and he took it upon himself to transform the lives of the children.

People of the village told him that if the school had facilities like no other, then they would fight their fears and send their children to school.

To begin with, he installed a projector and turned one of the classes into a smart classroom. By the next year, the entire school was turned 'smart' and everyone started looking up to Balu's school.

In 2015, 134 kids joined and the school was recognised by the Tamil Nadu state government as the school with the second largest number of children joining school in the state.

To overcome fear, we brought in smart classes and made the school worth coming to. Once the school got the reputation, many children came in. Today, at the cost for 45 lakhs, given by officers and the village, the school has become what it is today.R Balu, Principal

Balu got tsunami ravaged discarded furniture from banks and offices, repaired and polished them. Today, every classroom has tables with drawers and lockers.

Making wealth out of waste, literally, and a small reminder of the hardships they've endured.

Putting Private Schools to Shame

The school today has everything that a private school offers in terms of infrastructure. The classrooms are Wi-Fi enabled, it has science and computer labs, RO drinking water facilities, clean toilets, a huge playground, greenery all around, interactive classes, laptops and even a rooftop garden !

In the book, there will be only one picture, but here we have so much more. We can see places where we can never go in real life. For example, we usually see only one picture of Taj Mahal from the outside, but now we get to see what the roof looks like, what stones it us made of. I want to come to school without bunking a single day. Tamilarasi, Student

They have a recognised Parent Teachers' Association and conduct regular meetings to address grievances. The management works in the way Parliament does - the Principal is the President, teachers are the chief ministers and the children are in charge of departments like sanitation and hygiene.

For the Village, by the Village

The school's transformation was possible owing to the overwhelming support from the villagers, service organisations and government departments.

The village was impressed with the efforts of the Principal and so requested him to give a list of items that they can donate to the school.

Just like a wedding where the family goes on a procession with gifts for their daughter, the villagers prayed at the local temple and walked to the school with fruits, vegetables, tables, chairs, stationery, black boards, skeletons, equipment for the labs and whatever each one could donate.

One of the fisherfolk who didn't have the money to donate, gave a box of chalk pieces as a token of gratitude for building such a remarkable school.

But the Principal has bigger plans - at least five laptops for each classroom, exclusive computer science and physical education teachers, and school buses.

Showering Laurels

The PU school is one among 11 in its category in the State, and 100 in the country, to receive the Swachh Vidyalaya Puraska. The school got the coveted ISO stamp and was honoured with the Kamarajar Best School award by the Tamil Nadu state government.

Balu was awarded the Best Teacher National award by former President Pranab Mukherjee.

Memories Linger On

The school has a memorial set up for remembering those children who lost their lives to the tsunami.

The children who were traumatised by the deaths of their classmates are today serving as teachers in the same school.

Dear children, had you been alive, we would have given you such good education. Today you have not died, you have sowed the seeds of prosperity. Soon the children here will someday become IAS, IFS, IRS officers and you children should bless them all with such big dreams. An ode from Principal R Balu to the children who died in the tsunami

Firstly, it was a shock to hear about the news of untimely demise of Dr. Syed ShujaatBukhari who was martyred by some unknown gunmen around evening on 14 June 2018. My heartfelt condolences to his bereaved family and whole team of Rising Kashmir. His loss is irreparable. May Allah bless his soul!

Shujaat's killing has given birth to Shaheed-e-Sahafat or ""martyr to the cause of courageous journalism"". Kashmir has lost a very professional journalist. An institution has lost its iconic leader. A family has lost its core member.

I personally have lost my guru, my adorable friend, mentor, guide and a great human being.I fall short of words to express my grief on the sad demise of beloved Syed ShujaatBukhari sir.

He was a fearless iconic figure, very good researcher and a nicest human being I have ever come across. He was an institution of journalism in himself. He was very sympathetic, generous and cordial to even an unknown person.

Though I never had the fortune of sitting with him in person, but I could read about him and hear much about him from my journalist friends, that I could easily imagine him as one of the best journalists and researchers of our era.

In January this year, he called upon a meeting for regular contributors to Rising Kashmir. I also got an email regarding invitation. As he always believed in teamwork, love, harmony and brotherhood, the purpose of the meeting was to get known each other well,to deepen the bond of relationship with Rising Kashmir and above all to discuss the issues of common interest.

Though I couldn't attend that meeting, but soon after the conclusion of meeting, around evening I got a friend request on Facebook with profile name Syed ShujaatBukhari. I got so much excited and happy to have friend request from such a great and adorable personality.

Since then, I used to talk with the sir on many occasions. The tweets that he used to share on fb were immensely showing his active presence on social media.

ShujaatBukhari sir is always in our hearts. His worth legacy is roaming all around every corner of the world that he left behind.

In ending week of September this year, the Editorial Board of Rising Kashmir called for another get-together of regular writers to Rising Kashmir. Absence of ShujaatBukhari sir was felt with deep emotions. I remember ab-initio, a writer got down with emotional weeping though he had never met ShujaatBukhari sir in-person. It was the get-together, day after a question about ShujaatBukhari sir was asked in the famous TV show ""KounBanegaCrorepati"" anchored by famous TV Star, Amitabh Bachchan.

Few people in the world of journalism managed to rise above the sky, and have managed to distinguish themselves as exemplary human beings.He was one of those rare journalists.

An excellent journalist, teacher, mentor and the nice soul to scores of people at state,national and international level. He is being sorely missed by everyone whose lives he touched in so many different ways. He would believe that Kashmiri youth are blessed with extra- ordinary talent that they need to explore at world level but there is a crucial need of some unique exploration machinery.

Being Editor-in -Chief of leading local English Daily Rising Kashmir, his writings on politics part of Jammu and Kashmir have been always practical and have a very mesmerizing impact on my thinking towards strong politics associated with Jammu and Kashmir.

His writings reflected belief in political solution to Kashmir conflict. A look into the last few writings gives an idea of his stand over several issues -- be it condemning the social sanctioning of youth turning to violence in the Valley, asking the State to re-think on its methods or urging the Kashmiri society to reflect on the growing violence in the Valley.

Besides, that in one of the last tweets, he was actually defending his journalism, makes his last articles important to understand just what that might be that he was eager to defend.

Describing how worrying the societal sanction for violence in Kashmir is becoming the new normal in the Valley, especially for the youth, and the State's response to it.

From his writings, debates and discussions, we could easily imbibe the idea that he believed in encouraging dialogue as a key to Jammu and Kashmir conflict.

He shuns the ideology of violence of any sort and believed that resolution to Kashmir conflict is only possible through a peaceful dialogue process. He has always been putting his word of truth with honesty, un-biasness, fearlessness and diligence.

I used to read his well - researched articles in Rising Kashmir and could feel a sense of peace of mind, prosperity and positivity. Besides this I could gain in depth knowledge about many issues.

His contributions to Kashmiri art, culture and language has been phenomenal and promising. Being founder of local daily in Kashmiri language Sangarmal and weekly Kashmiri Parcham, his contribution in promoting the cultural,linguistic and ethnic values of Kashmir has been revolutionary.

He used to promote Kashmiri art, culture and diasporic heritage whereever he visited at national or international level. Besides he was also the founder of an Urdu daily Buland Kashmir by which his contributions in Urdu literature has been phenomenal.

His selfless service in saving the lives in 2014 Kashmir floods has been very promising and phenomenal. He was day and night engaged in humanitarian works. His voluntary approach during the floods itself reflects how humanitarian,humble, generous and kind he was. He was a brave heart and best leader.

He had previously spent most part of his 30 years of professional career as the J&K bureau chief of The Hindu. A thorough professional, he was an equally prominent organiser of peace conferences and was also part of the Track II dialogue with Pakistan. A committed peacenik, he finally gave his blood hoping for peace.

The legacy that ShujaatBukhari sir left behind has to be carry forward with passion,zeal and enthusiasm and that is the responsibility of every intellectual or journalist in Kashmir. He was the voice of voiceless. He was the voice of a common Kashmiri.

Now we should believe that his noble voice is alive and we have to inherit that. His left legacy need to be given a real voice to carry forward his message of peace, prosperity, happiness, love, bravery, courage and above all his marvellous journalism."

She, however, urged them to withdraw their strike and join the schools, as students have already suffered a lot due to the long agitation.

Yadav, while addressing media at the state secretariat, said, ""State government is serous over para-teachers' issue and ready for dialogue, as it is the only way for solution of any problem. However, para-teachers should withdraw their agitation before the talk, as the ongoing strike has paralysed the education system in schools.""

""So, their role cannot be ignored but they should also think about future of the school students,"" she said, adding, government understands their problems. ""It has been increased their remunerations at regular intervals,"" she said.

The minister said a TET pass teacher for Class-6 to Class-8 used to get Rs 8,400 a month before 2015. After a dialogue in 2015, TET pass teachers' remuneration increased to Rs 10,164. ""Now, government has decided to give them Rs 12000 a month,"" she said. Similarly, a trained teacher for Class-6 to Class-9, who used to get Rs 8,000 before 2015, would now get Rs 10,000.

She further said a TET pass teacher for Class-1 to Class-5 used to get Rs 7,800 per month before 2015. After the talk with para-teachers in 2015, their remuneration increased to Rs 9, 438. Now, government has increased their remuneration to Rs 11,000.

""Untrained teacher did not get any increment. Government is considering on the issue,"" Yadav said, adding, government is also setting up a corpus of Rs 10 crore for welfare of the para-teachers. Besides, their retirement age was also increased to 60.

The minister further said, ""Since it is an issue related to children's education, political parties should not take advantage of it for mere political mileage. It's a serious issue and all have to cooperate in it.""

Office bearers of Ekikrit Para Sikshak Sangharsh Morcha (EPSSM), an umbrella body of all para-teachers' associations, however, said they would not talk to government until it assured of regularization of services on pattern of Chhattisgarh. ""If government really wants to talk to us, it should invite through a formal letter and government should be ready to meet our demands,"" said EPSSM member Sanjay Dubey.

Trained in Bharatanatyam, Kuchipudi and temple ritual dance, Vyjayanthi has excelled in her various roles of that as a dancer, guru, therapist, researcher, and organiser. She talks about her passion for Kuchipudi, her gurus, young-gen dancers, and rasikas in this chat with us...

From a banker to the stage

I was born in Karnataka and till my mid-20s, I had never watched a Kuchipudi performance. My grandfather, Dr Gubbi Veeranna, was a famous theatre artiste and he used to take his mythological dramas to villages in Andhra Pradesh. He noticed my interest in dance and I started learning Bharatanatyam from the age of six. My life revolved around dance. I was named Vyjayanthi by my dad, who was very fond of actress and danseuse Vyjayanthimala Bali. But, by the time I joined college, I developed a dislike for the art; maybe I had too much exposure to Bharatanatyam. I found theatre more fulfilling and felt that it's a complete art. Later, I completed my studies, chose a career in banking, and got married too. But the life-changing event came when I was 26. I was told that CR Acharya, the famous dance guru, was coming to Bangalore to conduct a workshop on temple rituals. I attended the workshop, wherein using footwork, among other movements, he drew peacock, lion and such vahanas. I was attracted to the technique and impressed by the evolution of the art form. The challenges it posed inspired me to study Kuchipudi. I decided to learn from him. It was providence that he accepted me even though I had not been in touch with dance for about 16 years. He took the effort to come to Karnataka and taught me in the gurukula way.

The challenges

It was a scholarship that changed the course of my life in the dance field. There are 16 families in Andhra who have inherited the art. I went and stayed with them. For them, dance was a way of life. The art resonates with their lifestyles. They lived simple lives and there was no distraction. They had deep knowledge about the dance form and temple rituals. For a city person like me, it was not easy to move out and live this frugal life. But their lives became my lessons and dance seeped into me. It was like, with or without my knowledge, I was imbibing it from my gurus, akin to what a child takes from a mother. And soon, Kuchipudi became part of my lifestyle.

During the early days of my training , understanding Telugu proved to be my biggest challenge. There were no books on Kuchipudi in English. My guru used to write to me in Telugu and I used to wait for the letters like a pining nayika. I would take the letter to those who knew Telugu and get it translated. Similarly, I used their help to reply to him. These letters are my precious treasure as they contain invaluable reflection on Kuchipudi, the result of deep research my guru had done.

I learned from Vedantham Prahalada Sarma, Vedantham Satyanarayana Sharma, Prapoorarna, and Korada Narasimha Rao, among others, to perfect my art form. Meanwhile, I learned Yakshagana, too.

Dancing to bliss

Dance is like meditation for me. I have been a performer for several decades and I have participated in almost all the major festivals in India and abroad. I'm also one of the few dancers to have mastered 'Chitra Natyam', a painting a dancer creates on stage using footwork. There are hardly five to six artistes who can perform this and most of them are Acharya's students. It's highly technical, but very beautiful, too. However, these days, it's not very easy to perform it on stage as the stage and lighting do not lend themselves to the perfection of this art. I was working in a bank for 18 years but it was dance that was always on my mind. For me, dance is like breath; I see dance everywhere-while cooking, walking or travelling. Dance is the energy that fills me.

On Margazhi season

Around 3,000 performances happen in Chennai in this season alone and to me, it's like a miracle. It's unparalleled, and nowhere in the world can one witness such a festival. I have been a regular performer here and I also love the lec-dems and seminars. I have only one concern. Since there are many performances happening simultaneously at various sabhas, people sometimes find it tough to attend their favourite artiste's performance. I wish the season were not restricted to a month, but spread over the year. After all, dance is something the audience should watch from proximity so that they are able to imbibe the emotions and travel with the artiste throughout the performance.

Young generation and Kuchipudi

Our gurus have taken great pains to restore our lost art, de-codify them and give it a regional identity. It was not easy and we had only a few people who dared to take Kuchipudi as a career. Those days, the gurus were much older than their students. My guru, Acharyalu, was about 65 when I started learning. But these days, the age gap is less and the gurus teach as well as perform. I'd say these days we are flooded with dancers. Youngsters these days are very interested in learning classical dances and I have students from abroad, too. I have an open class as well as a gurukula programme in Bangalore, where the students stay with me and learn. The main advantage of gurukula sampradaya is that a student gets to learn the nuances of the art by watching their guru from close quarters. My deep understanding of the art form came from observing my gurus, researching along with them and practising with them. I have so far taught 2,000-plus students and five to six of them are now internationally well known. I think a teacher should be able to identify the student who has the quality to take it forward.

Role of rasikas

I would say that there's been a phenomenal increase in the number of gurus, dancers and rasikas. But there is a drastic need for dance musicians. They still remain very few in numbers and it's a worrying fact. When we talk about young rasikas, I consider it the responsibility of each dancer to contribute by way of his or her performances to create a new set of audience. An artiste should be able to add a new generation of audience for his or her art to survive and thrive. For every dancer, the audience is her energy. Unless those two eyes from the audience are fixed on the dancer asking her to take him or her on a journey, what other joy is there for the dancer?

Tech in dance

It has both advantages and disadvantages. While we had to wait for months or even years to witness the performance of a legend, these days, with the touch of a button, you can watch all of them online. Also, many students now learn online. While tech and social media help create a connection between the artiste and audience, there is also a pitfall. From my experience of being on the selection panel of several festivals, I have seen that on several occasions, a neatly cut slick video of a glamorous dancer can mislead the selectors, thus creating confusion or a possible error of judgment. This is especially critical when you don't have experienced artistes on the selection panel.

Dance as therapy

My guru Acharyalu had discussed with me the healing power of dance. But he never mentioned the word therapy and at that point in time, I didn't understand it fully. He had got the knowledge from Vedic texts and shared how a few karanas have therapeutic value, especially for women. But during my dance journey, I have experienced how dance made me joyful. I explored it further and collaborated with yoga teachers and have held 60 workshops in the UK. Dance is a complete art and the Chaturvida abinaya along with music and its rhythm can definitely make a positive difference in people with disabilities, mental issues, and depression. I had worked with children who have autism, and the results were remarkable. For eg: When given the roles of veera rasa characters, shy and timid people become less inhibited. But it's time-consuming and a highly individualised approach is needed."

The 29-year-old, who has shown his work twice at the Lakme Fashion Week and was named one of the finest GenNext fashion designers, is content to work from Saharanpur and not move to a bustling big city. Mazhar justifies his choice by saying he finds his narratives and context here, he resists accepted notions of a high-profile career, and, above all, has the courage to put this small town on the fashion map of the country.

It all started when as a class nine student, Mazhar set up a boutique with his senior in school. The senior's father had a boutique.

In 2017, Mazhar's first collection, called Dhobi Ghat, evoked nostalgia about his hometown. The washerwoman Sakina Begum, a regular visitor at his home, used to make a small mark on the clothes. The whites of his collection had these marks that Sakina, along with 30 other women, pressed on to the clothes to make a design. The next collection used darn or the craft of the rafugars.

""My inspiration is the Indian artisan, especially those indirectly contributing to the fashion industry like the dhobi or the rafugar,"" he says.

Saharanpur is known for wooden handicraft and Mazhar's family is one of the many engaged in this business. ""Coming from a conservative Muslim family, it wasn't easy to say that I wanted to be a designer,"" he adds.

Today, he runs his label under the national rural employment guarantee programme and more than 70 people work for him. In his design, the visual language is distinctly made up of small-town life and the ways of the artisans there.

Rahul Mishra invokes his village, Malhausi, in his collections on display at the Paris Fashion Week. Just like Mazhar, nostalgia is the primary moving force in his designs too. The broken door, where his mother used to hang a white curtain with its daraz work filtering the afternoon sunlight symbolising a diffused state of being with those white curtains shielding him against the world. His intimate relationship with the things of his childhood-pillow cases, curtains, table cloth, the white of his grandmother's dhoti, the little pond, dew drops and the white and blue checks of the lungis of the weavers and the butchers in his sleepy village in UP-are all part of his storytelling as a designer.

While India's fashion story is shaped by designers who come from little towns and villages and set up shops in Delhi and Mumbai like Samant Chauhan, who is from a small place near Jamalpur in Bihar, or Sanjay Garg of Raw Mango, who hails from Mubarikpur, there is also another set of designers who are choosing to live and work in their small towns and reaching out to the world with their crafts via social media and e-commerce. Like in Kochi, Kerala, 32-year-old Sreejith Jeevan says he is moving towards ""unfashioning"" and it is the joy of slow-paced life that inspires his designs and collections. ""We're moving so fast that sometimes we have absolutely no time for little things such as raindrops and birds.

Though being far from the fashion capital of the country comes with its own drawbacks, there is nothing like the feeling of being home, doing the work you love in a place you know. ""Today, fashion is everywhere and is no longer limited to the metros,"" says Jeevan, who studied at the National Institute of Design (NID), Ahmedabad, and then at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD), Paris. He launched his label Rouka in 2013. ""My stories have a local flavour for a global audience,"" he says.

After the devastating floods in Kerala this year, Jeevan, along with some other designers, helped the weavers of Chendamangalam, near Kochi in Kerala, who had lost their livelihood, get on their feet with the launch of Origins.

""How can my people make fashion for the world-that's what I ask myself,"" he says.

With sustainable fashion and craft becoming the buzzwords of the industry, it is no surprise that designers are looking back at their experiences and creating a new design vocabulary, along with social consciousness and an urgency to be innovative with local crafts and contexts. Take, for instance, Bihar-based social entrepreneur and designer Praveen Chauhan, who set up MATR-Motherly. Luxury. Artistry, a social enterprise in Bodh Gaya, his native place. The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) alumnus collects discarded flowers from the Mahabodhi Temple and transforms them into natural dyes with Kathy Williams, who is from Australia and the founder of 'Because of Nature', a sustainable clothing label. Together, they have founded the Happy Hands Project. ""I always tell artisans that it is your right to expect from us. You are the people who kept our art, craft and culture alive. The artisans have taken me to a different level of creativity. So many people from other countries approach me to study traditional Indian textile and handicrafts,"" he says.

""Thousands of people visit the Mahabodhi Temple every day and offer hundreds of kilograms of flowers. Though this project is at its early stage, we have been able to employ 30 women from the surrounding villages,"" he says.

The Happy Hands Project is an initiative started as a collaboration between the Bodhgaya temple management committee, MATR and Because of Nature to bring sustainable employment to the people through natural dyes on khadi made in Bihar. The project aims to promote the skills of artisans to produce high quality khadi and garments for national and international designers and retail brands that utilise traditional skills.

People used to make fun of him, saying that he was studying tailoring at a high cost after joining NIFT. His father, a contractor, supported him against all odds. Today, Chauhan is credited with reviving khadi, along with other ventures.

Forty-eight-year-old Vijayalakshmi Nachiar grew up in a 'Kutchi' family and was introduced to the world of embroidery and textiles at a young age: Her family had been cotton traders for generations. She graduated in textiles and clothing from the SNDT Women's University, Mumbai.

After marriage, she moved to Pollachi on the outskirts of Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, an agrarian town with a rich tradition of woven cotton sarees.

Her husband started growing ecological cotton through his contract farming initiatives in 2005. And, in 2008, Nachiar set up a handloom studio and co-founded Ethicus in 2009.

""I think I can do what I am doing today with Ethicus only because I come from a small town. This would have been impossible in a big city. I have an in-house production facility and local craftsmen work here. Living in a rural area has enabled us to work from farm to fashion,"" says Nachiar.

When they launched Ethicus, there were very few handloom brands and the challenges were many. ""Customers were willing to pay high price for silk but not for good cotton,"" she says.

Woman Power: Vijaylakshmi Nachiar at her studio in Pollachi

Today, her venture is listed by the textile exchange as one of the few brands worldwide using 100 per cent sustainable raw material and adopting a sustainable method of production. It has been awarded the 'Future Shaper' prize by textiles exchange in 2012 and the 'Pride of Tamil Nadu' award in 2017, instituted by the Round Table of India, as an emerging retail brand.

Naushad Ali's story is similar. ""My dad was a textile merchant and I grew up with all kinds of fabric around me. We used to have bundles of fabric from all over India stocked up in our living room, and I used to help my father tag them all. That was my introduction to textiles and fashion,"" says Ali, 33. Unsure of being accepted as a designer, Ali gave himself five years when he launched his label at Puducherry. ""The lifestyle, landscape, culture and people I meet every day have all been great inspirations for the label and shaped me as a designer. 'Made in Pondicherry' has given me an identity in the industry,"" he adds.

""We are committed to being a sustainable label, with a difference. Being part of fashion, the second most polluting industry in the world, I want to take my decisions carefully and consciously-from the choice of materials to what we make out of them. I believe in slow fashion, creating something that lasts and is also something meaningful,"" he says.

Slow and Steady: Naushad Ali at the beach in Puducherry (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Born in Vellore, Ali spent his growing up years in Chennai and Bengaluru, before his parents moved to Puducherry. He wanted to be an astrophysicist and was also good at botanical drawings. But once he got through NIFT, Chennai, he knew he would do something entirely different.

In 2014, he set up Studio Liam in Auroville to revisit and transfer the expertise of Indian craftsmen to contemporary fashion. His definition of fashion: there is no hurry, there are no seasons, there's only time and commitment. In 2017, three years after he launched his label, he received the prestigious Grazia Young Fashion Award (Sustainable Wear category). And in 2018, he was chosen to represent India for the first IFS biennale at London Fashion Week, 2019, supported by the London College of Fashion and Somerset House.

Pankaja Sethi, 39, spent her childhood at different places-from Itanagar to Chennai-as her father was the chief medical officer with the CRPF. A graduate in botanical science and a NIFT alumnus, after working for export houses, she was asked by a former teacher to help document the folk arts and narratives of Jharkhand. That was the beginning of her foray into indigenous textiles. She relocated to Odisha to help with design intervention and work with tribal weavers.

Rare Tribe: Pankaja Sethi with adivasi women at the Lakme Fashion Week, Mumbai.

It was not an easy task to enrol artisans to create textiles because some of them had fallen in the trap of mass production and many of them did not want to create contemporary concepts, fearing it wouldn't last, she adds.

""Being located in Bhubaneswar, I now see the merits of living in a place that is pollution-free and with much less traffic on the roads compared to metro cities. Moreover, I am close to the weavers and the tribals, who create indigenous textiles and crafts. And, above all, I see the importance of local traditions at the global level,"" she says."

Once again, the year in popular film has been a little underwhelming - with a few exceptions. 2018 has brought to our screens the usual plethora of biopics and films based on true stories, big-budget entries in seemingly endlessly proliferating franchise series, sophomoric indie comedy-dramas and some solid, if minor, genre films. And the year isn't even over yet.

Probably the most notable thing about 2018 was the box-office success of big-budget franchise films and sequels, including films I have no intention of seeing (Deadpool 2, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom; Mama Mia! Here We Go Again, and Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, to name a few) and some still to be seen that look a little more promising (Creed II, Mission: Impossible - Fallout and The Predator, for example).

Here, then, are my top five of the year, some of the more notable disappointments, and a few I am eagerly anticipating.

Luca Guadagnino directed one of the best films of 2017, the elegant, beautifully realised, coming of age film Call Me By Your Name. His remake of Dario Argento's horror masterpiece of 1977 is similarly exceptional. As with Argento's film, the setting is an elite German dance academy run by a coven of witches, but whereas Argento's Germany is a phantasmagoric, expressionistic nightmare-scape, Guadagnino sets his film in a historically acute Berlin, against the backdrop of the actions of the Baader-Meinhof group. The narrative follows the descent of American dance ingenue Susie Bannion (Dakota Johnson) as she realises things are not what they seem at the academy. The film is punctuated with genuinely terrifying moments - the witches are of the scary, rather than Charmed, variety - but it mostly burns along slowly, inviting the viewer to let its hypnotic images and sounds wash over her. The tension then explodes in the final section, and we are confronted with one of the most gruelling, and vibrant, horror sequences outside of Argento.

Like Suspiria, this is a genre film done really well. Co-written by comedian Danny McBride (Pineapple Express, TV's Eastbound and Down, etc.), and directed by David Gordon Green, whose filmography offers a striking balance between outrageous comedy and sombre melodrama, this is, arguably, the best film in the popular slasher series that features masked killer Michael Myers. (The best film in the series, Halloween III: Season of the Witch, is a bizarre and incisive critique of American consumer spectacle, but doesn't feature Myers.) The plot for a slasher film, of course, is not the point - a guy walks around killing people - but the tone of Halloween, with its remarkable seriousness and intensity, effectively engages the viewer. Its sincerity is all the more striking in the context of a 21st century in which popular culture tends to be evaluated through its capacity for irony and cleverness. Kudos to Halloween for reinvigorating the slasher film as a serious genre after it was put to death by the Scream films in the 1990s.

I have written about Leigh Whanell's Upgrade elsewhere but I just can't praise this Australian science-fiction/revenge/action film enough. It borrows styles and themes from key earlier works - Robocop, Cyborg, The Terminator - intensifying and extending these. Genre is never really about originality, so to critique a genre film on the basis that it is formulaic is senseless - the pleasure of a genre film comes through its repetition of earlier affects, sensations, and narratives. What makes Upgrade so successful is its ability to reimagine the old generic tropes so the film feels both pleasurably familiar and dynamic at the same time. There is nothing original about Upgrade's premise - a technological implant malfunctions and the protagonist Grey (Logan Marshall-Green) battles an evil A.I. - but it is handled so skilfully, with compelling and charismatic actors, well-staged action scenes, spare yet visually splendid production design, and an immersive electronic score, that it doesn't matter.

BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee's best film in decades. It is funny, irreverent, and, at times, rather sweet. The true story on which it it based - an African-American policeman imitates a white redneck in order to infiltrate the Ku Klux Klan via telephone - is infectiously outlandish, and Lee develops it in a typically stylish fashion. The film could certainly be criticised on the basis of its confused political and ideological configuration. Can a narrative really make a meaningful statement about structural racial oppression when it features a policeman as the sympathetic protagonist, given the role of the police is to preserve and protect structures as they are? But as a feel-good comedy, it is hard to beat.

Many people, I'm sure, will roll their eyes when they see Skyscraper, a highly formulaic disaster film starring The Rock, in a top-five list, but this is one of the best films of its kind. It follows Will Sawyer, a one-legged security expert, as he tries to save the tallest building in the world and its inhabitants - including his family - from a gang of crooks. Every aspect of the film is extreme - it is extremely loud, mayhemic, silly, exciting and funny. It combines the heightened melodrama of The Towering Inferno with the hard-hitting action of Die Hard to create a viscerally charged cinematic experience. Each disaster film-cliché is amplified to the edge of parody, but the filmmakers manage to pull back enough for us to go along for the ride in good faith. Indeed, Skyscraper seems remarkably sincere. This is cinema as immersive spectacle at its finest.

Solid (if less interesting) films released in 2018 include the wry mockumentary I, Tonya, which, whilst a little heavy-handed in places, offers the viewer a comically wrought true-crime story anchored around charismatic actors and American Animals, another true crime docu-drama. The latter features the real-life criminals onscreen next to their fictionalised avatars and is similarly hilarious in its exploration of a bungled attempt to steal some rare books.

Disobedience, following a budding lesbian relationship in an Orthodox Jewish community in New York City, was one of the most controlled, economically realised films of the year. Its simplicity (and beauty) are quite astonishing. The Kindergarten Teacher is similarly well-made. An agonising, relentless (and hilarious) study of mediocrity, it stars Maggie Gyllenhaal as the eponymous teacher who becomes inappropriately obsessed with one of her talented students.

Other highlights were the thought-provoking, European-American documentary Genesis 2.0; the doleful German-French refugee thriller, Transit; Venom, an enjoyably hard-boiled and unsentimental film that feels more like a minor 1950s science-fiction thriller than a Marvel product, and Hereditary, an uneven but satisfying horror epic. The beautifully rendered Leave No Trace, which follows a father and daughter as they attempt to live off the grid, also deserves a mention.

As a scholar specialising in action cinema, I was very excited about exploitation cinephile Eli Roth's remake of Michael Winner's seminal 1970s film Death Wish - one of the great nasty films of the period. Starring Bruce Willis in the role originally played by Charles Bronson, this film promised to be spectacular. But Roth's vision is much straighter and less challenging than the original and comes across as another mediocre revenge film.

The Commuter saw Liam Neeson reunited with director Jaume Collet-Serra for the third time. I had hoped for another tightly wrought thriller, with Neeson reprising his now signature role as regular guy turned action hero. This one, however, was confusing, tedious, and unconvincing.

Equally disappointing was Lynne Ramsay's, You Were Never Really Here. While atmospheric (and starring Joaquin Phoenix at his bearded best), the narrative fails to cohere in fundamental ways.

The major disappointment of the year was Black Panther. Touted as offering a fresh approach to the superhero genre, it is yet another American consumer-liberal fantasy pretending to be something more radical. The film offers a technocratic vision of the black rights movement, celebrating a racial equality and harmony expunged of all of the violence and messiness necessarily embedded in every struggle for equality.

It stages the decades-old conflict between liberal and radical versions of black activism as the clash between good hero (the liberal) and bad villain (the radical), and, given Hollywood's history of offering liberal fantasy in place of actual social and political critique, this should hardly be surprising. Black Panther is, after all, a Marvel film, so what was I expecting?

There are also several non-franchise films of 2018 that I am keen to see. Bodied, a battle rap comedy produced by Eminem looks ecstatically outrageous, and the biopic First Man, starring Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, may be eminently watchable. Boots Riley's Sorry to Bother You, by all accounts is engagingly nutty, and I am also eager to see Yorgos Lanthimos' The Favourite, the Lizzie Borden biopic (!) Lizzie, How to Talk to Girls at Parties and Action Point, a true story starring Johnny Knoxville about the world's strangest amusement park.

Two melancholic films of 2018 closed out the careers of two great American 1970s movie stars. The Old Man and the Gun stars Robert Redford in his final role before retirement and The Last Movie Star looks like an elegiac swan song for brilliant, epoch-defining Burt Reynolds."

As we passed this test with rainbow colours, we speak to Mr Gay World India 2016, Anwesh Sahoo to share if things have only changed on paper this year. Here are the key lessons he learnt in 2018:

There has been a drastic change in the corporate culture, believes Anwesh since the verdict has come out. Multinational Corporations have started changing their policies to make them more inclusive for the LGBTQ community. Whenever he goes for a job interview, the only question that he is being asked is, 'When can you join us?'

This is imperative given today's workspace is so fast-paced, where employees are doing a nine-to-nine shift, one could actually discover their LGBTQ partner in office. It opens many avenues and provides them with an opportunity to live a dignified, respected life.

Anwesh is proud to inform that he has a boyfriend, Pance Naumov, who is currently a Radcliffe Fellow at Harvard (Well, we all wish we were gay to have a boyfriend studying at Harvard) who no longer shies away from expressing his love for him in public. ""We met two years ago at a Bombay pride parade and since then we haven't stopped talking. Earlier, he wouldn't hold my hand in public and he was very apprehensive because of the culture here"" but now it isn't the same for the couple.

Though, he adds that it might take years for India to build a society where it would be completely normal for us to have a trans teacher at school and taking children to pride parades, the law does matter. The law sends a clear signal that bigotry against LGBTQ community is unacceptable.

Battling taboos and an archaic law around the binary concept of sexuality hasn't been easy for Anwesh. However, he acknowledges himself to be a headstrong person who has learnt to embrace his uniqueness and continues to experiment with life.

For someone who has worn many hats, Mr Gay India has three things to say to his peers:

Best Memory Of 2018: ""I was on a radio show speaking to a variety of people when the verdict came out (September 06) and my phone was flooded with texts from people congratulating and sending love. That was also the first time I talked about my boyfriend on a public platform and that too on a show I have grown up listening.""

Best Place Visited In 2018: ""We were touring with a UK based dance company in India. They needed language assistance and I got to meet four other gay persons who were a part of the dance group. We travelled from Delhi to Bhopal to Jabalpur and Kurukshetra. I had a gala time in Bhopal and Jabalpur especially, trying everything, their food, culture, places. It was the best experience of the year.""

What Do I Look Forward To In 2019: As I enter the second year of my masters programme, I really want to intern abroad this time.

What We Still Lack In LGBTQ+ Realm: We need introduction of sex education in schools in order to build a system where it is completely normal for teachers to take their students to pride parades and show them the LGBTQ culture. This binary concept where we believe pink is not meant for men and a man cannot be effeminate needs to eliminated. Many people had one bad experience with an LGBTQ member which led to the formation of a public opinion.

The 'danger of a single story' which makes or mars a person's experience also needs to be taken care of. A new LGBTQ chapter is opening up in our country and more and more number of people are finding acceptance in the city.

On Representation Of LGBTQ In Digital Medium: I am still waiting for that day when LGBTQ members are represented in a dignified and empowered manner in regular, mainstream films. The fact that the last movie in which we had a gay couple came out a decade ago speaks volumes about the representation of our community in mainstream media.

On LGBTQ Taking Refuge In Dating Apps: I do not support members taking refuge in dating apps because I believe it crushes your ego and it brings your self-pride down. Though, it can vary from person to person.

Going by the bustle, a first time visitor would think preparations were on for Christmas, but regular travellers on the Keezhvelur-Thiruthuraipoondi State Highway know what the frenzy is all about.

Welcome to Keezhvenmani, where survivors and kin of victims of caste oppression are trying their best to put behind them memories of the gory night of 25 December 1968 when 44 Dalits were burnt alive for raising their voice against the dominant community.

Influenced by Marxist-Communist ideology, Dalit farm labourers were involved in a standoff with upper caste landlords. As the night unfolded, riots broke out in which at least 44 villagers, including 16 women and 23 children, were burnt to death in a hut belonging to one Ramaiyan, where the labourers sought refuge to escape the marauding gangs allegedly let loose by the landlords.

""We will celebrate the anniversary on a scale never seen before. For us, the victims are martyrs of Communism who fought capitalism, and not just victims of caste oppression,"" said A Sivakumar, district president of DYFI, and a Venmani resident. It is a race against time as the locals try to complete the new memorial they planned to inaugurate on the 50th anniversary of the massacre. But for the cyclone, the memorial would have been ready well in advance.

Fifty years since the dark night, there is not much development in the village as more than half of the families live in huts. Some of them, including survivors and kin of the victims, though own lands thanks largely to efforts of Krishnammal Jagannathan and her organisation called Land for Tillers' Freedom (LAFTI).

""My husband and I travelled to Keezhvenmani, the day after the incident. The gory scenes and misery broke my heart. I sent my husband back and lived the life of Keezhvenmani villagers,"" said Krishnammal Jagannathan, who is now 92-years-old and lives in Chennai. For three years after 1968, she ate with the villagers and rested with them.

""But, there was still much to do,"" she said.

In the days after the massacre, Krishnammal persuaded the landlords into negotiation and secured 55 acres of land for the victims' kin. G Pazhanivel, now 70, is one among them. He escaped with hack wounds on his left leg and remains the history book of the incident. Though there has not been any other flash point since, elders in the village remain wary.

""Most marriages take place within the caste or community. The children have turned progressive, but we do not have the strength to see any other caste conflict,"" said G Ruthirapathi, a retired school teacher and Pazhanivel's elder brother.

Pazhanivel's children are well educated and inspired several others to follow in their footsteps. While his only daughter is married and settled near Nagapattinam, Pazhanivel's first two sons are marine engineers, and his fourth and youngest son completed PhD and works in a university. His third son came back from abroad to take over farming activity from his father.

On the social front, there is a hint of change. There have been few intercaste marriages in the surrounding villages. The first was a love marriage that took place 24 years ago between N Anbuselvan, a Dalit in Keezhvenmani and R Jyothi, from a dominant caste in Irinjiur.

""It was not easy. Although my wife's family did not object, the others threatened to burn me alive. Thankfully everything became alright,"" says Anbuselvan who now is a Panchayat Secretary and lives in Thevur. The couple has two children.

Meanwhile, at Irinjiur village in Anakkudi Panchayat, the family of Gopalakrishna Naidu, the landlord who allegedly orchestrated the massacre has sought police protection this year, considering this is the 50th anniversary of the incident. Gopalakrishna Naidu was murdered 38 years ago. His brother, Govindaraja Naidu and his four sons died over the years. Only two of Govindaraja Naidu's sons Krishnamurthy, aged 70 and Pappaiyan, aged 63 are alive.

When this reporter visited their house, Krishnamurthy's wife Kirubalini and his nephews were reluctant to answer him and cited health conditions of elders to avoid speaking. Eventually they relented. ""Our uncles do not give interviews anymore, as our words (quotes and television bytes) often get trimmed out of stories, We were projected in such a negative manner that people who did not know us but came for the anniversaries in recent years abused us severely. Our side of the story was ignored,"" said R Senthil Kumar, Govindraja Naidu's grandson.

Krishnamurthy denied his family's involvement in the massacre and said the perpetrators were from Irukkai village. Further, he pointed out that he and a few other land owners still employ farm labourers from Venmani during Samba season.

""In the ten years after the incident, we found it very difficult to find people for farm work. Eventually, we adopted direct sowing method, which is not labour intensive. We continue to employ farm hands irrespective of castes for sowing, weeding, and harvesting. Even during the drought in 2016, we ensured good wages for people who took part in whatever farming activity we could involve in,"" said Krishnamurthy.

The villagers are still affiliated to Communist Party of India - Marxist, very much like their ancestors. The village remained a stronghold of the Left. So is Keezhvelur constituency, under which Venmani falls.

""We will always be loyal to the Communist Party of India - Marxist, as it is those principles which taught us to stand against oppression and persecution,"" said U Selvaraj, a Venmani resident.

Pazhanivel sighs at the sight of the dilapidated memorial which was built in the place where Ramayan's hut stood, two years after the incident.

""I was fortunate to see the daylight. I now wish to see a more revived Keezhvenmani with developments such as social harmony rural development, education, self-employment, and standard of life before my time is up.""

The warmth of love harbours relationships

And home is where humanity dwells

Never found respect in that house... but only disrespect

Never had a moment of happiness... but just gloom

So much, so that I begged for my death to the almighty

However, he never let me have that wish

Because our friendship was destined to be

He never let me have that wish

Because I had to see my daughter succeed

The moment had brought back joy in my life

[My daughter cleared the grade VII scholarship exam]

I came across a person on this turn of life

Who gave me a whole new hope to live

And a day came when I forgot everything and dissolved into you

... And I still cherish the memories of that day

-- Jivhala (Translated from Marathi by Vishakha Ghadi)

These are the lines from a thank you note written by Suvarna Maskar who describes it as 'the moment of awakening'. ""Maybe because I didn't know what to do [sic]. I spoke everything,"" she says with a sigh of relief. The note is a conversation from 2008 which the 46-year-old Suvarna had with Jadhav ma'am, a Government school teacher in Shirgaon village of Satara's Wai taluka in Maharashtra.

The note was a build-up of two decades. A farmer and a home-maker, Suvarna always wanted to complete her education. She dropped out after grade X. ""During that time, girls were rarely sent to school and I also faced the same,"" she recollects. ""I felt like I had lost everything in the world.""

Tired of her routine life which had cut her freedom, she would often pray for death. Once while bringing her children back from the school, she conveyed everything to Jadhav ma'am and felt 'liberated'. Later, she wrote a thank you note which became her first ever work of poetry. ""I didn't know what a poem was,"" she remembers.

A week later, she went to the school again for the parents meeting. A school teacher praised the thank you note publicly. Immediately, Jadhav replied saying that Suvarna is a 'big poet'. ""That was the moment when I felt I could achieve something in life,"" she says with the widest grin.

Challenges while writing

After the incident, she started exploring the art form. Within a fortnight she wrote a handful of poems. ""No one believed that I had written them. People used to ask me how a farmer can be a poet?"" she says. A lot of fellow villagers even falsely accused her of plagiarism.

""In the initial days, even my husband didn't believe that I could write poems. Once after coming from the field, I wrote a poem in front of him. From that instant, he has never doubted me,"" she explains. Her husband, Uttam, 53, is a farmer and knows about all her poems. ""I like her poems and enjoy listening to them,"" he says proudly.

Earlier, she was scared of showing the poems to school teachers and editors of the newspapers. ""My husband would proudly show them to the editors,"" she says. This restored her lost confidence and soon Suvarna herself began meeting with the school teachers and editors. ""This happened only when my husband understood the importance of my poems. He would always take me to various poetry competitions in other talukas of [Satara] district,"" she explains.

Some of the awards which Suvarna won in the past eight years

Her first poem was published within a few months in 2008 in a Marathi daily Pudhari. ""That's when people started believing me,"" she asserts. Her mother in law isn't a big fan of Suvarna choosing the path of poetry. ""She would always taunt what you will do by becoming a poet.""

Suvarna is now a regular contributor to Pudhari, Sakal, Gramodhar, Nave Shahar newspapers, and Gumfan, Muktagiri, Amrutgat, Pudcha Paul, Lokjagar, Laxmiputra, Sarvoyda Vichar magazines in Marathi.

Suvarna has maintained an archive of all her poems which have been published in newspapers to date

""Now, people's perspective has changed. They have started recognising me as a woman farmer poet,"" she says proudly. There are still a lot of challenges ahead. ""People aren't very receptive of romantic poems, but I don't pay attention to what they say now."" She loves writing poems on love and is breaking the conservative barriers with her romantic poems now.

It's not just the orthodox society which Suvarna has been battling, she has to complete the majority of the farming work first and then pursue her passion for poetry. Every day she wakes up at five in the morning, completes her household chores, milks her two animals twice and then leaves for farming at 10 am and returns by 6 pm. They own 2.5-acre land where they cultivate sugarcane, jowar, and a few vegetables.

The art of poetry and inspiration

She has a plethora of topics in her repertoire. Some of them include agrarian crisis, alcoholism, addiction, children, rural life, societal issues, women, patriarchy and romantic poems.

In the school days, she was fascinated by the names of authors and poets in the end [of every chapter and poem]. ""I always wanted my name to be published under a story or poem,"" she recalls. ""We live our lives only once and I want to leave behind a legacy.""

""I don't feel like I've to sit back, think and then write poems. It happens naturally,"" she says. All her poems come from the field and personal experiences. Citing one such experience, she narrates her long story titled Gurakhi [Shepherd] from 2017 which was published in the Diwali edition of Laxmiputra magazine. The story is a fictional conversation between the local hill and a shepherd regarding the environment degradation by human beings. Some of her poems are reactions to the wrongdoings and crimes in the society. The Kopardi [2016] rape incident deeply affected her and she expressed the anguish in the form of a poem.

Talking about dealing with criticism, she says, ""Only a poet can understand the happiness behind the written word [in the poem]."" She credits her childhood reading habits for the huge vocabulary she has built now. Her elder brother Suryakant Yadav is a voracious reader. ""He would always get me a lot of books from Mumbai,"" she recalls smilingly. Her father, the late Babanrao Yadav would always read aloud spiritual books. ""Those interesting mythological stories made me fall in love with books,"" she says. ""When I read my poems to him, he had tears in his eyes.""

Her mother, Yashodabai, now in her early 80s, could never see the steps of the school. ""She always supported me and said that one day, these poems will liberate me and take me forward,"" says Suvarna proudly.

Inspiring others

Suvarna is now invited in various gatherings at the schools to recite her poetry. ""I am restricted to places from where I can return the same day,"" she says sadly. ""I've to milk the animals every day."" She is optimist enough to find a solution to this and pursue her passion of poetry full time. Suvarna's dream is to present her poetry in several villages across Maharashtra. ""I want to use poetry as a means of community development,"" she tells me as she talks about the coming poetry competitions and conferences she's looking forward to.

She has won around 30 awards for her poetry in the past eight years. She has also recited her poetry several times on All India Radio, Satara. Suvarna has handwritten more than 500 poems and filled four diaries in eight years penning down her experiences. She has also written 15 long stories.

Hand written stories and poems of Suvarna Maskar

In 2013, her first book titled Suvarngandh [a smell as precious as gold] which is a collection of 46 poems was published by Akshara Publication, Satara. The book covers a wide range of topics like addiction, societal awakening, women's issues, agriculture, romantic poems, etc. 500 copies of the books were printed. ""I can't afford to get any book published right now,"" she says. ""But in a few years my next books will be published,"" she says confidently.

Suvarna likes the work of the late Bahinabai Chaudhari, a woman cotton farmer from Jalgaon district. ""People didn't have confidence in me, but I was self-confident to become a poet,"" she says smilingly.

Her first book Suvarngandh was published in 2013 which is a collection of 46 poems

""I've four teachers at home,"" she says proudly referring to her children and husband who have been inspiring her to keep improving her poems. Her daughter Neelam, and Akshada, both are engineers and are working currently. Her youngest son, Tejas is pursuing his Bachelors in Pharmacy from Karad city in Maharashtra.

""The reading habit amongst people has come down. We would be able to keep our independence only if we are well read and informed,"" she says.

Interesting anecdotes

Her poems transcend books and schools and have now become an inherent part of her life. Once she was seeking a dental treatment in Pachwad village. ""During the times I had to visit the doctor, I used to observe his work carefully and later wrote a poem on him."" This was published in a local newspaper. The dentist loved it and later visited Suvarna to thank her. ""He also used better quality caps for my teeth without charging any extra money,"" she says smilingly.

She met Jagdish Khebudkar, a renowned Marathi littérateur and lyricist in the Akhil Bharatiya Sahitya Parishad's conference in Mumbai in 2010. ""He spoke to me about his struggles writing Lavanis for the Pinjra movie [1972] and how he overcame his fear. He also asked me to keep writing more poems,"" she says. That moment was an inspiring feat for Suvarna. ""Whenever I feel like giving up, I remember moments like these,"" she explains.

Looking back at her struggle, she pauses for a while, smiles, takes a deep breath and says, ""I never imagined that my life will ever change.""

Nothing like a little tongue-in-cheek humour to start your Sunday, right? Well, G. Sampath hears you and then raises you his column for The Hindu. Taking a dig at the OTT weddings of the past weeks, Sampath tells you why the Ambanis who spent a mere 0.03 per cent of their net worth on their daughter's wedding should be an example to the Indian middle class who exhaust their life's savings for the same purpose. While he's at it, Sampath- on a completely unrelated note- also takes a dig at the hundreds (at last count) cities that have been renamed this year (because, why not?!) and finally ends by telling you who made that famous dhokla that Amitabh Bachchan was seen serving at the Ambani-Piramal wedding. Read this column because we could all do with some good old satire in our lives!

Those of you who read me regularly and fantasise about the day I become a wealthy editor-CEO adept at parlaying his journalism into political influence would know that I harbour no such ambitions. This is why you'll never catch me taking selfies with the Prime Minister or with any of the clueless, powerless ministerial panjandrums who every day set a new benchmark for jobless girth.This is also why I try and stay away from high-profile weddings. Alert readers will remember that the last celebrity wedding I attended was the Virushka one in Italy, and as I explained in this column exactly a year ago, I only went because they wouldn't stop weeping on the phone. But this year I made it clear to both Priyanjonas and Deepiran that Mahalingam must go to the mountain if he wants the mountain's blessings because the mountain will not go to Mahalingam. G. Sampath in The Hindu.

Discriminating Against Migrants Isn't Just Unconstitutional, It's Also Bad Politics

In his weekly column for The Times Of India, Swaminathan Aiyar talks about the increasing trend of 'othering' migrants in different states- a trend that has been bolstered by political parties across the spectrum. Notwithstanding the fact that this is severely unconstitutional, Aiyar argues that it could also cost these parties politically. He cites the example of Gujarat where the BJP government is drafting a law forcing new projects to hire at least 80 per cent of their workers from within the state and says that this may alienate migrants from, say, Uttar Pradesh, who will elect 130 MPs to the Lok Sabha in 2019, as opposed to the 30 that will be elected from Gujarat.

Rabindranath Tagore dreamed of an era when ""the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls."" Alas, both the Congress and BJP are energetically building such narrow domestic walls.Article 15 of the Constitution says, ""The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them."" Neither Narendra Modi nor Rahul Gandhi, Vijay Rupani or Kamal Nath, can wriggle out of that. Kamal Nath protests that, whatever the Constitution may say, in practice many states have special benefits for locals, so he is following what others have long done. This amounts to arguing that because many people violate the Constitutional ban on discriminating based on religion, caste, sex or place of birth, therefore state governments are entitled to do so too. No, state governments are supposed to enforce Constitutional rules, not break them. Swaminathan Aiyar in The Times Of India

Justice, Forgiveness, And The Call To Forget

Forgive, and forget? Well, it's not that simple as Rajeev Bhargava explains in his column for The Hindu. What is forgiveness? Is it excusing a wrong? Is it compromising with evil? Or is it acknowledging the transformation of a wrong-doer from the side of the wrong to the side of the right?

These are heavy existential questions, but Bhargava breaks them down succinctly to ensure that you get your brain juices flowing this Sunday morning.

The reception of the recent judgment 34 years later once again demonstrates that victims of one-sided collective violence desperately need retributive justice, and not be deviously nudged to move on without it, to let bygones be bygones, to forget and forgive. Not surprisingly, it is perpetrators of violence or insensitive bystanders who say this. But forgetting is neither possible nor desirable. Traumatised survivors may be forced into silence but they can't forget their loss or suffering. For a start, forgetting can't be brought about intentionally; no one can wilfully strive to achieve amnesia. The more one goads oneself to forget, the more one remembers the brutality of the act and the loss of loved ones. More importantly, such a demand can't be morally justified. Rajeev Bhargava in The Hindu.

Taking On The Chowkidar, One Funny Tweet At A Time

In the context of Rahul Gandhi, the only thing more talked about than the upheaval of his political fortunes, is his upheaval on social media. In his column for The Times Of India, Abheek Barman talks about Gandhi's social media strategy and how he's taking on the Prime Minister with the one thing he arguably doesn't have: a sense of humour. Barman looks into some of Gandhi's tweets from the past year which have garnered more support than that of the Prime Minister and asks a pertinent question in the end- "" Will @narendramodi become India's first PM to be laughed out of office?""

Every voter, everywhere is used to political fibs. So about a month ago when Rahul said that if elected, state Congress governments would write off farm loans in 10 days, folks yawned. Then on December 19, he tweets: ""It's done! Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh & Chhattisgarh have waived farm loans. We asked for 10 days. We did it in 2."" RT, 17,000. L, 71,000. And a panicked stampede ensues among BJP rulers of Assam and Gujarat to whitewash Rs 600 crore bad debt and Rs 650 crore unpaid power bills out of account books.Rahul steers clear of ghoulish snarls of the pearshaped Right. He gives wide berth to otiose quavers of the weedy-Left. He lacerates the powerful for neglecting, abusing and lying to those who gave them power to begin with. To take on vampire gau-rakshaks, he'll have to take down holy cows. Using humour to bite instead of abuse to bludgeon. Abheek Barman in The Times Of India.

Out Of My Mind: Bankrupt Economics

While Rahul Gandhi's debt waiver for farmers has earned him a lot of political brownie points, it does not seem to have found favour with Modi-admirer-turned-critic Lord Meghnad Desai.

Lord Desai in his column for The Indian Express calls Indian agriculture ""the sick man of the Indian economy"" and goes on to explain how decades of bad agrarian planning has brought agriculture to this situation today. He argues, therefore, that instead of being all filmy about farmers and their debts, politicians must try and rehabilitate farmers into other sustainable professions so that there are no debts that need to be waived off in the first place.

A little extreme, some would say, but we would ask you to hear him out.

Political attitudes are like old Bollywood films. They love cliches. Villains have moustaches and mothers are always full of tears. Farmers are forever poor. They are supposed to deserve our sympathy but even more the taxpayers' money. If you are a low-income earner, as an urban worker or a struggling school teacher, do not ask for debt forgiveness. If you have a mortgage and cannot keep up with your EMI, do not expect your bank or the government to cancel your debt. Not even if you are an MSME producer. Politicians have no sympathy for you. Come back as a kisan and tears well up in their eyes and you get a cheque straightaway.Lord Meghnad Desai in The Indian Express

Inside Track: Flying Baraat

So you thought that the delay in selecting the Chief Ministers of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh was because of political reasons? Well then in her latest column for The Indian Express, Coomi Kapoor rubs a big LOL on your face. Apart from the politics, there was also the correct 'muhurat' as Kapoor points out and also the time that it takes to put together a political baarat.

So who were the baraatis and how were they different from the regular invitees? Kapoor breaks it down for you.

The first auspicious day after the result declaration was 17 December, the preceding five days are termed as 'panchak' and considered inauspicious according to the Hindu calendar. The three oath-taking ceremonies, in Bhopal, Jaipur and Raipur, were all held on the same day, and Rahul Gandhi took a jumbo party of a few senior Congresspersons and leaders of various alliance partners to each venue. The convoy of planes, a six-seater, an eight-seater and an 18-seater, belonged to Kamal Nath, the Jindal group and a leading industrialist of Andhra Pradesh. The CMs of each state waited for Gandhi and his contingent to arrive before taking oath. Some southern MPs were surprised at the unpunctuality since they are accustomed to chief ministers being sworn in at a very precise and carefully calculated timing, both for superstitious reasons and for meticulously adhering to the official programme. After being sworn in, Ashok Gehlot and Sachin Pilot did not even proceed to their offices to take charge, instead they flew to Chhattisgarh with the rest of the Gandhi entourage. Coomi Kapoor in The Indian Express

Five Major Political Trends From 2018

Well, its that time of the year again- the time when the year finally ends, we mean- and any observer of Indian politics will agree that 2018 has set the perfect platform for an exciting General Election in 2019. In the weekly column for the Hindustan Times, Chanakya talks about these impending elections and the five major political trends that seemed unlikely to form in the beginning of 2018, but have come to the fore (and how!) as the year draws to a close. From Rahul Gandhi finally establishing himself as a force to reckon with, to the resuscitation of Mayawati after the Uttar Pradesh election debacle- here's a summary of what went down in Indian politics this year, and how 2019 is now open-to-all.

At the beginning of the year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), despite scraping through to win Gujarat in late 2017, was still on a high. The opposition, especially the BJP's main rival, the Congress, appeared in tatters. The BJP looked invincible, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi seemed a shoo-in for 2019.Modi may still be the most popular political leader in the country as the year ends, but a lot of other things have changed.The BJP is now in power in five fewer states than it was at the beginning of the year. The air of invincibility that once surrounded the party is gone. The Congress is resurgent. Through the year, it has held Parliament to hostage, belying the fact that it won a mere 44 of the 545 seats in the Lok Sabha in 2014. Chanakya in the Hindustan Times

Reviewing 2018: The Year Of India's Sporting Revolution

Politics is not the only thing that underwent a sea-change in 2018- so did India's sporting scene. In his column for the Hindustan Times, Kunal Pradhan says that this has been a 'watershed year' for Indian sports.

From Hima Das, to Shubhankar Sharma, PV Sindhu and even the Indian Men's cricket team which is now being led by a quartet of menacing fast bowlers- 2018 has been about young Indians starting their journey in global sports at a level where other Indians before them hoped to finish their career. 2019 promises some more of these sporting revolutions, says Pradhan, because unlike players of the past, these prodigies have not been swept away by their success- but see it as just the beginning of what they have set out to achieve.

The story goes that, this July, a young woman in Helsinki, Finland called her father in his village in Dhing, Assam, to tell him that she was now a junior world champion. The dad, a farmer, to whom the import of the achievement didn't immediately sink in, told her it was late and he would think about what she'd said in the morning. Hima Das, 18, told her father that he would not have any time to think in the morning because he would be too busy giving TV interviews.A couple of months before that, at the World Golf Championships in Naucalpan, Mexico, a young man approached the legendary Phil Mickelson during a practice session ahead of the decisive final round of the tournament. Mistaking him for a pesky journalist, 'Lefty' shooed him away: ""Not right now, after the round."" It look Mickelson a few seconds to realise that the young Indian before him was Shubhankar Sharma, 21, the 54-hole leader and his playing partner in the final group that day.These two sporting anecdotes, related several times over the last few months, are important to retell as we bid goodbye to 2018 because they underline why this has been a watershed year for Indian sport.

Paratha Vs Pepper Chicken: The Dabba Divide Is Growing

We leave you with this piece by guest contributor Sonam Joshi for The Times Of India, where she talks about the changing dynamics of one our most beloved childhood memories- the tiffin dabba. In these times when the vegetarian versus non-vegetarian debate has taken the country by storm, what implication does it have on school children who, alien to this conundrum, unassumingly and innocently share their dabbas with their fellow classmates?

Well, remember that time when your fellow strict-vegetarian-at-home Jain classmate secretly gorged on your salami sandwich at lunchtime, unbeknownst to this parents? Let's just say that may be a thing of the past now.

For generations of school students, tiffin boxes have been a reason to bond during the lunch recess, taste unfamiliar regional and community dishes, and simply swap their boring dabba with a classmate's tastier one. This lunchbox-fuelled camaraderie even inspired Amol Gupte's 2011 film Stanley ka Dabba, where students share their tiffins with a classmate who can't afford to bring one. Yet, the humble school tiffin is increasingly at the centre of a vegetarian versus-non-vegetarian food divide, with several schools issuing rules and guidelines for what's inside lunchboxes, especially for students from junior classes.Sonam Joshi in The Times Of India

It was in 2010 that Delhi's Shri Ram School Maths and Computer Science teacher Sujata Sahu first went on a trip to Ladakh. It was a solo trek, and on the third day, she began to face extreme difficulty breathing and walking. The low oxygen in the altitudes as high as 16,100 feet had given her Pulmonary Edema.

She needed to rest, and with the help of two passing trekkers, she decided to spend the night at a remote village --

""A village which has no road access, is reachable only after a day's walk, and one which boasted of just one home with three occupants. I had neither medicines, nor the ability to call my family, nor access to medical care,"" says 50-year-old Sahu, a resident of Gurugram.

In was in these conditions that she saw two tiny schools which totally changed her life.

The first primary school -- Sku-Kaya -- had five students and two teachers. It had two rooms which were being rebuilt. While one teacher had stayed in the village, the other had gone to Leh to get uniforms and mid-day meal supplies for the school.

The second school had eight children and three teachers. It was two of them who had stopped to help Sahu when she was feeling sick. They had been walking back to Leh for textbooks and uniforms

The children were being taught from English books, which was very alien to them as they had no electricity or TV or telephone connectivity and thus, had no idea what the outside world was like. Having never set foot out of their villages, the exposure level of these children was very low.

.In Ladakh, even the summer months were bitingly cold but that didn't stop the kids from coming to school to learn. ""One of the children even brought his little brother along, who was barely two years old and the love and care with which all the children and the teacher took care of the child was a lesson for me,"" says Sahu.

What really hit her on that fateful Ladakh trip was the sheer drive of the Ladakhi people there to keep growing and improving their circumstances.

""Their determination to come to school and learn, the eagerness of the teacher to learn something new to teach his students, and the aspiration of the parents to educate their children was my inspiration to drop everything and help these amazing people,"" says Sahu.

From a regular school teacher to Ladakh's 'Iron Lady'

""My experience with the schools in Ladakh gave me a path to follow, one that I knew I could contribute to,"" says Sujata Sahu, who had spent 12 years in the corporate world before starting to work with children.

But she had been working at the Shri Ram School for just two years at the time, and leaving this job was the hardest decision she had to make in her life.

""I was planning to take on a seemingly herculean task, in possibly one of the toughest terrains of the world. I had no idea about where I would get the funds from and was also not very clear on how much of an impact I alone could make,"" she says.

Moreover, no one had done something like this before her in Ladakh. But thankfully, she found with herself two strong founding partners -- her husband, Sandeep Sahu, who had been trekking in the region for almost 35 years, and Dawa Jora, a Ladakhi businessman, all of whom had the strong conviction that something like this was really needed for the region.

In 2011, unable to find other NGOs to partner with, the three founders went on a three-day trek to one of the most isolated villages in Lingshed (in Ladakh), carrying 1500 kg of education material on 25 horses, and crossing three mountains at extreme temperatures as low as minus 15 degrees.

The treacherous and steep pass they crossed at an altitude of almost 17000 ft inspired the name of the '17000 ft foundation'.

As she started off on her mission to provide Ladakh schools with the right resources to further the education of their students, she realised this wouldn't be very easy.

""One of our biggest challenges was convincing corporates that even remote areas with extremely scattered and small populations needed support,"" says Sahu.

For the first two years, the foundation worked only with the founders' own funds and kind contributions of friends and family members.

""Though no non-profit organisations were willing to take on Ladakh as a region, we were given support in the form of knowledge, pedagogy and even a large donation of books for our first 100 libraries,"" she says.

Sujata Sahu's undying passion to help the people of Ladakh earned her the nickname of the 'Iron Lady'.

How Ladakh poses a unique set of education problems

India is a geographical anomaly as it has every type of topographical setup, each of which comes with its own challenges. This makes it extremely difficult for the government to cater to every type of problem that can arise in this vast country owing to accessibility issues, extreme weather conditions etc.

Ladakh has almost a 1000 schools across Leh and Kargil, spread across 60,000 sq km of harsh mountains. Catering to a school going population of under 40,000 children, the average school strength of these schools is barely 25 students across the two districts, explains Sahu.

Teachers themselves come from remote villages and have to travel long distances for training, school supplies and even basic administrative functions, leading to long absences and shortage of staff, she adds.

Also, ""While teachers are given basic residential training during winters as well as in-service training, most of the trainings are not contextualized for the uniqueness of the Ladakhi education system,"" she says.

The extreme weather also adds to the problems with schools being shut for severe winters for three months in a year when the roads become inaccessible due to thick snow and temperatures as low as minus 35-40 degrees.

""Incredibly, despite the remoteness of the region, every little hamlet which has even 10 school going children has a tiny government school with teachers in attendance, thanks to the local administration. A little wonder then, that 89% of the schools in Ladakh are govt schools with the private schools present in just a handful of the larger villages,"" she says.

""What is commendable is that all these 900 plus schools are functional and have qualified teachers in attendance. What is even more remarkable is that every child in every village goes to school, managing to at least complete middle school,"" Sahu adds

However, it is only the larger villages which have middle schools and after passing class 5, children have to walk around two hours to get to school to continue their education. Public transport isn't available in such terrain and the army provides army vans for commuting.

.Despite the presence of these govt schools, the community here wants a better life and quality education for their children so they can get better jobs. This aspiration makes them send their very young children, often as young as three years old, to be enrolled in private schools, often extremely far away from their homes.

""Cut off from their villages and parents for months in a year, these children grow up in dormitories, hostels or with other families. Lacking the care and guidance they need in their growing up years, this leads to large-scale dropouts and a population of youth who are unable to go back to their villages,"" Sahu explains.

17000 ft works in these remote villages by improving existing govt schools so that parents would have faith in them and stop sending their children away so far that it disconnects them from their roots.

How voluntourism is helping 17000 ft foundation grow

Sujata Sahu started her non-profit organisation with just the founders and a few volunteers who were given the task to survey the entire length and breadth of Ladakh.

The team mapped around 600 schools after a seven-month-long study. Some of these schools had been bomb shelters during the Kargil war and the buildings had to be shifted multiple times.

The success of the volunteer programmes helped the foundation grow and each of these schools has been geo-mapped for travellers to find.

""We, very early on, piloted our volunteering programmes to involve outsiders in the work of our organization and to also understand if people could be encouraged to donate to such a cause. The enthusiasm and support shown by complete strangers told us that we were on the right track,"" says Sahu.

""Our volunteers, who are our brand ambassadors, then carried the story of our work into their workplaces and CSR then became our main source of funding. Voluntourism, as it is called today, still forms a good 25% of our annual budget and helps us maintain our backend costs,"" she adds.

Why playgrounds are so important in Ladakh schools

Though the govt schools all over Ladakh have proper buildings, they lack the proper facilities that make a school a happy, joyous and welcoming place for children. And in a remote location with rugged ground, a playground comes as a blessing.

""In these remote villages, where nothing is available, there are absolutely no options for children to play with. Though these schools have well-qualified teachers and very low pupil-teacher-ratio, parents often judge the performance of a school based just on the facilities they provide,"" says Sahu.

Thus, parents see the existence of a playground in govt schools as a very good incentive to not send away their kids to far-off private schools.

""Today, 17000 ft foundation has setup playgrounds in 140 schools with colourful swings, slides, see saws etc. many of which the team had to carry over horseback for days to reach our remotest schools,"" she says.

Solving the problem of no native language storybooks in Ladakh

A big aspect of Ladakh education that surprised Sujata Sahu was how the kids learned in English medium schools even though they have no exposure to the foreign language. Their native language was Bhoti.

""To add to this burden, children also have to study their local language as well an additional Hindi/Urdu from grade 1,"" says Sahu.

To enable the children to read better and get comfortable with the number of languages they have to deal with, 17000 ft set up libraries in 230 schools with simple and easy to read story books in English, Hindi and Urdu.

""However, sadly, there are absolutely no story books in Bhoti for children to read. Sensing this gap, we undertook a mission to translate storybooks from English to Bhoti.""

""In 2015, we launched our first phase where we translated 21 titles and published 21,000 storybooks for distribution into 300 schools,"" says Sahu.

This year again, the organisation not only translated another 20 titles, but also added illustrations and changed narratives to make them more relatable to the children of Ladakh.

What has 17000 ft foundation achieved so far?

In the span of just six years, Sujata Sahu's organisation has accomplished much.

""Today, 17000 ft works with 250 govt schools across Leh and Kargil and we are already seeing a reverse trend of children coming back from private schools back to the govt schools in their villages,"" says Sahu.

The organisation has set up libraries in 230 schools, playgrounds in 140 schools, and trained over 1500 teachers in various methodologies with a team which is in Ladakh every winter for training teachers.

17000 ft foundation has conducted multiple community workshops in 125 villages with over 10,000 villagers contributing to our workshops and programmes in the schools.

Recently, the organisation electrified and digitized 120 schools in Leh and Kargil, providing solar electricity and tablets with customized digital learning content, a TV, and a server to provide offline data syncing.

The DigiLab project is the non-profit's most ambitious programme bringing offline hybrid digital learning solutions to the remote villages.

The well-furnished digital labs supported by workshops from the team throughout the year can help the students learn independently with guidance from their teachers.

How crowfunding is helping 17000 ft foundation

Crowdfunding is increasingly coming up as a very important resource collection measure.

""17000 ft has been involved with ImpactGuru.com in multiple projects, the latest being the funding of a Playground for a very remote school in Kargil. We had also fundraised for our Bhoti Book Translation project through ImpactGuru.com and managed to raise more than we needed,"" says Sahu.

Fundraising platforms are great for helping nonprofits fund small projects that have tangible goals and timelines. It is an excellent way to help get the word out to potential supporters and garner more support for the non-profit, says the Iron Lady of Ladakh.

Future of 17000 ft foundation

Before 17000 ft was established, there was little or no attention on the remote schools of Ladakh, and today with all our work and efforts and the participation of the local communities, govt schools are looking and performing better and we are seeing a reverse trend of children coming back to their villages and govt schools.

""When we started, one of our biggest challenges was encouraging donors, volunteers, foundations and even corporates to focus on remote regions of Ladakh. Today, however, we are confident that our model is working and we can get the support we need,"" beams Sahu.

Sujata Sahu now wants to take this model to other remote and mountainous regions, like Arunachal Pradesh, or the remote areas of Himachal.

""We feel that we are closer now to our vision of a better life and education for all children, regardless of geography or terrain,"" she says.

There is no doubt that the school education sector is beset with huge problems. However, whether the dismal performance is on account of policy gap or there are other factors that are responsible for the current state of affairs is a moot point.

Let us first try to understand what has not happened in the education sector. Why has it not happened? And, how can it happen (whether through policy intervention or otherwise)?

Two things have certainly happened during the current millennium. The infrastructure (school buildings) has shown remarkable improvement though there is still a long way to go. And, thanks to the mid-day-meal, we have managed to get the child to the school.

However, what is appalling is the poor quality of education that is imparted in most of the government schools. This is evidenced by the fact that the learning outcomes have actually come down during the past decade despite enormous amount of investments. The number of teachers has gone up substantially and the average pupil-teacher ratio comes close to the required levels.

However, this does not solve the problem of quality. To begin with, a large number of teachers are not qualified to teach, yet they are teaching. According to a rough estimate, out of eight million teachers around 1.4 million fall in this category. Politics has seeped into this cadre in the most insidious manner resulting in skewed distribution of teachers in most of the States as the tendency is to hang in and around urban areas.

The Right to Education Act did precious little on this front. In fact, the legislation made the task of delivering quality education complex and difficult. The focus of the Act is primarily on 'inputs' (like infrastructure) rather than 'outcomes'. It has created an adversarial role between 'public' and 'private' schools. The Act mandates under Section 12(1)(c) that even private schools ""shall admit in Class I, to the extent of at least 25 per cent of the strength of that class, children belonging to weaker section and disadvantaged group."" The manner in which reimbursement is to be provided has created a number of problems.

The norms and standards prescribed in the schedule for a school are far removed from ground reality. What is perhaps desirable has been made mandatory. This has resulted in a phenomenal increase in the number of teachers. During 2015-16, there were 39,608 government schools that had less than 10 children but each school was mandated to have minimum of two teachers.

The budget private schools, most of whom are doing a great job in imparting education, are under enormous pressure to meet the prescribed standards or face closure. No attempt was made while enacting this legislation to look at the ground reality.

The consequences have been disastrous. On an average, an amount of around ₹10,000 per child gets spent in government schools. The budget schools do it for much less and impart as good, if not better, education. Unfortunately, the focus so far has primarily been on regulation (legislations are perhaps meant for that) and not on development of the private sector. Consequently, even after eight years of enactment, the country is none the better than what it was.

The RTE Act has done more damage to delivery of education. Section 16 of the Act provides that ""No child admitted in a school shall be held back in any class or expelled from school till completion of elementary education.""

The 'expulsion' part can be understood but not holding back a child in a class has meant that a large number of children are getting promoted without acquiring the necessary attributes. The model of 'no detention' was apparently picked up from the West and transplanted in this country without taking into account the objective conditions obtaining here.

Yet again, the consequences have been devastating as there is a huge bottleneck getting created at Class X where the pass percentage has plummeted. The States were not even given freedom to take a call on the issue. The government has subsequently decided to provide an option to the States and the amendment is under consideration of Parliament.

A new Education Policy is round the corner. However, what needs to be understood is whether there is a need for a policy to address the issues that afflict school education. Most of the action relating to education lies in the States. In any case, the country is too diverse to consider a single mandate by way of policy for the entire country. If a teacher does not go to a school in Kerala, he could well be ""lynched"" but in some of the States of northern India, they consider it their right not to go to the school. There are instances of these regular teachers employing a ""substitute"" to represent them and even teach on their behalf.

What is actually required is an action plan clearly outlining: What needs to be done? How it will be done? Who will do it? And, by when it will be done? The roles of respective entities should be clearly defined so that the performance can be assessed. One has often wondered why should only the Centre assess the performance of States? Why can't it be the other way round?

The action plan needs to focus on the teacher who plays a pivotal role in imparting education. The entire value chain needs to be looked at, understood and interventions clearly outlined. Beginning with pre-service training, to selection process, to in-service training, to transfer and posting, to engagement of teachers in non-educational activities, to their promotional avenues and morale will need to be looked at.

An action plan for each State will have to be worked out in detail, clearly outlining the roles of the Centre and the respective State government. Intervention for each State will vary from State to State. Unlike the present dispensation, there will have to be sufficient flexibility in the central schemes to accommodate the differences among States. The whole approach has to be outcome based rather than input based as has been the case so far.

Our country has been obsessed with the western world. We had looked at Finland, England, Scotland, Holland and all the lands of the world but not at motherland. A lot of wonderful work is being done within the country but has so far gone unnoticed. ""Policy"" cannot help in this regard.

What needs to be done is to facilitate identification, understanding and scaling of successful practices. If these home-grown practices have succeeded in the prevalent objective conditions, the chances of their replication and scaling are pretty high as compared to an 'imported' idea or practice.

What is also required is to learn from States, like Rajasthan, that have turned it around through some remarkable State level interventions both administrative and financial.

Policy debates provide food for intellectual stimulation but what matters is what is done on the ground. Hence, the dire need for an action plan."

But where to find them? Deal, no deal or even another referendum?

While #Brexit has dominated much of public debate and Government time, #Metoo and #gigeconomy have also featured prominently in public debate though they are assigned to the Government's growing list of ""future legislative reform needed if we just had time"" pile - shame JK Rowling couldn't make Hermione's time turner a reality.

The Government has repeatedly stated that it intends to maintain current UK employment laws so that existing workers' rights are unchanged following exit day, this could of course change, as political fortunes change ('Fantastic [Brexit] Beasts: the [G]rimes of Grindel[gov]'). The reality is that it is unlikely the Government will change its mind and repeal all EU-derived employment law or make large-scale changes to employment law in the aftermath of Brexit. There may be scope to tweak some provisions within the current legislation, but political considerations make it relatively unlikely that core employee rights would be reduced significantly following Brexit.

John Whiting, now CBE, is the writer's personal favourite taxman for this simple and honest statement, which continues to be true. Like last year, determining worker status in modern workplaces has once again been a hot topic in 2018.

Back in February we finally saw the delayed Government Response to the recommendations of the Taylor review of modern working practices; and the answer to the tricky employment status issue is...more consultation and thinking!

The Government has rejected Matthew Taylor's recommendation for introducing a 'worker status by default' presumption and is instead revisiting the possibility of a new statutory test to determine employment status. As acknowledged in the latest consultation which closed on 1 June, codification of the test for employment status would involve trade-offs. On the one hand, a simple and clear formula will give more certainty. On the other hand, the current case law based framework provides the nuance and flexibility often needed when applying the test to different circumstances which are inevitable in the labour market.

Ultimately, employment status is a complicated subject because employment relationships are just that - complicated. A status test set down in legislation rather than case law doesn't change that fact. Trying to encapsulate the nuanced factors developed over years of case law into legislation will be no easy feat. But have the courts been any more helpful this year?

Since the 2016 landmark tribunal decision (and 2017 Employment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) judgment) that Uber drivers are workers (despite Uber's best efforts at drafting bamboozling contractual clauses) there has been a seemingly endless supply of successful new claims predominantly concerning couriers [Insert your choice of courier company name and you will most likely find a case].

In June, the Supreme Court delivered its judgment in Pimlico Plumbers Limited & Anr v Smith on whether a plumber who was self-employed for tax purposes was nonetheless a worker for employment law purposes. In relation to the personal service requirement for establishing 'worker' status, the Supreme Court confirmed that a limited or occasional power of delegation could still be consistent with personal performance. The 'dominant purpose' of the contract remained one of personal service.

The Supreme Court's judgment significantly decreases the importance of the right of substitution as a determining factor. A substitution clause in and of itself does not magically prevent worker status. On the other hand, integration in the business appears to be a factor of increasing importance in the current wave of worker status cases.

The Supreme Court has tweaked the judicial test by succinctly articulating the 'dominant purpose' factor. But this is more judicial test evolution rather than revolution. Unfortunately, for hopes of world peace, arguments over the required elements of worker status are far from over. Whether and to what extent 'mutuality of obligation' between assignments is relevant to a person's status during assignments is still up for grabs. 'Mutuality of obligation' is a crucial factor to establish 'employee' status, but is it required and if so, to what extent, for establishing 'worker' status? As the Supreme Court said there is no easy answer to this question and it will have to await appraisal on another occasion.

The further appeal in the Uber case was heard by the Court of Appeal on 30 and 31 October. Will the judgment, when handed down, provide an answer? No doubt whichever way the judgment goes, the losing party will further appeal.

Unfortunately, we are not much closer to tackling world peace!

Last year in Jones v Birds Eye, the employment tribunal reminded us that following the 2013 EAT decision in Moran v Ideal Cleaning, the number of agency workers potentially falling within the provisions of the Agency Workers Regulations 2010 was significantly lower than originally anticipated. Following Moran, not all agency workers are protected; it is only those supplied to work temporarily. Those placed indefinitely (meaning open-ended in duration) are not placed 'temporarily' and are therefore outside the scope of the Agency Workers Regulations (AWR).

In both Moran and Jones the agency workers were found not to be temporary and so not covered by the AWR. Conversely this year in Brooknight Guarding Ltd v Matei we have an example of an agency worker placed temporarily. The EAT agreed with the tribunal, that while a relief security guard mainly worked at one site, it was as a 'cover security guard'. Each 'as required' assignment was on a temporary rather than on a permanent or indefinite basis.

In Kocur v Angard Staffing Solutions Ltd, an employer breached the AWR in providing an agency worker with fewer enhanced contractual days' holiday and shorter paid rest breaks than comparable permanent employees, despite the agency worker receiving a higher hourly wage. The EAT rejected the defence that the agency worker's higher rate of pay offset his inferior holiday entitlement and rest breaks - the AWR require a term-by-term comparison not a package approach.

For a part-time worker to establish less favourable treatment under the Part-Time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2000 (PTW) they need to identify an actual full-time worker comparator who is: employed by the same employer under the same type of contract and engaged in the same or broadly similar work having regard to level of qualification, skills and experience.

In Roddis v Sheffield Hallam University, the EAT considered what constitutes the 'same type of contract' for PTW purposes in the context of a claim by an employee working under a zero hours contract. The University argued that a lecturer's zero-hours contract was not the 'same type of contract' so he could not compare himself with a full-time lecturer on a permanent contract of employment.

A good academic try? Well no. The EAT had no trouble in rejecting this argument. It cannot be that a zero-hours contract of itself constitutes a different type of contract for the purposes of the PTW, since the consequence would be that an employee on a zero-hours contract would never be able to compare themselves to a full-time worker. As the EAT points out, if a contract of employment containing a zero-hours clause was a distinct type of contract under the PTW, the PTW would be self-defeating.

Back in June 2013, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 was revamped. Significant new provisions were introduced. The changes included introducing co-workers' liability for victimisation with corresponding employer statutory vicarious liability.

In November, the Court of Appeal in Timis and Sage v Osipov confirmed that an individual's personal liability for detriment which they cause to a whistleblower colleague can extend to liability for that colleague's dismissal. Where a distinct prior detrimental act done by a co-worker results in the whistleblower's dismissal, the whistleblower can still recover compensation for losses flowing from the dismissal - a so-called 'dismissal consequent on detriment' claim. In this case, it leaves two wrongdoer directors on the hook for just over £2 million of losses, the employer company being insolvent.

For there to be a qualifying disclosure under the whistleblowing legislation, there must be a disclosure of information, not a matter of opinion or an allegation. In practice, information and allegations are often intertwined. In June, the Court of Appeal clarified that the question is whether the disclosure has ""sufficient factual content and specificity"" (Kilraine v London Borough of Wandsworth).

This year we have also learnt on the whistleblowing front:

Common law vicarious liability is a principle of strict, no-fault liability for wrongs committed by another person. In an employment relationship, an employer may be liable for the wrongs committed by an employee where there is a sufficient connection between those wrongs and the employee's employment. This is a very long-standing legal principle with the foundation of the 'modern' principle going back to 1912 (Lloyd and Grace, Smith and Co). But have 21st century developments expanded its scope?

Following a number of appellate level 21st century judgments, when considering whether an incident has sufficient connection with the employer, it is not merely a question of whether the employee was 'at work' in a strict sense. Instead it is whether the employee was otherwise 'clothed in the employer's authority' or ''acting within the field of activities assigned to them'.

For example, an employer was liable for a Managing Director's violent assault of a colleague at an impromptu post-Christmas work party after-party as the MD 'chose to wear his metaphorical managing director's hat' at the time of the incident. Another employer was vicariously liable for a data breach by a rogue employee as access to the data was within the field of activities assigned to him. The fact that the rogue employee's actions were designed to harm the employer was irrelevant.

July saw the Court of Appeal hand down one of the most significant judgments of the year - a combined judgment in Royal Mencap Society v Tomlinson-Blake and Shannon v Rampersad t/a Clifton House Residential Home. In a single judgment, the Court of Appeal has effectively overturned the precedent value of numerous EAT judgments concerning the treatment of 'sleep-in' shifts for national minimum wage (NMW) purposes.

Where a worker is required to work a number of 'sleep-in' night shifts at the employer's premises (to be available in case of an occasional emergency but otherwise expected to sleep all or most of the shift), does the full night shift constitute 'working' for the purposes of the NMW? The Court of Appeal has now answered this question ruling: ""the only time that counts for NMW purposes [during sleep-in-shifts] is the time when the worker is required to be awake for the purpose of working"".

Quite simply the only time that counts for NMW purposes is the time when the worker is required to be awake and actually carrying out work. Time spent sleeping/relaxing does not count. Factors previously found to point towards NMW being payable for the entire sleep-in shift are now irrelevant. The sleep-in exception in the NMW Regulations applies to cases where ""the essence of the arrangement is that the worker is expected to sleep"".

Turning to on-call time for Working Time Directive purposes, until this year Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) case-law has tended to focus on the worker's location during stand-by periods and whether it is at a place determined by the employer. Early this year, in Ville de Nivelles v Matzak, the CJEU considered whether on-call time is 'working time' for fire-fighters on-call at home but with a duty to respond within eight minutes. The CJEU has held that such time is 'working time'.

Perhaps a bit counterintuitively, this judgment still reaffirms the importance of proximity to the workplace. In this case, the obligation for the firefighters to remain physically present at the place determined by the employer (their homes) and the 'geographical and temporal constraints' resulting from the requirement to reach their place of work within eight minutes, limited the opportunities which the firefighters had to devote themselves to their personal and social interests. The situation of the firefighters in this case could therefore be distinguished from that of a worker who, during his stand-by duty, must simply be at his employer's disposal inasmuch as it must be possible to contact him. While being on employer premises during on-call time is not required, the proximity of the worker to the workplace at a place determined by the employer (even if it is the worker's home) is still a key factor.

In what is now a perennial favourite, holiday leave accrual, carry-over and pay calculations have once again featured heavily over the year.

Working out holiday entitlement for term time only workers, casual and zero hour workers can often prove to be an administrative headache. The Working Time Regulations (WTR) require holiday pay to be calculated on the basis of the average hours worked in the preceding 12 weeks immediately before payment is made. However, many employers have instead worked out holiday pay by using a 12.07% of annualised hours shortcut as set out in ACAS guidance (5.6 weeks is equivalent to 12.07% of hours worked over a year for a full time worker).

While the 12.07% method is accurate in many cases, it isn't always. In March, the EAT in Brazel v The Harpur Trust confirmed that calculating holiday pay for variable hour, term-time workers based on 12.07% of annualised hours is incorrect. The express provisions contained in the WTR cannot be overridden for ease of calculation. As shown in Mrs Brazel's case, the shortcut did not work accurately for part-time term time workers. Employers using a 12.07% of annualised hours calculation as a shortcut need to review their holiday pay calculation practices or face potential claims.

In Gomes v Higher Level Care Ltd, the Court of Appeal was asked whether compensation for failing to provide rest breaks can include an injury to feelings award. If yes, this would significantly increase the value of rest break breach claims.

The Court of Appeal has confirmed that compensation for claims for failing to provide rest breaks does not extend to injury to feelings, being akin to a breach of contract claim.

While compensation for failure to provide rest breaks and annual leave does not extend to awards for injury to feelings, not all WTR claims are excluded. In contrast, compensation for injury to feelings may be awarded in working time detriment claims since they are more akin to a statutory tort (South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service v Mansell & ors).

We have also had yet another EAT judgment on overtime and holiday pay calculations. The EAT in Flowers and others v East of England Ambulance Trust, once again confirmed that for a WTR claim ""normal pay"" is that which is ""normally received"". Focusing on whether overtime is or isn't ""voluntary"" is irrelevant. The key is regular receipt. But also check the contractual provisions. If there is a contractual right to have overtime included, there may not be a need to establish a regular pattern. In Flowers, regardless of the WTR claim, the claimants were entitled under a contractual clause to have any overtime pay received in the preceding three months included in their annual leave calculation whether or not the overtime worked was part of a regular and settled pattern.

In two German references, Kreuziger v Land Berlin and Max-Planck v Shimizu, the CJEU held that a worker who does not apply for paid annual leave during employment does not automatically lose the right to an allowance in lieu of untaken leave on termination. The worker must have been given an opportunity to take that leave. While employers are not required to force workers to actually exercise their right to take paid annual leave, a bit of nagging may be needed. It is for the employer to show that it encouraged the worker to do so, while informing them, accurately and in good time, of the risk of losing that leave at the end of the applicable reference period.

The CJEU has confirmed that the Working Time Directive (WTD) does not require holiday leave accrual during the taking of parental leave (Tribunalul Botoşani v Dicu). Parental leave (in the UK 18 weeks' unpaid leave to care for a child) is distinguishable from sickness absence and maternity leave. If national law suspends the employment contract during parental leave, then annual leave entitlement does not accrue during the taking of that parental leave. Parental leave is not equivalent to a period of actual work for determining the duration of paid annual leave.

In the UK, legislative provisions which apply to maternity, paternity, adoption and shared parental leave expressly state that during the leave period the employee is entitled to the benefit of all the terms and conditions of employment except remuneration - so holiday leave accrual continues during these leave periods. However, there is no corresponding legislative provision in relation to EU law derived parental leave.

If an employer unilaterally imposes a contractual change, it is possible for employees' agreement to be implied if they continue to work without protesting after the change has been imposed. But this is risky. Careful analysis of all communication from employees (both verbal and written) is necessary to ensure nothing has been communicated that suggests or evidences objection to the changes. Where the change imposed does not have immediate effect, silence would not be considered to be agreement simply as a result of the passage of time.

In April, the Court of Appeal in Abrahall and ors v Nottingham City Council reminded employers just what risky business it is to assume agreement. In this case, the Court held that a group of employees who continued to work following their employer's imposition of a pay freeze did not agree to a variation of contract. Although the employees did not bring tribunal claims until two years later and did not individually communicate protest, they had protested through their trade unions at the time. The employees continuing to work could not be taken as unequivocal acceptance of a change that was wholly to their disadvantage. A decision by the union not to take industrial action over the imposed change did not equate to accepting the variation.

Also in April, we received Supreme Court clarification on when contractual notice of termination served by post takes effect (Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Foundation Trust v Haywood). In the absence of any specific contractual provision, contractual notice takes effect only when the employee personally takes delivery of the letter containing the notice (so not date recorded delivery signed for by a family member). In this case, the date of termination was crucial because it determined whether the notice period expired on or before the employee's 50th birthday, which affected her pension entitlement by some £200,000.

This judgment now aligns the contractual law position with the statutory position in respect of the effective date of termination (EDT) under the Employment Rights Act 1996.

Lesson: when dismissing an employee, it is usually best to inform the employee in person (written confirmation being simply that, confirmation, and not the mode of first communication of the actual decision). This will remove any ambiguity about the date of dismissal.

From this year's crop of unfair dismissal judgments we have learned:

A head teacher's failure to disclose to school governors a close personal relationship she had with a registered sex offender was misconduct justifying dismissal (Reilly v Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council - Supreme Court). This judgment is of particular note as Lord Wilson questions how useful is the long-standing Burchell v BHS reasonableness test, but without reaching a conclusion. The Supreme Court has, in effect, invited argument in a future case.

Misconduct does need to necessarily amount to gross misconduct for a fair dismissal. There is no magic in labelling something as gross misconduct rather than as serious misconduct for unfair dismissal purposes. As ever, each case will be fact specific to determine whether the employer acted reasonably in treating that reason for dismissal as sufficient to justify dismissal (Quintiles Commercial UK Ltd v Barongo - EAT).

The deemed extension of the effective date of termination by statutory minimum notice does not apply where the employer is entitled to immediately dismiss (summary dismissal) by reason of the employee's conduct (Lancaster and Duke Ltd v Wileman - EAT)

An employee's letter giving 'notice' was not an unambiguous resignation. The context for the letter was that the employee was expecting to take up a different role in another department (although that role was subsequently withdrawn) and the tribunal was entitled to read it as giving notice of intention to leave a particular role rather than to terminate employment (East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust v Levy - EAT).

Where an employee is contractually entitled to receipt of Permanent Health Insurance (PHI) payments, absent any over-riding express terms, the courts will imply a term preventing an employee being dismissed where this would deprive them of the benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled under the PHI scheme. While an employee may use the implied term in a breach of contract wrongful dismissal claim, tribunals must not allow that breach to automatically dictate its conclusions on unfair dismissal. Having said that, breach of the implied term will still be a very important relevant factor when assessing fairness (Awan v ICTS UK Ltd - EAT).

It is automatically unfair to dismiss an employee for taking part in the activities of an independent trade union. Union officials who are also employees will lose this protection where they are found to have acted wholly unreasonably or maliciously in carrying out their functions. But where is the line drawn?

The Court of Appeal confirmed a trade union official was automatically unfairly dismissed despite misuse of confidential information. In the Court's view, it is not uncommon for a union representative to be given, without soliciting it, information that he or she realises has been obtained without the owner's consent. Although it might be said that the only correct course in such circumstances would be to decline the information or destroy it, the court was 'not here concerned with an ethics seminar'. Instead the key question was whether the very limited way in which Mr Morris made use of the obviously illegally obtained information (forwarding it to HR and insisting on a meeting to discuss the contents) was a 'sufficient departure from good industrial relations practice to take his conduct outside the scope of 'trade union activities' .

The Court held the line had not been crossed. At most, some sort of warning for storing and not deleting the information might have been appropriate. The official's conduct was not outside the scope of 'trade union activities' and he was therefore entitled to the statutory automatic unfair dismissal protection (Morris v Metrolink RATP Dev Ltd).

On the tax front, since 6 April the way that termination payments are taxed has changed. All payments in lieu of notice are now treated as earnings subject to tax and class 1 NICs. Effectively, employers are required to subject to tax an amount equivalent to the employee's basic pay (as defined in the new rules) if notice is not worked. However, planned changes making termination payments above £30,000 subject to class 1A NICs (employer liability only) have been postponed even further to April 2020, which is good news for employers.

While case law on transfers of undertakings has been relatively quiet this year we have had some interesting cases and some rare examples:

A renewed warning that if a parent company takes over the day-to-day running of the business of a subsidiary, this may result in a TUPE transfer of the subsidiary's employees to the parent. Significant care should be taken when a parent company decides to show more of an interest in the business of its subsidiary (whether following a share acquisition or otherwise). If the parent starts making decisions and issuing directions in a manner which suggests that it has assumed control of the subsidiary, it could inadvertently become the employer. In Guvera Ltd v Butler a parent company learned that lesson at some considerable cost, with awards for failing to inform and consult on the intra-group transfer amounting to £3.5 million having been made to the numerous claimants in this case.

European case-law in line with existing UK case-law that a temporary cessation of activities prior a transfer does not necessarily prevent the existence of a transfer of undertaking (Colino Sigüenza - CJEU).

A reminder that in assessing whether there has been a service provision change (SPC) to multiple new providers, the effect of fragmentation must be considered when identifying the relevant activity. In some cases, the way a service is carried out post-transfer will be a relevant consideration in determining whether the activities are fundamentally the same as those carried out by the outgoing contractor. It is important to assess the issue of fragmentation early on in the analysis, because in some cases the fragmentation will be so acute that it will no longer be possible to say that there has been a service provision change (London Care Ltd v Henry and others - EAT).

EAT guidance on the meaning of 'undertaking', 'economic entity' and 'administrative function', which is rarely seen in domestic cases. A useful round-up of case law (both domestic and European) in relation to services or entities performing functions within the public sector (Nicholls and others v London Borough of Croydon).

A rare example of a permitted change to terms and conditions following a TUPE transfer. A transferor was not prevented from withdrawing a travel time allowance. The genuine reason for its withdrawal was that it was outdated and unjustified, not for a reason related to the transfer (Tabberer v Mears Ltd - EAT).

It was hard to miss that on 25 May, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 came into force introducing a raft of important changes to the data protection regime. Key changes include:

In July we received Court of Appeal guidance on the balancing test needed when dealing with a ""mixed data"" Subject Access Request and when a third party objects to their data being disclosed (B v General Medical Council):

Although the decision concerns the DPA 1998, it will continue to have relevance under the DPA 2018 and GDPR regime.

This year employers are reminded that checking references given by applicants is an important part of any recruitment process. Especially where experience equates to safety, doing so is critical.

In Francis-McGann v West Atlantic UK Ltd, a pilot applied for a captain position with a freight airline. He falsely claimed to have previously worked as a captain and gave as a referee Mr Desilijic Tiure - in hope that the reference would never be checked. The pilot was appointed as a captain before his references were checked and provided with training based on him already being an experienced captain.

The person who initially decided to hire Mr Francis-McGann was clearly not an obsessive Star Wars fan. When his references were checked, it became obvious that Mr Desilijic Tiure was fictitious, being Jabba Desilijic Tiure, better known as Jabba the Hutt of Star Wars fame! However that was merely the first Episode.

After being summarily dismissed, Mr Francis-McGann brought a tribunal claim for three months' unpaid notice pay! The tribunal had no qualms in dismissing his claim and allowing the employer's cross claim for recovery of training costs in accordance with a contractual clause in the sum of £4,725. The force was clearly not with Mr Francis-McGann.

In July, the EAT gave a warning to prospective employers considering withdrawing a job offer following the receipt of an unsatisfactory reference criticising an applicant's levels of absence in their previous job without first considering whether there was an underlying disability.

In South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust v Lee a prospective employer was liable for discrimination arising from disability when it withdrew a job offer after receiving and relying upon two unsatisfactory references. One of the references was unduly negative and inaccurate because it heavily relied on disability-related absences. The tribunal found the discriminatory reference had more than a minor influence on the new hirer's decision-maker. As such, it did not matter that the non-discriminatory reference may in and of itself have been sufficient cause to withdraw the job offer (although this may be relevant when awarding compensation). Lesson - consider references critically to assess whether any adverse comments in references may relate to disability necessitating follow-up enquiry.

Do employers need to match enhanced maternity pay for fathers taking Shared Parental Leave (ShPL)?

Early in April, the EAT in Ali v Capita Customer Management confirmed that it is not direct sex discrimination for employers to offer 14 weeks' enhanced maternity pay but only statutory ShPL pay.

While this case is in line with Government guidance and the traditional view, it is notable that Mr Ali's case concerned an enhanced maternity pay period of only 14 weeks which happens to be the minimum maternity leave period required under the EU Pregnant Workers Directive. As such, a question mark remains where enhanced contractual maternity pay period exceeds 14 weeks.

While we received at least a limited answer on the question of direct sex discrimination (subject to a pending appeal), the question of indirect sex discrimination is still very much up for grabs. Three weeks after the EAT handed down the Ali judgment, the EAT handed down its related judgment in Hextall v Chief Constable of Leicestershire Police.

In Hextall, the same question was considered through the prism of an indirect discrimination claim. In this case the EAT held the original tribunal incorrectly analysed the question of comparators and also failed to correctly identify the particular disadvantage. The case was therefore sent back to the tribunal. The question of indirect discrimination continues to be unresolved and we wait a further tribunal decision (determined on the correct legal basis). Like Ali, Hextall too is subject to a pending appeal.

While large private sector equal pay claims against several large supermarkets are making their way through the tribunal system and the usual endless preliminary issues, this year we have learned:

'Discrimination arising from a disability' is still a relatively new concept first introduced by section 15 of the Equality Act 2010. Over recent years we are gathering a body of case-law on the intricacies of this concept which involves the employer treating the employee ""unfavourably because of something arising in consequence"" of the employee's disability. Section 15 entails two distinct causative issues: The first involves examining the employer's state of mind: did the unfavourable treatment occur because of the employer's attitude to the relevant 'something'? The second is objective: is there a causal link between the disability and the 'something'?

This year we have learned:

In Donelien v Liberata UK, the Court of Appeal reassures employers that they can rely on the advice of occupational health advisers in determining whether an employee is disabled, so long as appropriate questions are raised and further clarification is sought where necessary.

An employer does not necessarily need to take every step possible to establish whether an employee is disabled in order to avoid having constructive knowledge of disability. The test is what an employer could reasonably be expected to know. In this case, the employer had not relied solely on an occupational health report stating that the employee was not disabled. It had also taken into account 'return to work' meetings and letters from the employee's GP. An employer's efforts need not be perfect and, in the circumstances, the employer had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the nature of the employee's illness and could not reasonably have been expected to do more particularly when dealing with an uncooperative employee.

To establish an indirect discrimination claim, the employee will need to show that the employer applied a ""provision, criterion or practice"" (PCP) that puts, or would put, those of the employee's protected group at a particular disadvantage compared to other groups. In Carreras v United First Partners Research, the Court of Appeal held that an expectation that an employee would work late does not have to be presented as an instruction to cause a disadvantage. If the disabled employee can establish the existence of a long-hours culture, this may be enough to amount to a 'practice' under the Equality Act 2010.

In Colt Technology Services Ltd v Brown, the EAT decided an important point regarding the effect of PHI on discrimination compensation, where the employee has had the opportunity to choose different levels of PHI cover through a workplace flexible benefits scheme.

The EAT considered the 'insurance exception' to the general rule that claimants should only be compensated for actual loss. The policy behind the exception is that an employer should not be able to benefit from an employee's prudence in taking out insurance, and so insurance pay outs are not set off against the employee's financial losses in those circumstances. In the context of a flexible benefits package - where an employee can choose the level of their insurance benefits in exchange for foregoing extra salary - this principle must be apportioned. The portion paid for by the employer without the employee foregoing extra salary will be offset (in this case 50%) and the portion for which the employee had foregone extra salary will not (in this case an additional 25%).

In relation to a claim for unlawful victimisation under the Equality Act 2010, ""giving false evidence or information, or making a false allegation, is not a protected act if the evidence or information is given, or the allegation is made in bad faith."" But does an ulterior motive for making a victimisation claim show bad faith?

In Saad v Southampton University Hospitals NHS Trust, the EAT confirmed that honesty not motivation is key. The primary question for victimisation purposes is whether the employee has acted honestly in giving the evidence or information, or in making the allegation, that is relied on as a protected act. The existence of a predominant ulterior motive, while potentially relevant, is not the focus of the enquiry. In this case, just because the allegation was raised as a means to deflect criticism during a performance process did not automatically mean it was done in bad faith.

In Unite the Union v Nailard, the Court of Appeal reminds employers that harassment can be committed by inaction was well as action. Failure to act in relation to third party harassment which is brought to the employer's attention, may itself amount to harassment. If the reason for the failure to act was influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the relevant protected characteristic, then that failure to act may itself amount to harassment. Employers should ensure that they train staff on dealing with harassment issues, make it clear that harassment from suppliers, clients and customers is not tolerated and keep clear records of issues arising.

In Bakkali v Greater Manchester Buses, the EAT point out that in harassment claims, context is a crucial element. Conduct ""related to"" a protected characteristic (in the test for harassment) is wider in scope than conduct ""because of"" a protected characteristic (in the test for direct discrimination). It requires a broader enquiry, involving ""a more intense focus"" on the context of the offending words or behaviour.

The Holy Grail: financially sustainable access to justice.

Following last year's abolition of tribunal fees by the Supreme Court, the number of claims has been steadily increasing. While the number of individual tribunal claims overall has not yet returned to the pre- 2013 introduction of the fees regime level, we have reached an important statistical milestone. September's quarterly statistics revealed that single-claim receipts are, for the first time, at a higher level than when fees were first introduced.

While the number of claims is set to rise over the near future, the Ministry of Justice in November announced that a new fee regime ""balancing tribunal funding and access to justice"" was ""in development"".

Four years after the introduction of mandatory ACAS early conciliation (EC) we finally have appellate level confirmation on how to apply the 'stop the clock' provisions. In April, the EAT confirmed the widely accepted view that the time limit to present a claim should always be extended by the number of days it takes to complete the EC procedure (Luton Borough Council v Haque).

There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

To inculcate the concept of banking and savings in children, a teacher in a primary school of Bareilly has set up a 'school bank' that is run by students and is meant to meet their stationery requirements during their stay on the campus.

To run this bank, students voluntarily contribute Rs 2 each while teachers also willingly make donations. There are 320 students in the Primary School, Pipariya in Bhojipura block of Bareilly district.

""This money is used in buying pencils, erasers, sharpeners, rulers, few books and kept in a cupboard in the principal's room, which they call green counter. Earlier, when students forgot to bring stationery, they used to go home to bring it, and in the process, often missed the class,"" explained assistant teacher Saurabh Shukla who has introduced the concept.

But all these are things of past. Now, on a day when students don't bring their pencil box, they don't go home. Instead, they walk into the 'school bank' and are allowed to borrow the same at zero interest for a day, he said.

Due to availability of stock in the 'school bank', the students are able to continue with their studies without any hindrances. The class also does not get disturbed. However, while going home after the school gets over, they are required to deposit the same back in the 'school bank', which is managed by students, said the teacher.

One Nikhil, a Class 5 student, has been appointed as manager of the 'School Bank'. But a teacher will assist him. ""The school teacher explained the concept. Everybody was convinced that it will be of great help for everyone. After whatever little money we could raise, teachers opened their wallet and heart to bridge the deficit. The school bank is now doing wonders,"" said Nikhil.

The 'School Bank' follows simple rules. Students of any class may avail the facilities of this bank. If a student fails to bring any stationery, he is not required to go back home and bring it. He just has to go to the bank, make an entry of the borrowed item in the register and attend class.

In case a student misplaces the borrowed item, he is supposed to give it back to the bank within 30 days. ""But below poverty line students are exempt from this rule. Students will be allowed to borrow things twice a week and seven times a month so that they do not make borrowing a habit,"" said Rinki, a student of the school.

The 'school bank' manager will be appointed from a senior class at regular intervals. Candidates with good academic record will be considered for the job, said the teacher.

The basic education department has appreciated the initiative of the school, and if found feasible, the same can be replicated in other schools too, said an official.

New Delhi: Private schools in India have over 20 lakh seats reserved each year for children from the economically weaker sections (EWS) of society, but only 20 per cent of them get filled, a report by legislative rights group Indus Action has revealed.

Under Section 12 (1) (c) of the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, 25 per cent of seats from private, unaided schools are reserved for EWS children. However, over the years, many schools and even state governments have not taken the Act seriously.

States like Delhi, Gujarat and Rajasthan have performed very well, but others are yet to catch up, the report said.

Indus Action is a Delhi-based organisation, which works closely with the state and Central governments on the implementation of legislative rights like RTE.

From an all-India enrolment figure of 5.1 lakh in 2013-14, the first year that the Act was seriously implemented by schools, the number declined to 4.8 lakh in 2014-15, then rose to 6 lakh in 2015-16, and finally hit a low of 4.3 lakh in 2016-17. The data has been collated by the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), which is the official data collecting platform of the government of India.

The 2015-16 figure represented 27 per cent enrolment on EWS seats, while for the other three years, the percentage has hovered around the 20 per cent mark.

The report also showed that many schools are still not opening their doors to children from poor families. The number of schools that offered EWS seats was just 16 per cent in 2016-17.

""Lack of school participation is one of the biggest reasons for a low fill rate,"" said the report.

Looking at the low rates of admission in the EWS category, the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development sent a letter to all the states earlier this month, asking them to submit reports on the issue. The ministry, however, said it could only play a monitoring role, and not force states to adopt the rule, as education is a state subject.

There are many reasons for low admissions in the EWS category, ranging from private schools not willing to give admission to students to parents not approaching schools because of lack of awareness.

""A major factor which affects enrolment in this category is the social stigma. Many schools don't open up their doors to children from the weaker section of society, thinking that they will not be able adjust with the rest of the children,"" said Kanika Verma, strategy head of Indus Action.

""Also, many parents are not aware that their children can get admission in private schools, so they end up sending them to government schools only. That is where we are trying to step in and create awareness about the Act,"" she said.

A private school teacher who wished to remain anonymous pointed to another factor. ""Apart from social factors, another factor that plays a part in EWS admissions being low is because there is a very big government school lobby in states, which pushes private schools to not admit children under EWS category, fearing a drop in (government school) numbers,"" the teacher said.

The EWS category is also misused by well-to-do people who are not able to get admission for their children through regular methods. Nursery admission is a major problem for parents, especially in Delhi. Earlier this year, the Delhi Police had arrested a man who produced a fake EWS certificate to get his son admitted in a reputed private school.

The Indus Action report said while the Act is supposed to cover both economically and socially-disadvantaged sections of the society, the breakdown of admissions data between the two categories indicates that the latter group is not getting anywhere near adequate coverage.

""These categories include child in need of care and protection, orphan children, children with special needs, child labourers, transgender children, HIV+ children, among others,"" it said.

""In Delhi, in 2018, only 1 per cent of admissions were under the disadvantaged category. In Gujarat in 2018, less than 1 per cent of admitted students were covered by students in disadvantaged categories.

""While several states have a policy to ensure gender equity in admissions, the policy has not been successful in admitting vulnerable children at a disadvantage,"" the report said."

These days, Sagar Singh frets about the academic future of his daughter who studies at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Delhi's Cantonment area.

""There are hardly any teachers there. She often tells me that kids sit clueless as teachers are forced to teach subjects they themselves don't understand well. I wonder if she will remain underprepared for challenges ahead in life, he said.

Singh sums up the crisis in Delhi government schools which have only 35,034 regular teachers against a sanctioned strength of 64,096. A shortage of 29,062 regular hands (45.34 per cent) has left the teachers exhausted and students vulnerable. A total of 15,04,627 students are enrolled in 1,024 schools run by the AAP government.

There are 22,016 guest teachers that take the existing number to 57,050 but they work on daily-wage contracts that must be renewed every year. Even if guest teachers are factored in, Delhi government schools are short of 7,046 (10.99 per cent) teaching hands.

Saroj Sharma, a primary teacher at a Greater Kailash school said, On several occasions, I have had to teach higher-secondary class subjects. We are overworked and stressed. We are filling in for many others. School heads are aware of the crisis, but nothing has been done.

Neeru Loriya, a teacher coordinator at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in RK Puram Sector 4, also said that several subjects are not being taught properly. Barkha Kumari, a Class VI student at Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini said, My Class has 50 students. We need more teachers to ensure we're taught well. It's not that the government isn't working at all. After the Aam Aadmi Party came to power in Delhi in 2014, the government has built 48 schools.

But where are the teachers? We have sent several reminders to the government. Nothing has happened, said a teacher at a Pusa Road school. Most regular posts are filled through promotions. But they have not happened since 2013, he said.

Sanjay Goel, head of the Delhi government's directorate of education (DoE) told Mail Today, We're aware of the problem. Each year, guest teachers are being enrolled to minimise the shortage. Avdhesh Jha, principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, also said, There is a problem. But the government is hiring guest teachers to tackle it.

But facts tell a different tale. In July, the Delhi government had announced that schools would get 9,000 guest teachers by mid-August. It did not happen. Hiring guest teachers is anyway no solution to this huge crisis, said Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the last Government School Teachers' Association (GSTA) elected in 2014. GSTA elections have not taken place since 2014.

So its demands have not been heard effectively, its office-bearers claim. We have asked for elections. But education department officials have not paid any heed. The future of government school teachers is dark, said Singh. GSTA has a three-year term.

They say the universe conspires to make you what you are. Cynics may dismiss such fanciful thoughts, but once in a while there maybe inexplicable coincidences in someone's life that make you pause. Take well-known Bharatanatyam dancer-abhinaya specialist Bragha Bessell's case -- there was no plan to be a dancer, yet she had the fortune of being trained by four dedicated gurus, two of whom taught and groomed her during childhood, and the other two as gurus for advanced learning. Each of them seemed to have come into her life at the right time to mentor her and to take her art education forward.

Bragha, 64, looks back on her journey as she completes 51 years in dance since her arangetram on December 6, 1967. As any nine-year old, she and her friends were enamoured with the glamour of Bharatanatyam and decided they would learn it. Suddenly, one day she found that she had no playmates as they had all joined dance classes. Not to be left out, she joined Nrithyodaya and learnt all of three thattu adavus from 'Jayakka' before she met Guru Mangudi Dorairaja Iyer in her periappa's home. She was mesmerised by his tejas and his imposing persona, with long, white hair, long, white beard and a big pottu in the middle of his forehead. When he asked her, if she knew how to dance, the young aspirant gave it her all in the basic thattu adavus by sinking into an extreme 'mukkaal mandi' (three-fourth seated stance) for further emphasis.

That show of bravado must have impressed him, because a few days later, there was a knock on their door at 6.30 a.m. It was Guru Dorairaja Iyer saying, 'Today is a good day, I want to start class for the child. Please wake her up, dress her and bring her, I will wait.' For the next one and a half years, Guru Dorairaja Iyer taught Bragha and her little sister Brinda. ""Master was a grandfather-like figure for us. He never lost his temper, so classes were fun. We learnt without realising how big this art is. We celebrated our initiation as dancers with the 'Gaja' pooja, for which Guru Dorairaja Iyer chose every gaja (bell). At the end of the function, he threw a bombshell saying that 'I am 75, and unable to cycle from Kodambakkam to Adyar, almost 12 km, thrice a week. I wanted to bring these girls into the art. Please take it from here.' The ball he set rolling then is still rolling, more than 50 years later,"" says Bragha.

""Guru Chidambaram P.S. Kunchithapadam Pillai, disciple of Kaattumannarkoil Muthukumara Pillai, came into our lives soon after. He was in his forties and much stricter. For 17-and-a-half years, we had no free time, no holidays. From 4 p.m. to 9 p.m., seven days a week, we practised. Imposition was a regular feature. If we came late, imposition. We did not execute an adavu properly, imposition. Or even just like that, we performed an adavu 200 times. Actually, we got used to it, and did not think we were being punished.

""He taught us anga shuddam, how the eyes should follow the arm, the totality of presentation and focus. We understood emotions as he told us stories from the Puranas. Two years after commencing, when our guru told my father we were ready for our debut, my father couldn't believe. My grandfather Ekambaranathar Iyer's friend, the renowned musicologist Professor P. Sambamoorthy, was called in to certify our readiness. He declared that we satisfied the three requisites that he had in mind. What were they? I can only guess. May be talam, anga shuddam and bhavam.""

The guru's only request was that the sisters have their arangetram at the Chidambaram temple. But there was a hurdle; they had to prove their skills to the temple official Nataraja Dikshitar. The test was abhinaya for his padam, 'Kodidu kodidu kopam kollade' (Valachi, Adi). ""He was so impressed that he gave us the sacred space facing the Nataraja sannidhi,"" recalls Bragha.

They began to dance regularly in temples and sabhas, and at home, where their father built a big hall, for visitors from other countries. The young girls learnt to present themselves and the culture to interested foreigners. The guru choreographed many thematic shows such as on Lenin for the Russian Consulate, 'Panchali Sabatham', 'Aarupadai Veedu', 'Thiru Vilayadal' by Nataraja Dikshitar and pieces for Father Schluz of the Leprosy Centre, Madhavaram.

""When our master quit, we felt lost. Someone suggested we teach, but I realised with shock that I knew nothing. I could dance, but not teach. I realised I had been miming and I had no knowledge of the art form. Vadyar had become too old. At 26, I went to Guru Adyar K. Lakshman. I told Lakshman Sir that I wanted to be able to teach and that I needed to learn from the basics. I also told him that since I had an orchestra thatwas dependent on me, I be allowed to do small programmes on my own. He agreed most graciously. Lakshman Sir is one of the most generous gurus I have come across. His words continue to reverberate in my ears, 'Daraalama kathuko, daraalama panniko'.""

Guru Lakshman corrected Bragha's lines and presentation. Subtle corrections such as advising against a flexible elbow and using the wrist to change hastas, enhanced the visual appeal of adavus. He taught her about composers such as Tiger Varadachariar and about vaggeyakaras. He taught her to revere others' vision. ""He would get angry if you messed up someone's choreography. He was very supportive of his students' efforts. I had choreographed a Bharatiyar kavuthuvam on Buddha (Ariya Darisanam) and a Kalakshetra Pasupathi thillana (Simhendra Madhyamam, Adi) for a Natyarangam festival on religion. The next time I performed it, he announced proudly that it was choreographed by me, adding that I had done a good job. It's the greatness of such gurus that they can praise us so wholeheartedly. These values mean more than the dance pieces you learn,"" points out Bragha.

There was more thirst for learning in Bragha. During Sruti Foundation's Bani Festival in the 1980s, she watched Guru V.S. Muthusami Pillai's innovative adavus and was intrigued. Guru Lakshman encouraged her to learn as much as she can. And when Guru Muthusami wanted to teach not just one piece as Bragha had requested, but a full margam, Guru Lakshman had no reservations, 'Please learn whatever he teaches...'.

Bragha heard about Guru Kalanidhi Narayanan from fellow students. With Vadyar's permission, she approached the abhinaya doyenne. Unnerved by her stern façade, she mustered courage to ask for 'just one class.' Fortunately for her, it became three classes per week. This association turned out to be a turning point for Bragha. ""I was awed by the depth of understanding, of bhavam, of characterisations, of situations, of lyrics in Kalanidhi Mami's style. Just as a phrase from the Kamban Ramayana describes Rama's beauty as he entered Mithilapuri, 'Thol kandaar, thole kandaar...', I felt that way about Mami 'Kann kandaar kanne kandaar...' I became mad about the art form. I was constantly thinking about it. No video, no mirror, the practice has to happen within. The mind was the recording machine. That is the video I played and replayed, and prepared myself. To understand mami's depth, I needed 19-20 years of preparation. She stood for beauty, subtlety and dignity.

""You watch, you learn, you grow. The next stage when you show, she would take the cue and develop the abhinaya from your interpretation. It becomes a samvada, a dialogue, at that level. It took me eight years before I could present the javali 'Sarasamu ladetenduku' (Kapi, Adi, Poochi Srinivasa Iyengar). Life teaches you. Anubhavam enlivens art. With age you lose something, you lose your figure, the body is unable to do what it did in your twenties, but you can do so much with your anubhavam, which you could not then. That growth, inner journey, is what is important. You cannot fight nature,"" explains Bragha.

After marriage, She was out of India for about 12 years. She could not dance in Saudi Arabia, and thought her life as a dancer was over. Suddenly one day she got a mail from the then director, Kalakshetra, Leela Samson, inviting her to teach abhinaya for eight weeks. ""My husband and 12-year-old son pushed me to do it. I had been so out of touch, I was thrilled and scared at the same time. I had left my dance notes back in India under lock and key, because they were so precious. I remember the moment I opened that cupboard in Chennai, the past came rushing back. Kalanidhi Mami and my father were both so excited about this offer.""

Bragha has not looked back since. She has become an abhinaya specialist and is much in demand as a teacher and performer. In her words, 'I am at a stage when my students are my gurus. I learn through their questions, performances, mistakes, love and affection. Learning is a never-ending journey.

""My journey in the arts would be incomplete without mentioning two more generous teachers -- Guru Kamalarani, who taught me nattuvangam and looked out for me after my mother died, and scholar V.A.K. Ranga Rao, who helped me re-learn every song with the correct pronunciation and meaning when I started teaching. I have six pillars on whose support my career was built.""

Teacher or dancer, where does her heart lie? She is quick to answer, ""I enjoy performing, but I enjoy teaching much more."" She is keen to pass on all that she learnt from her gurus.

What is Bragha's strength? ""Strength I don't know, what is important for me is the connection with the audience. From the time we learn thattu adavu, we are told to smile and dance. Why? To make contact with the audience. How much we connect, depends on our hardwork, focus, dedication. When you reach a stage, you take them with you. Where? In the inner journey. What is it? It is what you believe, admire, achieve in the appreciation of poetry, characterisations, bhavam, beauty of the art form, take them into that. The important thing is that even though they are with you, you must reach a stage when you are not there with them. Just that beauty exists... It's a lifelong journey. That journey should happen everytime you dance, even in the classroom. If you don't do it in the classroom, it won't happen on stage. I am talking as a practitioner. Not that I have achieved anything. One programme may happen... everytime the journey starts again,"" says Bragha."

The two-hour Bharatanatyam recital will be a compilation of five pieces dedicated to Ganesha, Muruga, Shakti, Siva and Krishna shifting between the elements of Shringara and Bhakti. Mavin sees this as a singular narrative, creating a re-look at the margam and conveying an experience of the rasas through choreography, dance and music.

Mavin Khoo is an internationally recognised dancer, teacher, choreographer and dance scholar. His initial training was at the Temple of Fine Arts, Sutra Dance Theatre and Sri Wilayah Ballet School in Malaysia. He then pursued his training in Bharatanatyam intensively under the legendary dance maestro, Padma Shri Adyar K. Lakshman in Chennai.

He trained further in classical ballet and contemporary dance and has worked with Wayne McGregor, Akram Khan, Shobana Jeyasingh. His own company, mavinkhooDance, was founded in 2003. In 2014, he was appointed artistic director of ?finMalta Dance Ensemble. He is Rehearsal Director to Akram Khan (Company) working on productions such as ITMOI and Giselle with English National Ballet and others.

Mavin is one of the few Bharatanatyam male soloists to have carved a niche for himself as an international touring artist, whilst regularly dancing at all major venues in India, including the Music Academy and Kalakshetra in Chennai.

Renjith was one of the dancers on the opening night of the Darbar Festival in London conceived by renowned dancer Akram Khan and choreographed by Mavin. The performance received favourable reviews by The Guardian and a rave audience response.

Renjith and Vijna have danced at venues over the world and are regular participants in teaching initiatives in the US, Europe and Middle East. They have trained and worked with veteran dancers C V Chandrasekhar and The Dhananjayans. They have also been a part of artistic works of established names in Bharatanatyam like Leela Samson and Malavika Sarukkkai. Renjith and Vijna have presented their work at the Korzo India Dance Festival in Netherlands and collaborated with French contemporary dance choreographer Cecile Loyer for her work, Histoires Vraies, in France.

It has long been Renjith and Vijna's dream to showcase through S?raswatham the complete submission to the art, involvement of spirit, charisma, and theatrical brilliance that Mavin brings to every performance. Students of dance, performers and the art-loving Chennai audience are in for a treat with Mavin on stage balancing his traditional grounding in Bharatanatyam with flamboyant surprises at every turn.

""Aeroplane, boat, fan... People think that is what origami is all about,"" laughs Roopika Sood, an educator and origami artist. There's of course much more to that, as I discover in her snug home at Harrington Road, which doubles up as her working area. The space is alive with her art -- a pleated lamp, green and red Christmas trees, festive décor, vibrant utility boxes, a moving flexagon (an example of kinetic origami).

Holding up a yellow sheet with an intricate pattern in the middle she says, ""This is called tessellation. It is one sheet of paper with repetitive tiling patterns. You can't afford to go wrong with the creases. It's a gruelling process and took me six hours."" Roopika stumbled across origami seven years ago. The introductory session was supposed to be for an hour. ""But I did it at a stretch for six hours. When I got back I wasn't tired,"" she says.

A Sonobe Cube is the first thing that Roopika learnt to make. And that's the first thing she teaches beginners in her class. Sometimes people who attend her classes say they know how this art form works and create a fan (the ones we made back in school) as a quick demo. That's when she fascinates them by adding a little fold and twist to the fan and turning it into a lantern or another charming piece of décor.

The artist has been teaching for the last seven years. ""I was a teacher in Rishi Valley School (Chittoor district). Origami started as a weekend club there. But after the class was oversubscribed, it eventually became part of art and craft activity,"" says Roopika, who started out as an English teacher but after a point, realised she was overlooking English corrections and all her focus was on this craft.

""So I started doing this full time,"" she laughs. She also taught at Sahyadri School in Pune. ""They were starting a maker space. It's a buzzword across schools. It's where they give kids the impetus to experiment with their own ideas. They were looking to start origami design and paper craft. The principal also wanted to experiment with origami and math, to make it more accessible across all age groups. I became a full time origami teacher there.""

A resident of Chennai for the last two years, Roopika teaches this craft to children and adults at her home and at the Temple Tree school campus in Besant Nagar. On other days she travels to different cities to conduct workshops in design and engineering colleges.

""Chennai is very experimental. Parents are looking for avenues other than just intellectual pursuits,"" adds Roopika. She has also discovered that Parrys is the real hub for paper. At any given point of time, she has at least 24 different colour papers at home and the types vary from metal-sheeted and translucent to double-sheeted origami paper.

""Christmas has completely taken over everything we are doing,"" she says pointing to a table filled with 2D and 3D wreaths, Christmas trees, ornaments, 12 point stars, and gift boxes. There are apparently 67 different kinds of methods to make these trees, she says. The gift boxes are a hit this time of the year with people wrapping their gifts in them. ""In traditional Japanese culture, you need to make the gift so appealing that the receiver should not want to open it,"" laughs Roopika and adds, ""They work with a lot of pleatings and embellishments. You can even wrap the present in regular paper and jazz it up by curling, coiling or weaving paper."

Imagine your child gets the opportunity to witness the wonders of the world, interact with children from different parts of the globe and learn about current world issues, all while sitting in a room. He or she is given a first-hand experience of the topography of places and their respective socio-cultural make-up beyond what is taught in textbooks, through virtual classes. Express Parenting got in touch with educator Shiva Kumar, a virtual master teacher, to know more about these virtual classes.

Virtual education

More and more children are enrolling in virtual educative tours, which connect them-even those from the remote corners of the country-to educators who make them travel virtual miles to foster learning. One such initiative, from Microsoft, holds virtual tours through Skype whereby children are taught on various topics ranging from history, computer science, mathematics to issues surrounding human rights, cyber security, and inclusiveness, to name a few.

Kumar, Asia's first Skype Master Teacher, who has been conducting the tours for the past four years, quit his corporate job to follow his passion for teaching. ""Education has been my passion from the beginning. After conducting seminars on emerging technologies and being a member of the academic board at prestigious colleges in the country, I soon realised that to bring a real change in the education system, I should begin at the school level. I realised the limitations of school education, given how students are loaded with a huge syllabus followed by examination,"" said Kumar. That's when the opportunity of becoming a Skype master teacher came up. After some reluctance initially, Kumar finally joined the initiative.

This year, the fourth edition of Skype-a-Thon was held in November, which saw participants from 102 countries travel a total of 23 million virtual miles in the span of two days. Nearly 11,000 students from over 300 schools across India took part, covering 4.26 million virtual miles, the most by any country globally.

An attempt towards empowering students and teachers, these tours enable cultural exchange between students across the world, who ask questions and identify one another through their respective traditions, music, dance, and art and craft, informed Kumar. Some of the collaborations have also addressed issues like the United Nations' sustainability goals, migration and racism. They are taught about the latest researches in the field of science, and taken on virtual tours to zoos and historical sites, apart from exploring a host of other areas.

Kumar currently teaches children, between the age of seven and 15, in Andhra Pradesh. ""We started off with only 10 kids. Today, we have around 60,"" Kumar said.

Virtual classes vs regular school

The sessions are usually held once a week. Children are not evaluated through conventional examination. It is majorly based on observation and then guiding and training them accordingly. As healthy as this experiment sounds, convincing parents in India, especially after they have long integrated themselves and their children into the country's conventional education system, has obviously been an arduous task. After all, for many of us, academic curriculum is the pathway to securing a job in future and not merely about the joy of learning.

""Parents were initially worried that it was a waste of time. But once the practical sessions started, they found it to be encouraging. That said, such form of learning is yet to become mainstream. A lot of parents are still unaware or apprehensive. Most of the kids who have enrolled in the virtual classes are those with relatively progressive parents,"" Kumar expressed. In fact, awareness sessions are also held for parents at regular intervals, he asserted.

How to apply

These virtual Skype sessions are mainly held in collaboration with schools although students can also apply individually. ""Anyone applying individually, needs his or her parents or educator to go to the Microsoft education portal, interact with an educator of their choice and filter out the subjects of interest,"" Kumar explained.

Interestingly, schools in rural areas showed better responsiveness compared to their urban counterparts, according to Kumar. ""Children coming from the rural areas are very hardworking and smart, except for their communication skills. But the confidence that these children build through these sessions helps bring down the barrier,"" said the proud teacher. Parents don't really have to worry about affordability. It is accessible as long as one has an internet connection, he stated.

Kumar has also initiated 'Skype2Village', a social drive to assist kids in Indian rural schools to experience learning beyond borders.

Is unschooling the way forward?

Technology may have improved the experience of learning but will it be sensible enough to completely digress from customary educational methods? Isn't the exposure of a regular school as important? Kumar clarified, ""Virtual teaching actually complements regular teaching. Children work on group projects, learn different perspectives, develop insight and are also trained to approach problems better. They get a worldwide exposure.""

According to Kumar, this form of unschooling is a more effective process. For the uninitiated, unschooling is a recent trend in which students lead the way in directing their learning. ""A lot of learning happens when kids are left to explore on their own. With unschooling, there's less rigidity and a better scope of interaction. Creatively, a child tends to lose a lot by going to school, given the kind of curriculum most of them have. One needs to realise that learning is not just about textbooks and marks. Parents shouldn't just be interested in the end product but be interested in the process too,"" he signed off."

The toddler's parents, who lodged a police complaint Friday and on the basis of which a case was registered Tuesday, allege that their son's face was red and swollen when they got him home Friday evening. The allegations have been refuted by the day care.

According to the complaint, the parents noticed their son's face was red and swollen when they reached home after picking him up at 4.30pm. They then returned to the day care seeking an explanation, police said.

""We returned to the day care around 6.30pm and asked the staff to show us CCTV footage. In the footage, we saw a teacher slapping my son. He was forced to sleep on the floor in the corridor leading to the toilet,"" stated the father in his complaint.

As parents, we have to mind our body language because though we can blame the outer world for our situation, we cannot neglect our responsibility to the child.

By Vaibhav Datar

Ever wondered how people communicated with each other in ancient times, when there was no verbal language? Communication was mostly through gestures and body language. But as verbal language evolved, we got more dependent upon the words we speak and with time, lost the ability to listen to our inner voice.

Having said that, humans have still not lost the ability to decipher unspoken messages completely. We still have a wonderful tool called intuition. In fact, there was a study done to understand whether body language is a learnt skill or inborn. The study compared blind athletes (born blind) with regular athletes. Every time a winner completed his run, his hands went out and head went up, irrespective of whether he was blind or not. This shows that we already have the skills of communicating effectively through our body language. We may have just forgotten the basics to understand and decipher the code.

Children are like sponge, absorbing completely from their environment as much as they can. They are fast learners. They can easily distinguish if their mother is angry or if she is being loving. As parents we have this immense responsibility of teaching children the importance of body language, which is probably the only communication skill that is not taught in schools. We have, unfortunately, no training provided for body language, listening, emotional intelligence, etc.

Advertising

So, a parent has to be the first teacher when it comes to body language, paying attention to how a child sits, stands and communicates with the social environment. Let us look at the key points where parents have the opportunity to teach these skills effectively.

Interaction with your partner

Suppose you are about to get into an argument with your spouse and your child is watching you, how do you react? Do you respond in a manner which speaks highly about you? How is your body responding to your thoughts? Is it in synchronicity with your verbal outburst?

A child is watching you closely and knows how you feel about it. It is best time to teach your child effective body language, by showcasing the right emotions.

Dinner table interactions

What gets discussed at the dinner table? Are we talking about problems or challenges? Or are we speaking about opportunities and solutions? Every interaction that you have with the child or in his presence is registered. How do you react or respond to tricky situations? Because, for a child, his parents are the best teachers. If you take things casually, there is a high probability that your child follow suit. If you focus on negativity, there is a high chance that your kid will do so as well. As parents, it is our responsibility to learn effective body language.

Interactions with others

You meet several people, whether it is in the lift, during social meetings, family get-togethers, birthday parties, etc. Difficult situations arise triggering unwanted reactions, sometimes unconscious retaliations. As parents, we have to mind our body language because though we can blame the outer world for our situation, we cannot neglect our responsibility to the child. For him, you are his world and the way he will face the world depends on how you teach him to do so.

Body language (or nonverbal communication) is a very important tool and the earlier one learns, the better it is for everyone.

While the teachers welcome the innovation wholeheartedly as it does magic in schools, experts opine that video lessons could be used only in addition to classroom learning.

Initially, the department had embedded QR code in the textbooks for classes I, VI, IX and XI - syllabus was revamped in this academic year - and each lesson had at least three QR codes which upon scanning would take you to video lessons of that lesson, explained an official from the department who is involved in the process.

The department also has a YouTube channel with 1.18 lakh subscribers and is planning to launch a 24-hour free satellite education channel, said the official.

""The basic idea is to evoke interest among the students and to make them attend classes regularly. Also, concepts which are considered as difficult by the students, were made into videos to unwrap its complexity,"" the official added.

The video lessons in turn has done magic in the schools as most of the students who were difficult to find in classrooms, were not just found on regular basis, but also noticed paying keen attention to the lessons, said a government schoolteacher on condition of anonymity.

A teacher, who teachers Mathematics, said most of the problems which, in general, students would struggle to understand were solved, within matter of time as the videos explain it with pictorial representations and sound effects.

""Teaching the students to pronounce difficult words has become a fun task now for both students and teachers. But, the only issue that we face is that videos were created only for a few concepts and not for entire lessons,"" T Arulanantham of Tamil Nadu high and higher secondary teachers' association said.

With videos, students can listen to it numerous times until they clearly understand it, while a teacher would not be able to spare much time to explain same doubts during the class hours as they would have to move on to next chapter, he added.

""The video lessons would definitely be useful in understanding difficult concepts, but it should not replace the textbooks completely. How will a student be able to reproduce the concepts in textual manner while giving exams, upon listening only to videos. How will they be able to learn the spelling of words without reading and writing habits,"" district president of Tamil Nadu Post Graduate Teachers Association GR Chentooran questioned.

Meanwhile, PB Prince Gajendra Babu, an educationist, said the video lessons should only be used in addition to reading and it should never be used as a tool to replace teacher as nothing would match the live interaction between teacher and students.

The government should take steps to appoint a teacher per subject per class in all the government schools and ensure that every student was given equitable access to all its initiatives, he added."

The TSPSC was constituted in August 2014 and began functioning from December 18, 2014. The first notification was issued in August 2015 and ever since, notifications for various posts have been a regular feature.

So far, it has issued 132 notifications, including 101 recruitment and 31 departmental, Rashtriya Indian Military College (RIMC) and Career Advancement Scheme (CAS). The government permitted 38,059 posts to the TSPSC and except for 1,877 posts, the commission has notified all the posts besides conducting the recruitment examinations. The notifications for the rest of the posts are expected soon as indents from departments were awaited.

The TSPSC has so far announced results for 20,033 posts and filled 16,050 posts, while it is expected to recruit for another 6,000 posts by the end of December. The certificate verification process for recruitment to 20,380 posts through Teacher Recruitment Test and Group-II services has been completed. However, the final result has been held up due to interim orders of the High Court.

The magnitude of the achievement can be assessed when it is known that all this was done with limited staff. About 91 regular employees are working with the commission, of which only 40 supervisory level officers are involved in issuance of notifications, certificate verification and results among others. With a dearth of supervisory level officers, the entire staff is attending to numerous tasks associated with the recruitment process while handling and monitoring additional responsibilities.

However, notwithstanding the limitations, the TSPSC has revolutionized the recruitment process by conducting Computer Based Recruitment Test (CBRT). So far, 356 recruitment examinations were conducted by the commission, of which close to 117 exams (multiple papers) were done by CBRT mode. Not just recruitment examinations, the Commission conducted 1,537 tests, including departmental, RIMC and half yearly for government officers.

A One-Time Registration (OTR) system initiated by the commission has received overwhelming response from government job seekers. So far, 24,54,715 candidates have registered with the commission through OTR. This apart, a whopping 48.34 lakh applications were received for various posts and 38 lakh candidates took various recruitment examinations conducted by the PSC in the last 40 months.

Impressed by the initiatives, about 10 PSCs from across the country and even the Mauritius Public Service Commission have visited and sought the expertise of the TSPSC. On Monday too, the Tripura PSC was here to study the conduct of CBRT."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

Schools run by the West Bengal government will soon have to put up a notice in classrooms, with detailed information about the curricula and chapters that would be taught by the teachers during a particular semester, an official said.

A notification has been issued by the department of school education, asking all state-run schools to abide by the instruction from the next academic session, he said.

""The new rule is aimed at giving the students a clear idea about what they will learn before the next summative internal assessment test. It will also apprise the teachers of the lessons they need to cover in a given period,"" the school department official said.

Three summative assessment tests are held every year in state-run schools - one during March-April, second around July-August and the third in November-December.

""Ideally, the schools can also put up the same notice somewhere on its campus, where the parents have access. The notice will have to be updated from time to time so that students have no confusion about their academic progress,"" the state official said.

War dramas are a rarity in Telugu Cinema and Ghazi, which dealt with how PNS Ghazi sank in the Bay of Bengal during the 1971 India-Pakistan war, was the showreel that Sankalp needed to dream big and convince everyone that he's going to pull off ambitious ideas. Less than six months later, he had finished writing an early draft of his second feature film Antariksham, and this time, the drama unfolds in space where a bunch of Indian astronauts race against time to save the world.

Anthariksham : Behind the launch

Admittedly, it was a news article that urged Sankalp to write the story of Antariksham, and he vehemently denies rumours that the film is inspired by other space dramas like Gravity or Tik Tik Tik. The first time when Sankalp met Varun Tej to pitch him the idea, the actor recalls being fascinated with the director's narration technique. ""He brought along a few miniature rockets and satellites to explain what he had in his mind. I loved the idea and we decided to work together. Since he had already made Ghazi, I was confident that he could pull it off. More than thinking about how we are going to shoot the film, the look, the sets, and costumes, our initial discussions were more about finding an emotional hook to the story. Telugu audiences aren't use to this genre (space thriller), so we had to add quite a few layers to make it relevant for our audience,"" Varun Tej recalls, adding, ""Thankfully, everyone knows about ISRO, and the rocket launch centre at Sriharikota in Andhra Pradesh. But at the same time, the subject itself is quite universal.""

Apparently, it was Varun Tej starrer Kanche, which convinced Sankalp that he would be apt to play the lead role of an astronaut named Dev. By his own admission, Varun says that he keeps getting interesting scripts all the time because of Kanche. ""It was my second film and I'll always be proud of it. And it also opened a lot of doors for me in the sense that everyone knew that I was looking for good scripts. I'm making a conscious effort to do different stuff. And even if I end up doing a regular commercial film, there'll be some novel element in the story. Obviously, a film like Antariksham is a big challenge for any actor, but more importantly, I liked the way the story is narrated in the film,"" he says.

Six months later, when Sankalp and Varun met again to discuss the script, Rajeev Reddy came on board as a producer, and soon, he took it upon himself to assemble a competent team to make this space thriller a reality. Initially, the team was planning to shoot a portion of the film in Georgia, and rumours were rife that the lead cast would be undergoing training in Kazakhstan; however, eventually, a stunt team from Georgia came down to Hyderabad to train the actors - Varun Tej, Aditi Rao Hydari, Ravi Varma, and Srinivas Avasarala, who were going to play astronauts in the film.

Like Varun, Antariksham is also a first space thriller that Aditi Rao Hydari has been part of in her career, and interestingly, she says she was almost going to say no to the film when she heard the story first! ""The first time we met, Sankalp had made an animated film of what he had in his mind and how he was going to shoot the film. It was unlike anything I had seen, and I really liked Ghazi when I had seen it. However, when I heard the script, I told him that I felt that a working girl, in today's generation, had to be more real. She should have agency when she's part of such a big mission. I was very honest about my opinions which I shared with him, but at the same time, I told him that he doesn't have to change anything just because I said it,"" Aditi recalls.

""When I take up a film, it's important for me to add some value to the story, otherwise, it would be such a waste of time and effort for everyone involved. I don't like to keep people waiting, either. Three months later, while I was shooting for Sammohanam, Sankalp called me again saying that he had made some changes to the script after he too felt that my initial reservations about the character were appropriate. This time, I really wanted to be part of it. It was important for us to have a woman play a key role in the mission, on par with the other guys, because it could have been four guys saving the day. And since, I had this opportunity, it was my responsibility to play my role well.""

Floating in space

One of the biggest challenges for all the actors, playing astronauts, was to be harnessed for days altogether. Since the team didn't have the liberty to shoot in zero gravity, all the portions related to space shuttle and space were shot on the biggest floor in Annapurna Studios, Hyderabad, because an illusion of depth had to be created. The cast underwent extensive training under the aegis of a stunt choreography team from Europe and India. Some of them had already worked on a space thriller in the West and their expertise was of immense help to the cast of Antariksham; however, nothing prepared them to endure the pain for the whole summer of the year.

Varun Tej says, ""A month before the actual shoot, all of us had to undergo extensive training and rehearsals. Since most part of the film is set in space, all our movements had to be choreographed. It's really tough to balance your body and on top of it, you can't show that you are undergoing tremendous physical strain while enacting all those sequences. We had a team from Mumbai who built custom-made rigs to help us perform our stunts. And if you aren't careful enough while doing all this, you'll end up with a back pain, if you are harnessed for too long, or suffer from a pain in the neck. The suit itself is at least 16-18 kilos and once you begin to shoot, it is air-locked. All of us had a tough time shooting during summer, but it was all worth it. Antariksham is a

once in a lifetime experience.""

While Varun didn't suffer any injuries during the shoot, his co-star, Aditi Rao Hydari, who plays an astronaut named Riya, did when she injured her neck in the midst of the shoot. ""That suit was so heavy that it felt like I was wearing that's something five times my weight,"" Aditi laughs, adding, ""It might seem funny in hindsight, but it was really challenging. I get quite claustrophobic, and I used to get tears in my eyes when I saw the suit everyday (laughs). Initially, when I was told about the stunts, I thought I could contort into challenging poses because I've always been physically active, thanks to yoga and Bharatanatyam. However, to be harnessed even for 10 minutes at a stretch is not a joke. I'm 48 kgs and I could manage it somehow, but I'm sure the guys had

a tough time. Moreover, my skin is quite sensitive and the worst part was that I injured my neck because of the helmet. I had to undergo acupuncture and physiotherapy for a few days. I took painkillers to continue shooting after that because I was concerned that the shoot would get cancelled. In less than three days after the incident, I was back on the set. Some of my family members live in Hyderabad, and I made sure that none of them knew about this. Otherwise they wouldn't have allowed me to go back to the shoot. Towards the end of the shoot, I had become so used to the pain and being harnessed that I could easily do backflips and other crazy stuff (laughs). On a serious note, it's all about living in the moment and making everyone believe that it's real.

That world felt so real between action and cut.""

The heart of Antariksham

Beyond all the drama that unfolds in space, Antariksham also has a love story between Dev and Parvathy, a teacher whose father holds a key post in ISRO. Lavanya Tripathi, who plays Parvathy, says, ""It's a beautiful character and the way Sankalp treated the love story between the two character is heartwarming. And the romantic track between the two is the heart of the film. The team had already begun shooting before I came on board. I wasn't sure if I should do the role when they wanted to approach me, but once I heard the story, I was totally hooked. Even if I was going to play a small role, I really wanted to be part of a landmark film."" It's her second film with Varun Tej post Mister, and the actress says that he's already one of her favourite co-stars. ""It was

lovely working with him once again. Varun is very professional. We shared some great moments during the shoot,"" she adds.

A new experience

The film is slated for release on 21 December, and Varun Tej believes that the film will enthrall the audience. ""Antariksham is a serious drama, and it doesn't deviate from the story it tries to tell. We haven't seen such a film in the past, especially in Telugu, and the only thing I can wish for is that people will come to watch it with the right mindset,"" Varun says, adding, ""People expect novelty from films and they will instantly reject cliched ideas. All I can do is to try my best to offer something new with every film."" For Aditi, it's the notion of cinema being timeless that makes her believe in the power of the medium. ""I respect people who have a vision and treat cinema as a timeless medium. And like all great directors, Sankalp too has done something special to

offer a new experience. I'll always cherish being part of this film,"" Aditi confesses.

Varun Tej, Aditi Rao Hydari, and Lavanya Tripathi-starrer Antariksham, directed by Sankalp Reddy, is slated for release on 21 December."

As a part of this project, Railways is considering providing virtual reality glasses to passengers on rent so that they can have a glimpse of the sites without actually being there physically. It is also planning to collaborate with schools and NGOs to take the glasses to classrooms.

""We want to take this forward and offer an opportunity for students across the country, wherever they are, to experience railway heritage. They might not be able to come there physically, but they will experience it as if they were. We want to join hands with educational institutions, NGOs for this purpose.

""The railway minister has asked us to provide such glasses to the onboard staff so that they can be used by passengers,"" Subrata Nath, Executive Director (Heritage) told PTI. The cost of these glasses - Google's version is called Google cardboard - vary, with the cheapest coming for less than Rs 200. All one has to do is use the Google Expedition app or open the Google arts and culture website and search for the railway heritage sites one wishes to visit. In the first phase, virtual expeditions are being created for Kalka Shimla Railway (KSR) and CSMT, Mumbai -- both UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Nath said that the project is exciting especially because it can be used as a teaching tool for students who may be unable to afford trips to the sites themselves. ""Through this innovative project, children and students will be introduced to a new way of learning using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), thus creating classrooms with no boundaries. ""With VR and AR, teachers will no longer be limited by the space of the classroom and this project will allow teacher, say in Kerala or Tamil Nadu to guide students through scenic panorama of Kangra Valley Railway, located thousands of miles away in Himachal Pradesh or Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Mumbai, without travelling even out of their city or town,"" said Nath."

Nirmal Bandhopadhyay goes to College Street every single day. ""There are days when I don't buy a single book,"" the 55-year-old teacher says conspiratorially, unravelling his addiction for the headiness of Kolkata's neighbourhood of books. ""Just flipping through the pages has become an addiction.""

Bandopadhyay's obsession for books and love for the place prevented him for leaving the city. It also stopped him from taking up another job that threatened with such a possibility. ""Leaving this place would have ruined me,"" he adds, visibly shuddering at the possibility.

A street made of books

A kilometre-long stretch of road from Ganesh Chandra Avenue Crossing in Bowbazar to Mahatma Gandhi Road is lined with books on both sides; the eclectic collection on display good can entice any connoisseur of books. A hardcover of Baywatch can be found placed neatly next to a book on Swami Vivekananda's selected lectures. They might even come for the same price. College Street, one of the largest second-hand selling markets in India, has an indubitable surreal charm to it. Known as Boi Para in Bengali, it is a world in itself that functions by its own set of rules. There is nothing pious or profane, nothing too old or new.

The singularity of it might tempt one to compare it with the erstwhile Macondo, Marquez had written about in One Hundred Years Of Solitude, a city where strange things happen and stranger people reside. But it perhaps comes closest to the land of Gup, Salman Rushdie mentions in Haroun and The Sea of Stories, a place where stories are churned out, a place where stories are retained. The booksellers of College Street -- who stop by those walking on the road with the promise of getting them the book they want, assuming always that it is a book that they want, assuming too that there could be no other purpose of visiting the place otherwise -- are the ones maintaining the stories here. They refer to authors with their first name, as if they are talking about some distant cousin they know all about. Well, they do.

Advertising Businessmen of the footpath

No one seems to know the name of stall number 22's owner. Ranjini Mondal, 21, who had come to buy books on a Friday evening, calls him PT Kaku. His fellow booksellers refer to him simply as PT as they come to his stall asking for books they don't have or dump a pile of books on his makeshift wooden table. Sorit Mallick, who has been selling books at College Street for over two decades now, responds to the moniker as if it had always been his name.

""I have books on Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir, several art books on Klimt, Picasso, even some rare books procured from different libraries,"" says the 49-year-old who started started selling second-hand books soon after completing his graduation in Political Science from Sovaranai Memorial College.

The stall might look like it has room only for one, but Mallick says it has over 3,000 books. There are some on the table, there is a pile near his foot, some above him, and some placed next to him, making it seem like the place was built by books and not for them.

Stall number 22 is not an exception. Placed next to each other without a gap, all the stalls approximately share a uniform shape and size.

Mansoor Alam's forefathers have sold books at Boi Para long before there were any stalls. A regular here, Alam says previously books would be tied with a thread to the walls of the then Presidency College and sold. ""My family has been involved in this for 136 years."" His stall is laden with books, ranging from history and archaeology to mythology and photography. ""There are 4,500 books in here,"" he says, adding that his movements have been restricted due to them. ""I don't move my hands much when I stand here. The books might just all fall,"" he says.

Books often spill on to the road, something the booksellers do not mind. ""We are the businessmen of the footpath. Our hands are always dirty,"" Mallick says, showing no semblance of disgust at his perpetually dirty hands. He remembers to carefully clean it though before holding a book.

Space, it seems, is not much of a concern here. In fact, they share a charming indifference towards it by naming their stalls ""Book Mahal"" and ""Boi Palace"". The look on their faces and the way they treat books tell you there is no irony here, and no hyperbole. They really do mean it. These stalls are their palaces and they would rather be here than anywhere else.

'Ki boi chai, bolun?'

The air around College Street is thick with jaded persuasions -- some found between the pages of second-hand books, others uttered by the booksellers. And though their generic, ""Ki boi chai, bolun, shob achey"" (""What book do you want? We have everything"") might seem like a tall claim, it is often not the case. ""College Street is a treasure trove,"" Bandopadhyay says, whose recent visit turned out to be more rewarding that he had anticipated. The middle-aged man could hardly suppress his glee as he held two books -- The Essential Mystery, Major Filmmakers of Indian Art Cinema by John H Wood and In Search Of The Lost Chord by Danny Goldberg in his hands. ""I did not know there was a second edition of this book,"" he says pointing at Hood's book. ""This is golden.""

Both Mallick and Alam take sufficient pride in their collection. Mallick has photocopies of rare academic books. He recollects selling a second-hand book on tea leaves for Rs 500 even though he had asked for Rs 200. ""The customer was so happy to get the book that he refused to buy it for Rs 200,"" he says.

Mallick also takes much gratification in the knowledge that he has never failed to arrange for a book, as and when there has been a need. In his 25 years at College Street, he regards getting his hands on Salman Rushdie's banned Satanic Verses as a highlight. ""Not once, but thrice,"" he says, as if reminding himself of past victories.

Alam, on the other hand, is certain that he has books that one will not find anywhere else. His words ring true as one spots photo books by both Raghu Rai and Henri Cartier-Bresson in his stall. Kept far away from one another -- as if the photographers were having a feud -- the prices, Alam says, vary. Some pay more for Rai then they do for Bresson and years of experience have taught him to understand which reader wants which book and how badly. Experience has also taught them to gauge the worth of a book, to know instinctively which one will sell and which won't, to know who is Camus and who isn't.

'Camus, who?'

""I had no idea who Christie, Coetzee were or even Marquez,"" Md Sajid says, as he arranges the first line of books at his stall. All happen to be written by these authors. It was also at his stall that Bandopadhyay had chanced upon the ""treasure"" of the evening.

Samir Kumar Acharya, an employee at Food Corporation of India, and a College Street regular since 1981, has seen much change. But stopping by Sajid's stall is a habit he has held on to. ""It is still one of the few places that sells good books,"" he says.

Sajid, a Commerce graduate, bashfully admits that he had no idea what he was selling in the beginning. ""I took up the job because my elder brother used to sell book. But I had no idea about the authors. I did not know Camus or Sartre. I had bought their books by chance and they sold like hot cakes."" Sajid also recollects, with endearing nonchalance, how he would pronounce the name of American writer William S Burroughs wrong. ""I would call him Booroughs,"" he says. The name now sits comfortably on his tongue.

Much has changed in the 11 years. The 40-year-old now not only knows how to pronounce authors' names, but also what and how they write. And he credits the readers for it. ""Whatever little I have learnt, I have learnt from the customers, even how to pronounce Burroughs.""

Mallick is of a similar opinion. The first one from his family to be in this business, Mallick remembers being scared when readers would come and ask books by different authors. ""I had gone to my mother and told her I will not be able to continue it,"" he says. But there was a change of heart, soon. ""I thought if others are doing it, some who are even less educated than me, then why not me?"" he asks, rhetorically.

Sheikh Oheed, started helping his uncle sell books at College Street 40 years ago. While selling Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore to a young girl on a Tuesday evening, Oheed shares how difficult it used to be for him to understand which authors the readers were talking about, or what books they wanted. ""Several times I sold a book for much less than I should have.""

Not understanding the reader's choice is no longer a problem now. ""I have learnt on the job.""

Returning the favour

In College Street, nobody really takes a favour without returning one. Readers, who have benefited much from buying books from the stalls, have also, more often than not, contributed to the collection by selling some of their old books. A book by James Baldwin has been traded for a work by Barnes many a times. In an almost similar way, booksellers, who have gained much from the wisdom of the readers, do not hesitate in doling out advices, if and when need be.

Sajid might not be much of a reader, but that does not stop him from suggesting books to some of those who stop by at his stall.

""A couple of years back, very few people used to read James Patterson. If I sensed that they would enjoy his writing, I would recommend. I did the same for Lee Child and there have been so many who have come back and bought books by these authors regularly after that,"" he says.

Mallick admits how often he goes out of his way to give students something other than the easily available Norton critical notes for their texts. ""If everybody writes the same answer, how will they score more?"" he asks, with much concern in his voice.

College Street changes your life

""College Street changed my life,"" Bandopadhyay says, looking at Sajid with much gratitude.

College Street -- trading in stories and almost contorting itself to make place for some more books -- is more ancient than the people who visit here. It perhaps dates back further than most of the books sold here were written.

Advertising

But the place seems not a day older than the booksellers who rehash and modulate their war cry every morning. Their greasy palms that they no longer mind, and the fatigued eyes that light up every time they see a book, make it seem like they co-existed with the place since its inception. They have aged with the place, braved storms together. They make the place that is College Street, as much as the place makes them who they are."

Till a few months ago, they were out on the streets struggling to eke a living. Now, with a roof over their heads and regular meals a certainty, they have come together to launch their first business venture - a flower stall.

Started just a week ago, the little stall has been set up right in front of a tiled building with a board that reads 'Thozhi: Shelter for Transgenders'. A night shelter for transsexuals supported by the Chennai corporation, it is Shivani and Yazhini's home away from home.

""I come from a traditional Muslim family. I have only my mother and since other relatives were not comfortable with me being a transsexual, she was always in two minds whether to accept me or not,"" says 22-year-old Shivani, who was homeless for a year before finding refuge in the night shelter in Chetpet. She hopes to be a beautician in the future.

""We inaugurated it last year; the idea was to have a night shelter for transsexuals as many of them are homeless. Some go to work in the morning but need a place to stay at night,"" says city health officer Senthilnathan. ""Two more shelters are being constructed in other parts of the city,"" he adds.

Initially, the shelter was run by another NGO but after it ran into trouble, the night shelter was dysfunctional for a time. It was handed over to Thozhi, a welfare organisation for transwomen, in July this year. Now, the two big rooms of the building house 25 residents. ""We provide breakfast and lunch as well as snacks, which are funded by local donors,"" says Kaavya, president, Thozhi.

Saara Ali, 25, programme manager for the shelter, says shelter residents are taught yoga, garland making and other vocational skills. Thozhi has also tied up with organisations such as Periferry and Sakhi to find jobs for the residents.

Shivani and Yazhini decided to sell garlands. ""About 10 to 15 people buy garlands every day from us and we make Rs 200 to Rs 400,"" says Yazhini, who dreams of modelling and pursuing her passion for Bharatanatyam. ""I am from Vellore and have done my teacher's training but couldn't find work. I came to Chennai with my sister but when I stay with her, people gossip about the way I dress so I am more comfortable staying in the shelter,"" says Yazhini.

Some of the residents have found job placements. Agnisha, 23, works at the ticket counter in the metro station in Little Mount. ""I want to work hard and become a senior official there,"" she says.

Kamali, 29, works at Kolapasi restaurant. ""I came to Chennai 10 years ago for work but had to quit various jobs once people realised I am a transssexual. Now I earn Rs 12,000 a month,"" says Kamali, who hopes to become an established writer. Thamarai, 25, works at The Bagel Pot in Ambattur. ""I do cooking, serving, and billing and get paid Rs 11,000,"" she says proudly. Jananya, 24, is learning tailoring and hopes to find a job soon.

For many, the shelter is also a refuge where they can stay while undergoing feminisation. ""Here I get free food and shelter and can save money for it,"" says Thamarai. Thilottama, programme coordinator for the shelter, feels there are only few challenges running it. ""Sometime the jamat members try to get the transwomen to go back. But otherwise people are happy here,"" she says. Thozhi is looking for donors who can support the residents. ""We want to give non-vegetarian food twice a week and we also need clothes or dress material for them,"" says Kaavya."
