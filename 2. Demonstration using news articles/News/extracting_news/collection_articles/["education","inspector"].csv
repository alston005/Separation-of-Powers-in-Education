The drives, Operation Smile, a Central government initiative, and Operation Muskaan, an effort by the Rachakonda Police, saw 530 children hailing from different States being rescued from various workplaces where they were employed illegally.

The Rachakonda Police had formed eight teams, each comprising a Sub-Inspector, three male police constables and one woman constable, for drives.

While Operation Smile was in January last year, Operation Muskaan was launched in July. Out of the 530 children rescued, 283 were boys and 104 were girls, all from Telangana. The remaining 138 boys and five girls were from Orissa, Bihar, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Maharashtra.

As per police records, 20 boys were rescued from various industries and companies. During the operation, three missing cases were traced in Nacharam and Medipally as well.

Ten cases were registered under the Juvenile Justice Act, Child Labour Act and Child Labour Prohibition Amendment Act in Balapur, Meerpet, Vanasthalipuram and Pahadishareef against the managements who engaged the children for work.

A total of six cases were registered in Yadadri in connection with selling and buying minors for human trafficking, police said.

During Operation Smile, two Brickline Schools were also started in Rachakonda for providing education to these children. The operations will continue this year as well, officials said."

Joining the National Defence Academy (NDA) was 15-year-old M Sriharsha Surya's dream. Which is why he had come all the way from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh to join a coaching centre in Pune that prepares students for the entrance exam to the premier defence institution. But, he now needs psychiatric treatment, after being thrashed and mentally tortured by the owner of the classes.

Surprisingly, the cops didn't have to look far for the car either: it was a mere two km from their police station. Vijaya Lakshmi Kalyan Chakravarty, 42, Surya's mother, sent an online complaint from Visakhapatnam where they are based, to the Vishrantwadi police on Sunday. Police then lodged the FIR against Anees Kutty, the head of Anees Classes.

Chakravarty said, ""My son had scored 63 per cent in class X and wanted to join the defence forces. We came across Anees Classes in Vishrantwadi, Pune on June 2, which trained students to prepare for entrance exams to NDA, the Army etc.""

She added, ""With a lot of hope and to ensure better education, we admitted my son to Anees Classes though we live in Visakhapatnam. For two years the fees were Rs 1.80 lakh, of which we paid Rs 1 lakh and around R5s 6,000 additional as mess charges.""

Ill-treated students

She said she and her husband soon learnt about the ill-treatment of her son and other students by Kutty. ""Very often Anees Kutty used to harass him mentally and physically. He manhandled him many times. On October 13 this year, he slapped Surya many times and my son called me and said he was unable to bear the torture and did not want to live. We rushed to Pune and brought him back home. He was depressed and is undergoing psychiatric treatment.""

Her husband, music teacher Kalyan said, ""When we questioned Kutty he was rude to us. A few of our son's friends recently gave us the video of the incident on October 13, which helped make our case stronger, and we complained on Sunday.""

The parents said, on October 13, Surya had lunch outside and arrived late to class. They said initially Kutty appeared to ask him where he had gone and why he was late, in jest. But then suddenly he started slapping the boy. Some of Surya's friends filmed this abuse in class.

Kutty was unavailable for comment. Inspector Ashok Saykar of Vishrantwadi police station said, ""We have registered a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and are investigating."""

Speculation is rife in the corridors of power that state Chief Secretary Dinesh Kumar Jain, who is set to retire next month, is under consideration for the position of an election commissioner with the Central Election Commission.

Jain, whose family is based in Delhi, is also understood to be keen on landing the prestigious assignment. Sources, meanwhile, said that the much-awaited major transfer in the state's senior bureaucracy may well be deferred till Jain's fate is revealed. A section in the government is pushing for a three-month extension for Jain as Chief Secretary.

On Hold

What's brewing in the state's excise department? According to sources, a controversial move of revalidating 205 liquor permits, which were found to have been irregularly allotted between 2010 and 2016, has been put on hold. While Excise Minister Chandrasekhar Bawankule had conducted fresh hearings for these cases in October itself, senior department bureaucrats have raised questions over the validity of this review exercise.

Retirement Perk

Three months after his retirement, former medical education department secretary Sanjay Deshmukh, a 1998 batch IAS officer, has landed a post-retirement assignment. Deshmukh has been appointed as Chairperson of the Energy Vigilance Committee of the MSEB Holding Company Ltd. The post had fallen vacant after incumbent P R Baviskar, also a retired IAS officer from the West Bengal cadre, stepped down citing personal reasons.

Promotion Time

Advertising

It is that time of the year when promotions are handed out to police personnel. In the IPS cadre, sources said this time officers belonging to the 1994 batch are eligible for promotion to Additional Director General (ADG) rank. Mumbai's Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Deven Bharti is among those in line for promotion. Others include Ashutosh Dumbare, Dr Sukhwinder Singh, Anup Kumar, Vineet Agarwal and Ramanand Bharma. Meanwhile, IPS officers belonging to the 2001 batch are eligible for promotion to Inspector General of Police rank.

Scoring A Home Run

Politicians are not the only ones who are reluctant to give up perks of office, especially spacious government accommodations, long after they have demitted office. Tales abound in the corridors of power on how several retired bureaucrats, including some who haven't even been accommodated by the government in post-retirement positions, have clung onto official accommodations in violation of norms.

Lectured

This past week, a senior bureaucrat suffered the ignominy of being lectured by his senior in front of representatives of the Maratha Kranti Morcha. Sources said while the CMO had directed the MKM representatives to meet the bureaucrat, he'd left his office leaving them waiting. Objecting to this, they raised the matter with a senior official. The bureaucrat was then recalled and had to sit for the meeting.

Serving A Message

Eknath Khadse may be sulking, but the former minister hasn't lost his acerbic sense of humour. With the BJP leadership having to bear intense ribbing after the poll debacle in the heartland states, Khadse did not miss the opportunity to make himself heard. Eyebrows were raised when Khadse last week stated that permanent loyalty to a party cannot be taken for granted in politics, at a function where senior Congress leader Ulhas Patil publicly offered him support to switch over to his party."

Stalker dies after private parts chopped off in Maharashtra

Thane: A 27-year-old man from Maharashtra's Thane district whose private parts were allegedly chopped off by three persons, including a woman he was reportedly stalking, has died in a Mumbai hospital, police said Sunday. An official said that Tushar Pujare, a home loan adviser, was allegedly stalking a 42-year-old woman in the district's Manpada area and had also visited her home and told her husband about his infatuation. Pujare's brother, in his complaint to the police, said 15 days prior to the incident, the woman had warned Pujare of dire consequences if he did not stop his advances. On December 25, Pujare was called to Nandivli area of Dombivali by the accused on the pretext of arranging a home loan, the official said.

The DI was suspended following the death of two youths in a clash between the police and a mob in front of Daribhit High School in North Dinajpur on September 20.

A department official said on Sunday,

The suspension was withdrawn on Thursday and Mondal was given posting at Bikash Bhavan, the headquarters of the School Education Department here.

Mondal had been suspended after the deaths of Tapas Barman and Rajesh Sarkar, two former students of the high school, during the clash over appointment of two teachers of Urdu and Sanskrit, which was resented by students of the school as they wanted English teachers.

At a press meet after the incident, Education Minister Partha Chatterjee had said the DI was being suspended with immediate effect as he failed to understand the gravity of the situation beforehand and could not communicate to the higher authorities about the urgency in recruitment of English teachers in the school.

Mondal had, however, pleaded innocence saying the appointment of teachers was done by the school education department and not him.

The official said Mondal had replied to the showcause notice issued to him after suspension and after considering all factors, the suspension was withdrawn.

He will join the new office in January.

Addressing his students at a function in Ghazipur, Yadav said, ""If you're a student of this University, never come crying to me. If you ever get into a fight, beat them, if possible murder them, I'll take care of it later.""

The video of Yadav has evoked angry reactions with many blaming his words for the collapsed law and order in the BJP-ruled Uttar Pradesh.

Munshi of engaging in Hindu revivalism through the Somnath Temple project","ThePrint",FALSE,"Sunday marks the 131st birth anniversary of freedom fighter and politician KM Munshi, who was born this day in 1887.

K.M. Munshi, was a political thinker, constitutional lawyer and expert, an institution-builder, and a great patron of Indian culture and civilisation.

Very few remember his contribution towards the rebuilding of the Somnath temple at Prabhas, and the challenges he faced therein.

In 1922, Munshi wrote about the emotional pain that Indians feel about the destruction of the Somnath temple and its ruins:

""Desecrated, burnt and battered, it still stood firm - a monument of our humiliation, and ingratitude. I can scarcely describe the burning shame which I felt on that early morning as I walked on the broken floor of the once-hallowed sabha mandap, littered with broken pillars and scattered stones. Lizards slipped in and out of their holes and the sound of my unfamiliar steps, and Oh! The shame of it! - an inspector's horse, tied there, neighed at my approach with sacrilegious impertinence.""

The Nawab of Junagarh would just not allow the Hindus to rebuild it. But after the accession of Junagarh to India in October 1947, Sardar Patel announced at a public meeting:

""On this auspicious day of the New Year, we have decided that Somnath should be reconstructed. You, people of Saurashtra, should do your best. This is a holy task in which all should participate.""

There was some resistance. Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the education minister at that time and a good friend of Nehru, opposed the idea, and in one of the cabinet meetings, argued that the ruins should be handed over to the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), to be preserved as a historical monument.

However, Maulana Azad never suggested the same measures for Muslim shrines and mosques, which were being repaired by the ASI.

Sardar was very firm and responded with a note:

""The Hindu sentiment in regard to this temple is both strong and widespread. In the present conditions, it is unlikely that this sentiment will be satisfied by mere restoration of the temple or by prolonging its life. The restoration of idol would be a point of honour and sentiments with the Hindu public.""

Nehru presided over the cabinet meeting in which this decision was taken.

But Sardar passed away on 15 December 1950. Mahatma Gandhi, who also approved of the temple plan, was already gone. And Nehru became very hostile, not just to the temple project, but to cabinet colleagues -- mainly Munshi and V.N. Gadgil -- who were associated with it. Both Gadgil's and Munshi's writings bring this out clearly. The preparations began for the prana-pratishtha (installation of deity in the temple, and 'bringing it to life') as per the shaastras and the President of India, Dr Rajendra Prasad, was requested to conduct the ceremony.

In the midst of all this, Nehru called Munshi and said: ""I don't like your trying to restore Somnath. It is Hindu revivalism."" Munshi felt humiliated, more so because Nehru made it seem as if things were being done without his knowledge.

On 24 April 1951, Munshi wrote a long letter to Nehru. Many things related to the rebuilding of the Somnath temple would have remained completely unknown, had it not been for this letter. The letter is available in Munshi's book 'Pilgrimage to Freedom'.

""On 13 December 1947, the Standing Committee of the W.M.P. Ministry accepted Gadgil's proposal that the Government of India should reconstruct the temple in the original form and develop roughly, one square mile of the surrounding area. I understand that this decision was included in the weekly note to the Cabinet.

As I learnt from Gadgil, it was also mentioned to the Cabinet. At the time, the decision of the Government was that the W.M.P. Ministry should reconstruct the old shrines and they were doing so in the case of certain Muslim shrines and mosques.

The Government of India, thereafter, deputed Government architects to visit Prabhas and prepare a report for the reconstruction of the temple.

When the whole scheme was discussed by Sardar with Bapu, he stated that it was alright except that the funds necessary for re-constructing the temple should come from the public. Gadgil also saw Bapu and Bapu gave him the same advice. Thereafter, the idea that the Government of India should finance the reconstruction of the temple was given up...

As you will see, the Government of India not only took the initial decision to reconstruct the temple, but formulated and set the scheme going; alongside creating the agency for its further implementation. This will clearly indicate to you the extent of association, the Government of India has with the scheme...

Yesterday, you referred to 'Hindu revivalism.' It is my faith in our past which has given me the strength to work in the present and look forward to our future. I cannot value freedom if it deprives us of the Bhagavad Gita or uproots our millions from the faith with which they look upon our temples and thereby destroys the texture of our lives. I have been given the privilege of seeing my incessant dream of Somnath reconstruction come true. That makes me feel -- makes me almost sure -- that this shrine once restored to a place of importance in our life, will give our people a purer conception of religion and a more vivid consciousness of our strength, so vital in these days of freedom and its trials.""

Gadgil, the Minister of Urban Development and Rehabilitation then, has also mentioned this attitude of Nehru, after Sardar's death. Gadgil wrote:

""I quoted from the Cabinet reports to prove that Nehru's charge that the thing was being done without informing the Cabinet was not correct. Maulana and Jagjivan Ram said that the matter was discussed. The government of India had spent about hundred thousand rupees on the work.""

But for the courage and conviction of Munshi, the Somnath temple would have not been built. Despite Nehru's strong disapproval and opposition, the president did perform the prana-pratishtha ceremony.

On that day, along with Singh, a civilian identified as Sumit was also shot dead.

A video of Singh lying near the front door of the police jeep with a bullet lodged in his head had gone viral after the violence.

When The Quint visited Prashant Nat's village Chirangati ka Mandeya, also called Natt village, in Bulandshahr, his neighbours said even though the police claim they have sufficient evidence, video and eyewitness accounts to prove that he shot the inspector, they just can't fathom it.

'Prashant Was There Only By Chance'

All the locals said they were shocked to hear that someone like Prashant could hurt anyone. ""He was trying to make an honest living for himself, like all of us. You can see our homes, we are very poor,"" 65-year-old Satveer Singh, who used to be a farmer but doesn't work anymore due to pain in his knees, told The Quint.

Singh added, ""Sun rahain hain hum ki police begunao ko utha rahain hain (We are hearing the police is picking up innocent people).""

Many insisted that Prashant was near the place where the clashes occurred only by chance. ""Prashant's cousin Pinki was to get married in Meerut on 11 December so understandably he had responsibilities to fulfil before the wedding. Bhaat bharne jaana hota hain jahaan kapde, kuch zevar khareedne hote hain. (The Bhat ceremony has to happen for which clothes, some jewellery has to be bought.),"" Satveer said.

A few days after the clashes, lots of people from Chingravati and Prashant's village began to leave. ""Everyone was scared, they also left then but I know he did attend his sister's wedding scheduled for 11 December,"" 20-year-old Kajal, who has known him for decades, told The Quint.

35-year-old Subhash said, ""Prashant kept to his business and never spoke rudely to a soul. He has lived here always, and never has there been an issue or fight involving him, that's why we don't believe all this.""

Prashant Belongs to the Nat Scheduled Caste

The village where 23-year-old Prashant lives is about 3 kilometres from the Chingravati police post where Inspector Subodh Singh was shot. With 30 odd homes, the village has around 150 people, who belong to the Nat Scheduled Caste.

The caste, in their words, consists of very poor people who do manual labour, work in other people's fields or beg for a living.

His friends told The Quint that Prashant completed his secondary education from the Siyana government school and went onto join his elder brother, Moolchand, who was in the taxi business in Kasna, Greater Noida.

Prashant and his wife Sonam are parents to three daughters. Niki, who is five-years-old, and Darpan and Naina who are three and seven-years-old, respectively. They all left their brother and came back to the village a few months ago as their father was not keeping well. ""Prashant would keep visiting but then his father had recurring fever so he came back and was staying here for three-four months straight. His mother also takes medication for the heart,"" Satveer Singh said.

Worked as a Cabbie in Delhi-NCR

Prashant joined his elder brother and began driving a cab for a living in and around Delhi-NCR. He would often get the taxi to his native village. ""He used to work for OLA. We have seen his cab so many times. Prashant used to bring it often, but this time when he came he came without the taxi. He had said there was an accident so he had to leave it back,"" Kajal said.

While on one hand the police claim to have sound evidence against Prashant, who was not named in the original FIR, his neighbours, who've known him for decades, feel he's being blamed wrongfully. Satveer Singh says, ""Bhude se bhude guzar gaye, aisa kabhi haatsa na dekha. (Many people have lived and died, but we've never seen something like this).""

Trump advisor heads to Turkey, Israel after Syria pullout

US national security advisor John Bolton said Friday he would visit Turkey and Israel to coordinate on Syria, after President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all US forces.

Bolton said he would head in January to both Turkey -- which has enthusiastically backed Trump's sudden move -- as well as Israel, a close US ally where the pullout has caused concern.

Bulandshahr violence: BJP MLA claims cop shot himself

BJP MLA Devendra Singh Lodhi on Friday stirred a controversy in Bulandshahr violence case stating that inspector Subodh Kumar shot himself in haste after he became hopeless.

Speaking to ANI, Devnedra Singh said: ""While trying to save himself, the cop became hopeless and fired at himself in haste. He was not targeted by anyone; it was a mob that got aggressive as the police was not filing an FIR.""

Notably, Subodh Singh died on 3 December after violence occurred in Bulandshahr over the finding of cow carcasses in Chingrawath village. The post-mortem revealed that Subodh had six marks of injuries inflicted by stones and also a bullet was stuck inside his skull.

On Thursday police arrested Prashant Natt, a man who allegedly shot inspector Singh. As per police, Natt has confessed to having shot at Singh.

Acting on the complaint lodged by mandal education officer Leela Vathi at the Punganur police station, the cops registered a case against Bhuvaneswari and Naidu, and sent them to remand, said sub-inspector Arun Kumar Reddy.

Honorary president of Balala Hakkula Sangham Achyuta Rao had earlier brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights, New Delhi.

Assistant Superintendent of Police, Kerala Police Cyber Cell, M. Iqbal told The Hindu that a team of officers from Kerala had raided a private residence in Isthanpur this week and arrested Babul Hussain, 26, amid stiff resistance from a gang of local people.

The officers produced the accused in front of a local magistrate on Thursday and procured a transfer warrant to shift him to Kerala for further investigation. The police have booked Hussain on the charges of conspiracy, impersonation, cheating and other relevant provisions of the IT Act.

In June, the Higher Education Department found that anonymous persons had hacked into its official website hosted by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).

It petitioned State Police Chief Loknath Behera for a detailed probe. Mr. Behera constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) under Mr. Iqbal to investigate the case.

Mr. Iqbal and his team sifted through NIC logs for digital clues, if any, left behind by the hackers. They traced the pivot of the digital invasions to an IP address in Isthanpur in West Bengal. The police found that the hackers had sought to slyly supplant the bank account details of at least 400 students eligible for the minority scholarship with those they had generated under false identities.

In some cases, they inserted fictitious names and addresses of non-existent students into the list of eligible candidates on the website.

However, the police said the attempt to steal student scholarship had not out panned out as planned by the conspirators.

The cyber sleuths had also broken through the rather amateurish efforts on the part of the hackers to conceal and spook their IP addresses to hide the provenance of the hacking attempts.

Officers said Hussain, the prime accused, worked in a temporary clerical post in a higher secondary school in West Bengal.

He was knowledgeable about various government benefits for students and could have exploited more such schemes for his financial gain. The detected fraud was just the tip of the iceberg, and more arrests were in the offing. Inspector General of Police, S. Sreejith, supervised the probe."

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday ordered filing of FIRs against the personal secretaries of three senior ministers following a sting operation conducted by a TV news channel purportedly showing the trio seeking bribes against favours, including transfers and contracts.

Taking cognisance of the news report based on the sting, Adityanath has ordered for immediate suspension of the three government staff and institution of a special investigation team (SIT) under additional director general of police (ADG) Lucknow zone, Rajeev Krishna, to probe the matter. Inspector general of police (IGP) of special task force (STF) and senior vigilance bureau department would also be part of the SIT.

The SIT would complete the probe and submit a report within 10 days to the government for further action after recording statements of all the concerned parties. Besides, the state secretariat administration would review similar cases as well so as to pre-empt such incidents in future.

The CM had on earlier occasions issued directives for ensuring transparency and fair play in government procedures. He has stressed zero tolerance by the government towards corruption cases and that prompt action would be taken if there is any complaint from any quarters. However, the sting operation has nonetheless caused massive embarrassment to the government.

The sting showed the personal secretaries of UP backward welfare minister Om Prakash Rajbhar, mnister of state for mining Archana Pandey and minister of state for basic education Sandeep Singh seeking monetary favours for facilitating contracts or transfers.

According to sources, the government would take sternest action in these matter if the accused are found guilty of graft charges so as to deter other government employees from indulging in corrupt practices, especially with the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha poll months away.

In the sting, the personal secretary of Rajbhar is shown allegedly seeking Rs 4 million for a transfer. Besides, there are recordings of the secretariat staff allegedly assuring the sting reporter, posing as a contractor, that a contract for school bag and uniform, would be manipulated by networking with the kin of other state minister. However, Rajbhar has washed his hands of the controversy saying he had nothing to do with the alleged deal and in fact asked his departmental head to probe the matter.

In another news report, the secretary of minister Archana Pandey is shown striking a deal with the sting reporter for getting mining contracts in several districts. Meanwhile, she has also recommended strict action against her staff if found guilty after the probe.

The personal secretary of Sandeep Singh, who is the grandson of Rajasthan governor Kalyan Singh, is purportedly shown tying to fix a deal pertaining to a hypothetical contract of supplying books and seeking his share."

The district inspector of school (DIOS) PK Upadhyay said two schools, Cambridge School in Sector 27 and Bal Bharti School in Sector 21, have agreed to return hiked fees. While Cambridge School management agreed to return hiked amount per semester (₹17,000), Bal Bharti School has decided to return ₹7,000 as hiked amount in one semester.

""We had served notices to the two schools regarding hiked fees in the past and they have now agreed to roll it back. Till now, we have got confirmation from two schools only. We are probing other schools which have also hiked fees,"" Upadhyay said.

The move comes after continued agitation by the All Noida Schools' Parents' Association (ANSPA) against ""arbitrary fee hike"" which is not in accordance with the Uttar Pradesh Self Finance Independent Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act. The ordinance was first brought into motion on April 9, 2018 and the Act was enforced in August this year.

According to K Arunachalam, general secretary of the ANSPA, they had sent a complaint to the DIOS regarding six private schools, namely Apeejay School, Somervillle School, Amity International School, Delhi Public School, Noida, Cambridge School and Bal Bharti School, for increasing fees in an alleged arbitrary manner.

""Although we have received information regarding two schools agreeing to roll back hiked fees, they have not done it yet. If schools really intend to adjust the hiked amount with the future fees, they have to do it in the next quarter. It has been four months since the Act has been enforced, however, no private school has followed it yet,"" Arunachalam said.

On November 3, the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar had held a meet with principals of all private schools in the district and asked them to decided their fee structure as per the newly regulated Act and upload it on their school's website within a week's time.

Reacting to allegations of inaction by the district fee regulatory committee, Upadhyay said, ""We will decide in the next committee meeting on schools which do not follow the fees Act.""

However, Asha Prabhakar, principal of Bal Bharti School, denied claims made by the DIOS.

""We had already returned the hiked fees to parents in July this year. The ordinance came in April and we were told to roll back hiked fees. There was a rise of ₹7,000 in the first quarter and we returned the amount in the second quarter fees. The claims of DIOS that Bal Bharti School has agreed to roll back fees now only is untrue,"" Prabhakar said.

The management of the Cambridge School could not be contacted at the time of this report going to publication."

A locally-made rocket launcher, material for suicide vests and 112 alarm clocks to be used as timers were recovered from the searches, said National Investigation Agency (NIA) Inspector General Alok Mittal.

""They were planning to make not one but a large number of bombs which is evident from 112 alarm clocks recovered by us,"" he said.

The searches were carried out in coordination with Special Cell of Delhi Police and Anti-Terrorism Squad of Uttar Pradesh Police at six places in Jaffrabad, Seelampur in Delhi and 11 places in Uttar Pradesh - six in Amroha, two in Lucknow, two in Hapur and two in Meerut, he said.

The searches and the arrests, including of a 'mufti' from Amroha, come a month before Republic Day celebrations on January 26 when security is heightened across India, particularly in the national capital.

""The members were in an advanced stage of preparation. They were just waiting for the successful assembly of bombs and wanted to hit multiple locations using remote controlled IEDs and pipe bombs and carry out Fidayeen attacks using suicide vests when needed,"" Mittal said.

The probe agency rounded up 16 persons of the group 'Harkat ul Harb e Islam', which loosely translates into war for the cause of Islam, he said.

Of the 16 detained, 10 were arrested - Amroha and five from five from Seelampur and Jaffrabad localities in north-east Delhi - by the NIA, while six are being interrogated. More arrests are likely, Mittal said.

The ""highly-radicalised module"" of youths in the age group of 20-35 years is completely self-funded and no criminal antecedent of its members had surfaced so far, he said.

Those arrested include the alleged mastermind, 29-year-old Mohammed Suhail, a 'mufti', or a Muslim legal expert empowered to give rulings on religious matters, from Amroha in western Uttar Pradesh, an engineering student in a private university in Noida and a third year graduation student in humanities in a university in Delhi as well as two welders, he said.

""It was ascertained that Mufti Mohammed Suhail alias Hazrath and his associates have mobilised funds and have procured weapons, ammunition and explosive material to prepare IED's and bombs and they plan to carry out explosions and fidayeen attacks at places of importance in and around Delhi and also target crowded places,"" he said.

He added that the agency found a video where Suhail is demonstrating the method to complete a bomb circuit.

The agency recovered 25 kg of explosive material -- Potassium Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate, Sulphur etc, he said.

In addition, 12 country-made pistols, 150 rounds of live ammunition, a country-made rocket launcher, 112 alarm clocks, phone circuits, batteries and 51 pipes to be used as bombs were also recovered.

The group had also purchased remote control cars and wireless doorbells to use their circuits in assembling remote controlled improvised explosive devices.

The NIA also recovered steel containers, electric wires, 91 mobile phones, 134 SIM cards, 3 laptops, knife, sword, ISIS-related literature during the searches, he said.

Two brothers -- Raees and Saeed -- had assembled the rocket launcher and some other weapons in their welding shop, he alleged.

Mittal said the suspects had done a reconnaissance of vital Government installations and planned to target political personalities and other important persons.

All arrested youth are moderately educated barring two -- an engineering student and a BA third year student -- and are from middle income families.

The agency is also investigating if Suhail or any other member had taken oath of allegiance with the West Asia-based ISIS and whether anyone had visited the area occupied by the terror outfit.

The officials said there was no trail of foreign funding but about Rs 7.5 lakh in cash have been recovered during the searches.

Among the arrested are two brothers -- Zaid (20) and Zubair (22) -- who were instrumental in arranging batteries, connectors, SIM cards on fake documents and funds for buying bomb-making material, the NIA has alleged.

The two had even stolen gold from their family which was in the range of about Rs 5-7 lakh and sold it in the market to arrange for funds, they said.

According to investigations, the module was founded about 3-4 months ago by Suhail who brought all its members together and indoctrinated them.

The group remained in touch through data-based messaging applications WhatsApp and Telegram to avoid scrutiny of agencies.

Seeing their alarming pace of progress, the central agencies, which had kept the group on surveillance, decided to bust it today.

The NIA had registered a case on December 20 against Suhail and other members.

The agency believes the module has foreign-based handler(s) but their identity and location is still being probed.

The officials refused to comment on media reports citing inputs from other agencies involved in the operation that RSS headquarters and Delhi Police headquarters were also on the hit list.

The group comprises youths in the 20-35 age group with moderate education (barring two), hailing from middle income group families and radicalised by an Amroha-based Mufti, who is also the alleged mastermind and founder of 'Harkat-ul-Harb-e-Islam', which can be loosely translated as 'war for the cause of Islam', the NIA has alleged.

Following are their brief profiles and roles as alleged by the NIA:

* Mufti Mohammed Suhail alias Hazrath (29) the alleged founder of the group is a native of Amroha in West Uttar Pradesh where he works as a Mufti in a madrasa at Hakim Mahtab Uddin Hashmi Road.

Vibrant and despairing, diverse and parochial, hyper-traditional and quick to change, rural India is more than the sum of its contradictions

Let There Be Light

NIGHT VISION: Kids collecting freshly charged LED lanterns at a micro solar power station near Hardoi in UP. (Photo: Bandeep Singh)

Governments are generally bigger on promises than on delivery. On rural electrification, though, PM Narendra Modi has been keen to trumpet his achievements. Modi promised that 18,452 villages that were yet to be 'electrified', out of India's 600,000 villages, would be connected to the grid in 1,000 days. On April 28 this year, he announced that the target had been achieved. Leisang, in Manipur, was the last place in the country to officially receive electricity, ""a historic day in the development journey of India"", as the prime minister tweeted. But there appears to be a difference between being 'electrified' and actually having access to electricity. Recent studies by academics show that power supply and billing in rural areas are significant hurdles, so while households are connected, are they necessarily availing the benefits of having electricity? As the photograph suggests, solar-generated power is crucial to India's commitment to clean energy. Despite solar power being cheaper than its coal-generated equivalent, and despite the rapid increase in India's solar capacity, it is still too small-scale to meet demand.

Battle for Ambedkar

Dr B.R. Ambedkar has always been a celebrated figure, the country's first law minister and architect of the Constitution. But appreciation of his legacy has become a curiously political enterprise of late. Dalits are increasingly an important aspect of the BJP's political calculations, and part of the party's outreach has been for the prime minister to talk up his personal veneration for Ambedkar. Opening a memorial for Ambedkar in April, Narendra Modi claimed that other governments (read Congress-led ones) had paid lip service to Ambedkar while doing nothing to shore up his legacy. BJP leaders, including the likes of party president Amit Shah, have made it a point to be photographed showing obeisance to Ambedkar, but is it helping the party retain the votes it won so comprehensively in 2014? Signs, particularly in the recent assembly polls in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, are not encouraging, with SC votes in the rural heartlands swinging comprehensively towards the Congress.

Fragile Threads

India's traditional textiles have been treasured by people across the globe for centuries. They brought traders and invaders to our shores and may have spun the competitive engines of the industrial revolution which would later all but vanquish them. Today, powerlooms provide some 70 per cent of all Indian fabrics. Yet an astonishing diversity of handloom and handicraft fabrics survives in the Indian countryside, most of it produced by women weavers and embroiderers. While the state has played an important role in preserving these livelihoods-for example, by winning GI or Geographical Indication certification for the phulkari embroidery of Punjab-government policies can also endanger this fragile sector. The roughshod implementation of new GST rules proved a particular threat to the delicate economy of handloom weavers in small towns and villages.

Transports of Delight

The bail gaadi or bullock cart was perhaps the most persistent emblem of rural India-for a couple of thousand years. In the 20th century, the infernal combustion and horsepower of motorised transport made steady inroads into that romantic image. It's a transformation that has moved so fast that younger generations will probably view this image of a 'Tempo' taxi (right) in rural UP with nostalgia. The bhat-suwar, as it is fondly remembered in North India, along with its fellow travellers like the hand-made 'Marutas' of UP or 'vans' of Bengal, is now giving way to new models such as the chhota haathi (the Tata Ace), the Mahindra Jeeto or the Ashok Leyland Dost, as major corporations rediscover rural markets. Tata, for example, saw its rural sales expand by 38 per cent this year-almost twice its growth in urban markets.

Cock-fighting, popular around the country, is just as cruel, and arguably even more vicious than the bull-taming exercise, jallikattu. Both 'pastimes' are banned by the courts. But advocates have successfully argued that on some occasions, particularly on temple premises, cockfights ""held in the traditional manner"" should be permitted. The Hyderabad High Court, however, banned cockfights even during the Sankranti harvest festival in January, an order the SC upheld and led to the arrest of roosters. Yes, roosters.

Cries Over Spilled Milk

LAND OF MILK AND...Dairy farmers at a street protest in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. (Photo: Raju Sanadi)

Farmer anger has been a major story of recent years. And it's still building. Protests have been numerous and vociferous, with thousands marching through New Delhi just last month. Many analysts argue that agrarian distress contributed substantially to the BJP's damaging defeats in the five recent assembly elections. In the past two summers, farmers across the country threw their milk onto the streets in protest at falling prices. Farmers have been demanding greater subsidies to prop up their increasingly meagre earnings. Before milk was being thrown in the streets, it was vegetables and sugarcane. Data from the National Crime Records Bureau show an eight-fold increase in farmer protests between 2014 and 2016. Solutions beyond loan waivers and fiddling with minimum support prices are thin on the ground. Climate change and dwindling groundwater supplies mean the future holds little promise of a 'technological fix'. With a looming general election, politicians are likely to continue to offer financial quick fixes. But a serious conversation about an agrarian crisis that is claiming the lives of thousands of farmers each year is long overdue.

Striking Oil

Little used to happen in Barmer, a dusty, yawning stretch of Rajasthan desert- one of the country's biggest parliamentary constituencies in terms of area- barring the odd cattle fair. In 2004, though, over three billion barrels worth of oil was discovered to be lying under the sands, causing a sudden surge in excitement, and demand for such things as upmarket hotels and luxury cars. In October this year, a subsidiary of Vedanta Resources, the mining company, agreed to a 10-year extension of its contract to produce oil from the Mangala area. Since 2013, Pachpadra, another village in Barmer, has been waiting for a refinery and the promise of wealth and jobs. In July, eight people were arrested for conspiring to steal 50 million barrels of crude oil from the Barmer fields and sell it on for Rs 25 per barrel. Nice work if you can get it?

In the Name of the Cow

RED MEAT: A lull in the fatal lynching of Alimuddin Ansari in Ramgarh, Jharkhand, June 2017. (Photo: Somnath Sen)

Conservative estimates suggest that some 30 people have now been killed by 'gau rakshaks' since 2014, the attackers apparently emboldened by government moves to penalise cow slaughter. Among those lynched was Alimuddin Ansari in Jharkhand last year. Eleven men were sentenced to life imprisonment for the crime by a fast-track court in March. Out on bail, the men were warmly received by their local MP, a Union minister, at his official residence. Earlier this month, in Bulandshahr, an alleged case of cow slaughter led to riots in which a police inspector was shot in the head. As a result of the new wave of 'cow protection', many farmers, unable to feed cows that no longer give milk, have turned their animals loose. Government shelters, such as the one in the picture in Madhya Pradesh, are filled to capacity.

Healthcare on the Hoof

One of the more irritating cliches about India is that it is the land of jugaad, a land where everyone can fashion a bandage out of rags to staunch the bleeding, if only temporarily. And then along comes a picture like this and you have to acknowledge the cliches exist for a reason. For some years now, the government has made certain basic diagnostic tests free of charge. Drugs and diagnostic tests make up as much as 70 per cent of the costs that push millions of people below the poverty line in India each year. To get tests done, people have to go to their nearest clinics, though 'nearest' is a relative term in rural India. Vans were perhaps what they had in mind. But, for these patients in a village in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, a camel will do just as well.

The Maggi Index

NOODLED: A sales drive for Nestle in a village in Muzaffarnagar district, UP. (Photo: Shekhar Ghosh)

India has had over two decades of solid economic growth. Disposable incomes have been rising, if faster in some places and for some people than others. And people all over the country, not just in the metropolitan centres, have access to and want a part of the consumer lifestyle. The scene in this photograph is an example of the spread of 'cityfied' lifestyles. The phenomenal popularity of Maggi in India has always been something of an oddity. The nutrition may be questionable, but Maggi became an urban staple. And perhaps, as a sign of the inexorable march of urbanisation and urban habits, a rural one too.

Business of Beauty

TRADE SECRETS: Beautician Puneeta on a home visit to a client in Malikpur village near Sonepat, Haryana. (Photo: Chandradeep Kumar)

Economic growth may be robust, but jobs remain hard to come by. The government has suggested that self-employment might be the way of the future. This is, of course, a familiar experience for many Indians, particularly those who live in rural India. The great majority of Indians, urban and rural, work in the casual economy. The young beautician pictured here goes door to door, providing a valued service. The salon may be makeshift but the customer isn't complaining. And even the buffaloes seem to approve.

Road to Normalcy?

In April, the now ex-chief minister of Chhattisgarh boasted that the building of roads in the state had progressed to the extent that in ""districts like Bastar and Dantewada you can now go anywhere"". Later that same month, Maoist guerrillas killed 25 CRPF men guarding the highway linking Dantewada to the Sukma district. An extensive government plan is in place to connect some of India's most remote rural areas by road, to enable these villages to participate in countrywide development. Many of these villages are in Chhattisgarh, in the 'Red Corridor' plagued by running battles between the Maoists and security forces.

Reading, Writing and Terrible arithmetic

WRITTEN IN STONE: Young students from the Madia Gond community at a school run by Prakash Amte in Gadchiroli, Maharashtra (Photo: Vikram Sharma)

India's record in education is a deceptive image. Despite the gains made in achieving benchmarks of universal enrolment and better gender parity in primary education in the early 2000s, recent studies have revealed that the country is failing in secondary education. The ASER study in 2017 found that 57 per cent of 14- to 18-year-olds can't solve basic division problems and a government survey in 2014 concluded that only 16 per cent of Class X students could correctly answer more than half the mathematics questions put to them. Rural students from disadvantaged communities risk higher dropout rates and poorer learning. It doesn't help that government expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell from 3.1 per cent in 2012-13 to 2.6 per cent in 2016-17.

The Ghost Villages

While migration from the countryside to the cities is an ancient and universal story, it has reached stark proportions in some parts of the country. In the foothills of Uttarakhand, in particular, the phenomenon has begun to spook even the state government, which in 2017 appointed a 'Migration Commission' to look into the proliferation of bhootiya or 'ghost' villages. The commission found that some 119,000 people had abandoned their homes and agriculture, leaving some 700 villages deserted. The village pictured here, once one of the wealthiest settlements in Kumaon, has been reduced to ruins by the loss of border trade and migration to towns better integrated into the economic mainstream."

A person who was recruited as a talathi in Pune in 2011, through the dummy candidate racket, went on to run a parallel scam in connivance with the main racketeers and four more government employees, the probe by the state Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has revealed. A talathi is a low-ranking revenue officer in the state government.

The information came to light during the interrogation of the accused arrested in the case till now and the subsequent probe by the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the CID. The SIT probe has now zeroed in on the talathi, who was recruited through an examination held at a college in Deccan Gymkhana area and was later posted in Shirur tehsil.

""Among several new facts that came to light in the interrogation of arrested suspects, one of the most important was the fact that there were some offshoots of the original dummy candidate racket. The probe has revealed one person who got recruited later himself started working as middleman. This person is originally from Latur district and was posted in Pune as a talathi in 2011. He further took the help of four more persons, who acted as dummy candidates, to run a parallel racket with the help of the original racketeers,"" said a senior CID officer.

Till now, the SIT has identified and booked as many as 75 government employees who have been recruited through the scam, and arrested 10 persons who allegedly ran the racket. The arrested racketeers include the kingpin Prabodh Rathod, a government employee from Nanded who has been dismissed, and impersonators including two then serving police officers of assistant inspector rank, a CID handwriting expert and a police personnel who was part of the initial probe into the racket. The SIT has filed three chargesheets in the case and is likely to arrest more government officials involved in the racket.

The CID has also arrested 23 government officials who were recruited through the racket. All the 75 government employees, identified in the probe till June this year, were recruited through the racket between 2010 and 2016. These included education officers, tribal development officers, clerks, engineering officers, irrigation inspectors and officers from the state secretariat.

The CID officer added, ""While we have launched a search for this key suspect and his accomplices, some of the suspects who helped him in the past have been arrested by Byculla police in Mumbai earlier this year, thus establishing a link between these different rackets. Some of the candidates who got recruited through the offshoot of this racket have got jobs in Pune, Kolhapur and Aurangabad. In May this year, a separate FIR was registered at Deccan Gymkhana police station over the 2011 exam, through which this suspect was recruited as a talathi.""

A 28-year-old political science graduate, Yogesh Jadhav from Nanded, had first unearthed a series of impersonation cases between 2010 and 2016 by filing several Right to Information (RTI) applications, which led to the statewide probe by the CID SIT. He had started digging into the cases after he got to know that several persons from the region had sold or mortgaged their ancestral land or houses to pay a middleman for their selection to government jobs and positions.

The total number of arrests made by the SIT, in this case, is now 33, including 10 racketeers and 23 officials selected through the scam. However, the total number of cases in which dummy candidates are suspected to have appeared for exams in that period is close to 700, according to a primary estimate of the investigators."

Another Muslim icon is unhappy with the communal situation in India. First, Aamir Khan, then Shah Rukh Khan, then the perennially angry Farooq Abdullah, and now Naseer.

But why is Naseer so angry now? Apparently, because a few cows were slaughtered in Bulandshahr, a mob predictably went into a frenzy and a police inspector died. Mind you, the police inspector was Hindu, probably just doing his duty of controlling the mob. Naseer is angry because more attention is being paid to the killed cows than to the dead police inspector.

Now who killed the cows? If it was a member of the majority community to inflame majoritarian passion, that is indeed reprehensible. But if it was someone from the minority community, that is equally reprehensible. Cow slaughter has been banned in UP, where Bulandshahr is located. Why poke the majority community in the eye unnecessarily, knowing how sacred the cow is to many, many Hindus.

Naseer and prior to him the Khans have insisted that India is their land and that they are not going to Pakistan. Just because some idiot calls you a terrorist, as Farooq Abdullah asserts so vocally that every Muslim is called so in India today, and asks you to go to Pakistan doesn't mean that you get all worked up.

Indians in the West, be they Hindu or Muslim or Sikh or any other community, are constantly called terrorists and asked to leave the land. But they stomach all the insults and go about making our lives. Why can't Indian Muslims emulate them?

The Sachar Committee Report has highlighted the pathetic state of many Indian Muslims. There is obvious systemic discrimination against Muslims in India, just like there is obvious systemic discrimination against Indians in the West. But Indians in the West have not allowed that to hold them back, instead, they have climbed to the top rungs of every profession. That is because they have channelled their anger against discrimination into learning and hard work.

Since the fall of the Mughal Empire, Muslims in India have disdained Western education, including the English language and Western sciences and the arts. Many Hindus embraced these subjects and started doing well, even though they were the downtrodden ones during the prior six hundred years of Islamic rule.

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan wanted to correct this anomaly and set up the Aligarh Muslim University. But the AMU became the bedrock for the people who fought for and won Pakistan. In its formation were laid doubts in many Hindu minds. Would future Sir Syeds emerge and do what he did?

Today the situation in Pakistan is such that no Indian Muslim wants to emigrate there. However, if given a chance, many Pakistani Muslims would like to emigrate to India. India gives each of its residents the right of free expression. It absorbs all complaints, and in general, attempts to alleviate these complaints.

Aamir Khan made billions mocking the Hindu religion and its symbols in PK. Hindus, in the main, watched his film and applauded Aamir for highlighting the hypocrisies in their religion. But what if Aamir had mocked his own religion? What would be his condition now?

Naseer is a liberated man, in the sense that he claims to have not forced his children to adopt any religion. But two out his three children carry obvious Muslim names. MJ Akbar is the only Muslim celebrity that I know of who has married a non-Muslim and given his children obvious Hindu names. There are Muslim celebrities who name their children after some of the worst tormentors of Hindus in history and act blase about it.

Whatever may be said, cow lynchings incidents have been isolated. Naseer didn't appear to have expressed the same anger when the Muzaffarnagar riots broke out, whose brunt the minority community bore. Whoever instigated the riots, and whoever escalated them matters, but not as much as the governments, the Samajwadi Party in UP and the UPA at the centre, who failed to prevent and control the riots. No such mass rioting has happened in the regime of Narendra Modi at the centre, and dare I say, even Yogi Adityanath's in UP.

In many rich neighbourhoods in Delhi, flyers are constantly posted exhorting people to learn the Koran. Quite often these flyers are pulled down, but they quickly go back up again. Just as it is the democratic right enshrined in the Indian Constitution for people to put up these flyers, so too it is the right of others to pull them down, and even proselytize their own religion.

Beti bachao, bahu lao should cut both ways. And what is wrong with Ghar Wapsi? One side can convert but the other cannot? What kind of hypocrisy is this?

Instead of stoking passions, Naseer would be well-advised to utilize his vaunted position to calm fears and praise the martyrdom of the Hindu police inspector who perished in Bulandshahr. Hindu-Muslim tensions in India are already inflamed; they do not need to be fanned further by people who have received the love of both communities in ample measure."

Join this witty fifty-something woman who is pursuing middle-aged sexiness, nailing the work-life balance, taking on the FOMO (fear of missing out), celebrating mid-life discoveries and generally feeling great about ourselves. Hilarious yet poignant, Feisty at Fifty, is both a moving personal story and the ultimate guide to making the fifties the most fabulous decade of your life.

About the author: Recently turned fifty herself, Sudha Menon, a former journalist, is the author of five non-fiction books, a motivational speaker, founder of writing workshop series Get Writing and Writing With Women and a speaker on gender, diversity and inclusion. Now that she has hit the Big Five-Oh, she has started dabbling in other creative pursuits such as learning to dance, sing and trying her hands at other stuff like clay mask painting. On her bucket list? A trip to Spain with her two sisters, daughter, niece and mom where the all-girls group dream of sitting in pretty cafes, drink wine, watch the flamenco dancers and probably learn salsa from a handsome hunk. Also, she means to pursue her secret dream of acting.

Why this subject? Sudha says, ""When you have spent a quarter of a century as a journalist, observing things and recording it in your mind, you become almost instinctive. As I headed towards my 50s, I found myself watching the changes that were happening in my own body and my emotions from a distance. I wrote Feisty At Fifty because I wanted to let other women in this age group and even the men who read the book that your fifties can be a party if you just let loose a bit, let go of the baggage and decide to look at life through happier lenses.""

About the book: Voice of the Runes is a spine-tingling international mystery of love, honour and revenge, which unfolds in 36 hours and races to a thrilling finale. Lund University of Sweden is celebrating its 350th year and investigative journalist Re Parkar has been specially invited to be a part of the grand ceremony in Lund Cathedral. But on the evening before his arrival, Parkar experiences a psychic 'vision' of an evil presence permeating the hallowed walls of the Cathedral and he knows that something terrible is going to happen in the next 36 hours at the university.

Why the subject: The first book in the destination series with Re Parkar, The trail of four took place in Salzburg, Austria. The second book needed to be different in terms of landscape and backdrop and yet evoke an aura of mystical European relevance. Manjiri says, ""I thought that the awe-inspiring and magical runes and runestones steeped in Scandinavian culture were the perfect features for a destination thriller. Also, Sweden and Lund University in its 350th year were the perfect locations for the next Re Parkar novel. But this book is also Magdalena Lindberg's haunting love story that unfolds in 36 hours along with the mystery. It is her first-person narration and as an author I got to tell and live my story through her. The novel is a powerful love story of souls meeting and the consequences of a deep love, making the book a destination thriller which explores destined paths that each one travels.""

About the book: Are some crimes unpardonable? A young lawyer is about to find out. It was just another day in Pune. Just another morning. Until a man decided otherwise and left an entire city horrified, scared, angry and baying for blood. This is the story of Shankar Lande, driver of a state transport bus, who goes on a bone-chilling hour-long rampage on the streets of Pune -- killing 10, maiming 70, and damaging over 100 vehicles, before he is captured. In this case of Shankar Lande vs the city of Pune, the difference between the criminal and the victims is clear as night and day. But a young idealistic lawyer, Varun Gupte, a Punekar, still decides to defend Lande. And in the process seeks help from a psychiatrist, a man who lost his son to the same incident. Caught in the pincer grip of their dilemmas, do the two men crumble? Do they unearth the truth? And does the truth absolve Lande? Inspired by a real incident, The Sane Psychopath is a fictional exploration of a frightening murderous phenomenon of our times.

About the author: Salil Desai is an author, columnist and film-maker based in Pune. He is best known for his much-acclaimed inspector Saralkar mystery series which includes 3 and a Half Murders (2017), The Murder of Sonia Raikkonen (2015) and Killing Ashish Karve (2014). His other popular books are Murder on a Side Street (2011) as well as a collection of short stories, Lost Libido and Other Gulp Fiction (2012). The Sane Psychopath (2018) is his sixth book.

Salil was also one of the four international authors worldwide selected for the HALD International Writers' Residency in Denmark, hosted by the Danish centre for writers and translators in June 2016.

Why the subject: Salil shares, ""You might recollect that on January 25, 2012, a bus driver went berserk and drove around Pune smashing to smithereens everyone and everything that came in his way, for nearly an hour. His murderous frenzy and the mayhem he unleashed defied all reason. What intrigued me completely was that if he was insane, how come he had been employed as a public transport bus driver for several years without anyone noticing any signs? If on the other hand he had done it in rage, what was the nature of this rage that remained unabated for nearly an hour? One can understand a bout of fury lasting 10 - 15 minutes, but once having killed people and smashed vehicles for a few minutes, wouldn't he have come back to his senses and surrendered or something? It was this bewilderment of mine to understand the sane and insane impulses behind this act of mass murder that led me to write 'The Sane Psychopath'.""

'The Sane Psychopath' is a fictional exploration of the volcanic violence ticking away underneath the normal life of our society that can erupt suddenly given the socio-psychological landscape of our times. Individuals are constantly subjected to terrible stress - social, economic, psychological, existential - and not everyone has safety valves, which means these individuals can blow up any time.

Then be prepared to take traffic lessons from the cops for three days at the B Division Traffic police station located in Navrangpura. After the lessons you will have to serve with the traffic cops for an hour at one of the city junctions to regulate traffic flow.

Traffic police began offering the innovative punishment to traffic rule violators caught on Friday at Mithakhali Six Roads. In all, 17 traffic rule violators agreed to take lessons for an hour for three days and serve with traffic police at one of the junctions. Their names will be put on the traffic police portal.

This is the latest innovative idea floated by the traffic cops as they don't want youngsters zooming through city streets on their bikes to fall in to legal trouble.

""The FIRs registered against them could prove a hindrance for them in obtaining a lot of identity documents including passports. We don't want that to happen and hence we will be giving them a choice -- either face an FIR or take lessons and manage traffic for one day,"" said inspector K D Nakum of traffic department.

While traffic norm enforcement is getting stringent with every passing day and a lot of commuters, especially those used to driving without helmets are being fined the new innovation by the traffic department, gives a positive chance to start following traffic norms said Rahul Naik, one of the youngsters stopped by cops for driving a two-wheeler without a helmet.

""On the first day of the drive 17 youths agreed to our proposal of sparing three days to learn traffic rules and regulations, one hour per day and to serve one day with the traffic police at one of the traffic junctions to manage traffic for the fourth day of their choice"" said Nakum.

A traffic official said on the choice of taking lessons, ""If the offender agrees to go through the learning process we take a written undertaking and consent from him. We then call him to B Division traffic police station to coach him in traffic norms and regulations.""

In another, new initiative the traffic police is thinking of writing to principals of schools of colleges whose student is found violating traffic rules. ""This will encourage traffic norm education in school and colleges,"" said a senior traffic department official."

Hitting back at the actor, Pandey told ANI, ""Naseeruddin Shah is a good artiste. In one of his movies, he played the role of a Pakistani agent. Mujhe lagta hain unka yeh bhaav thoda iss samay zyada jag gaya hai (I think this time he is feeling that role a little too passionately)"".

""My children will have no answer,"" Naseeruddin Shah says, ""Because we chose not to give a religious education to our children.""

Shah was speaking in reference to the Bulandshahr violence over cow slaughter that left two dead, including a police officer.

Shah also said that there is a ""poison"" that has spread in the Indian society.

As his comment earned him a lot of criticism and support from various quarters, Shah defended his statement on Friday and said, ""What I said earlier was as a worried Indian. What did I say this time that I am being termed as a traitor? I am expressing concerns about the country I love, the country that is my home. How is that a crime?""

""It will be very difficult to capture this djinn back into the bottle again. There is complete impunity for those who take law into their own hands. In many areas we are witnessing that the death of a cow is more significance than that of a police officer,"" he added.

In the latest case, District Child Protection Officer Kanhu Charan Rout has lodged a complaint against Maa Ambika SC/ST Residential School, Sidhal for running a school by producing forged documents, harassing and humiliating students.

The school was opened in 1992 and the management of the residential school had obtained NOC by submitting a fake land document and other infrastructure. After obtaining NOC from the District Education Officer, Jagatsinghpur, the Board of Secondary Education gave permission to conduct examinations. Meanwhile, the villagers brought allegations of lack of facilities and harassment of students by engaging them in the agriculture field or domestic work.

They alleged that school authorities have pressed the children, including girls, in domestic work and cultivation of paddy crops in the land. The students were also tortured when they refused to do these activities. The parents also alleged that though the strength of the residential school is about 170 from Classes I to X, the stipend of Rs 1,200 was being availed against 300 students.

Acting on the complaint, Collector Yamini Sarangi sought details on the school's infrastructure like toilets, kitchen, drinking water facilities, boundary wall, safety measures and other documents in August.

The school was also asked to comply with the shortcomings within 15 days but the management failed to do so following which the administration obtained permission from the Government and closed the school.

Despite the closure of the school, the management was running it illegally. Inspector-in-charge of Jagatsinghpur police station Rajani Kant Mishra said after receiving allegations, police registered a case against the president, secretary and headmaster of the school as their names are mentioned in the FIR under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act and an investigation is on."

Shah said he doesn't see ""the situation improving any time soon"" and voiced his anxiety about his children's future in a communally charged environment.

The actor condemned the ""impunity provided to those who take the law into their hands"". ""The poison has already spread and it is difficult to put this djinn back into the bottle,"" said Shah.

Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant termed Shah's statement ""a blunder"" and said that he ""deplores"" the actor's comments. ""If his children are caught in a mob they should say they are Hindustani (Indians) Why are they scared?"" Sawant asked. Rajya Sabha MP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ideologue Rakesh Sinha tweeted: ""An artist should not be part of sinister design of anti cil [civil] society propaganda . His statement shows his low thinking."""

On December 3, mob violence broke out in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr over an incident of alleged cow slaughter in the Mahaw village of the district. It led to the death of two men, including that of police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh.

Soon after, the Uttar Pradesh police stated that their main concern was to uncover who had killed the cows and UP chief minister Adityanath also ordered a probe into the alleged cow slaughter, choosing to ignore the killing of Singh.

In an over two-minute video, Shah also expressed anxiety for his children if they were asked about their religion. ""I feel worried about my children. They do not have a religion. I had received religious education as a child. Ratna belongs to a liberal household, so she had received none,"" he said.

The actor added, ""I feel anxious for my children because tomorrow if a mob surrounds them and asks ""are you a Hindu or a Muslim"", they will have no answer.""

It is recognised that the power of the police to fulfil their functions and duties depends on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour and on their ability to secure public respect. Key phrase above is the 'Public approval'. As society progressed, world waked up to the idea of modern policing. The very existence of Police as a separate entity having civilian functions can be traced back to 19th century. Unlike 'Metropolitan bobby' policing model prevailing in London that time, India( British blue-eyed colony) however could only manage to get Royal Irish constabulary policing system in place from its British masters.

The Indian model was designed to infuse fear and awe in the public. Whereas London model revolved around civilian policing which propounded "" Police is public and Public is police"". Former emphasised on Police being a Force, the regime force. Revolt of 1857 against British shook the very foundation of it's empire whose tremors reached up to Britain itself. Result was ""Indian police act 1861'' was introduced in India which stood prophetic even after 157 years. After attaining independence in 1947, minor changes were made to Police law in the forms of Bombay Police Act, Delhi Police Act etc, mostly they were replica of Indian police act 1861.

British Legacies prevalent

Institutionally, it is bizarre to govern the 21st century land and people by the 19th century laws. It brings a yawning gap between the reality and idealism. To cite few examples, laws like Indian Police Act 1861, Indian Penal Code 1860, Indian Evidence Act 1872 etc are still there on the hot seat of police and law governance. The criminal and civil laws have been amended now and then which in turn often breeds ad hocism as the amendment in the law caters to a particular case or situation setting aside the wider application. Being an ally of convenience and not conviction, the humongous growth of piecemeal amendments erode the stability of legal jurisprudence as laws are interrelated ,one change requires changes in other laws too. Section 25 of Indian Police Act 1861 defines responsibility for a police officer to obey lawful orders of his superior. The much bigger audience to whom he is responsible to and accountable to is common public. The narrow narrative of legal responsibility sometime defeats the much wider directive principle of Article 38 of the constitution( welfare state). Thomas Jefferson sounds right when he says"" when a man assumes public trust, he should consider himself a public property"".

Police Ailments

"" It is not that they can't see the solution. It is that they can't see the problem"". G.k Chesterton words seems apt. The best way to assuage popular disaffection is to first admit, yes the problem lies here. Then work on them. From culture of immunity and unaccountability, abuse of power to culture of impunity, problems are too many. Lack of autonomy is an initiator to the vicious cycle of despair, stress, low work efficiency, self estrangement, poor interpersonal relations, alienation and in extreme cases even suicide. Political interference in personnel administration of police make things worse through politicisation of police.

Nithari kaand, Jessica Lal cases highlight the rampant corruption practices in the system which aggravates the already growing trust deficit between citizenry and police. Poor service conditions on the other hand is a nightmare.

Overburdened police, more than 5 lakh vacancies, diversion of major chunk of troops for BandoBast ( VVIPs and politicians security)and Adm duties deprive police of their regular policing duties. Mostly they have no festivals, poor living conditions, family being away which all pile up to result into Bad policing.

Training has seldom dared to make pace with the changing times and modern crimes. Police constabulary has faced the worst burnt of inadequate training. More emphasis on physical aspect( Drill, PT etc) neglects the cognitive development which is of dire need in the streets of India. Cyber crimes, new ways of human trafficking, cruelty by intimate partner, persecution for dowry, insult to modesty etc need much more than a 400 meter sprint by a cop. Human rights education, e- education, making them tech savvy would be few steps to train them according to current demand of situations. Even to maintain status quo these days one has to move continuously with the background. Because ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change"".

Committees and commissions

Plethora of recommendations from Superabundance of committees has helped nobody except the members of the committees. In 1902 Frazer commission gave negative, oppressive, inefficient and terrifying picture of British police. Thanks to financial paucity, no committee was set up in stating years of post independent India. National Police Commission (NPC) was appointed in 1978 under chairmanship of Mr. Dharam Vira. NPC came up with 8 reports, main recommendations being- replace Indian Police Act 1861 by new one, set up 'State Security Commission' to act as one stop centre of policy making and entertaining complaints of common public against erring police officers, tenurial security of DGP ( 4 years), gradual separation in police wings dealing with law & order duties and crime investigation. Fall of government at the centre ensured putting of old recommendations in cold storage.

In 1995 Public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Prakash Singh and N.K Singh asked for the enforcement of NPC's recommendations. In reply to the Supreme Court, new government labelled NPC's recommendations as old and rather pressed for a new committee. Then started the game of committee committee.

The extended family of committees on police reforms- 1998 Julio Ribeiro committee, K. Padmanabhaiah committee, Kamal Nath committee set up to study 627 old recommendations, soli Sorabjee committee. Fate was same for all of them, one bogged down by another. People needed more on ground and less on paper. But no one found the ground. Someone has to tell that how much is too much. Implementing the suggestions can be life saving as, a wrong decision is not forever, it can be reversed. The losses from a delayed decision are forever; they can never be retrieved.

Reforms on the street

Civic action programmes, Police public meets, cricket matches etc all aim to have proximity of public with khakhi. But few men do it everyday, every moment singlehandedly without any budgetary support as a daily routine.The turmoil ridden state of J&K which has been on a boil for past three decades, has often witnessed the utmost cynicism in public eye for state officials. Man with a rank of Inspector General of Police ( IGP), and name Basant Rath(IPS) while discharging his duties as IG traffic J&K, implemented many committees recommendations of improving public trust, make public as active participants rather than passive recipients of services in administration. Such was a trust and hope story scripted by him and exhibited by his team that people used to surround him and click burst of selfies with him. Euphoria for a policeman was unprecedented. His approach having two ends, on one end it was,'Leadership by moving around'(His office being the macadamised floor and footpaths) and on other end it was Broken window approach (violation of traffic rules dealt strenuously and strictly. From women to school children, from an octogenarian to a toddler everyone started connecting to this public official. Result: challans increased tenfold, helmet sales soared, matadors overloading reduced, students allowed to travel on half fare, women to get priority seats in public transport. And seat belts got a hug from the car drivers at last.

Question arises why this 'Servant first approach' ( best ruler is, which is best ruled )could not be emulated by others at mass scale. Why did not he gave excuse of police reforms for his failures. Why he did not accuse the state for his lacunae. Presumably he had faith on himself and constitution of India. Much faith on the powers given by All India services, and extreme faith in people whom he served.

The way forward is every time state and government cannot be blamed for our inactions. Ultimately what matters is what you have done with the things at yours disposal. Esther Dyson puts it rightly,"" I think of who I am as what I have done"". There is no dearth of opportunity to do justice to one's job towards general public. Or other lane to dooms day is to wait for the gospel reforms which would turn the world upside down. Latter is an utopia. Because those gospel reforms again would need implementation. Time is ripe for action. Selfless Acton. Action for people of India. By the people of India.

On Police commemoration day this year, Prime Minister of India emotionally said"" words can never describe the valour and dedication of our Policemen, their bravery. Their sacrifice will always inspire us.""

Instead of declaring us unfit for combat roles without giving us a chance, dare us and we shall prove you wrong. The media quoted you as saying that ""she will say somebody is peeping, so we will have to give a sheet around her"". Please tackle the Peeping Tom and not the woman objecting to him.

I am committing the temerity of questioning you and the wisdom and experience of your outstanding career in the Indian army. As a citizen of India, I have full respect for your leadership and will come to the point without any further ado. I am writing about a statement attributed to you a few days ago, voicing your doubts regarding the assigning of combat roles to women in the Indian army.

I was brought up to believe that I have the freedom to choose the career I want and the life I wish to lead. I am well aware that far too many of my sisters across the country have not been as fortunate in this regard. For centuries, we have been ""boxed"" into certain roles that you have mentioned. We do not question the beauty and strength that comes from being nurturers. We are proud to be home-makers, mothers, sisters and wives. But what if we also want more -- for instance, the freedom to choose?

Many men have helped us in our many struggles to come out of the box. I thought that you are one such supportive soldier, instead of being the one to tell us, nay order us, to be what you consider we ""should be"". Do not let me and millions like me down, General.

You know how tired we are of being told that we are second-grade citizens. You are also well aware that within families, many of us are made to do with left-overs as our food. Spending on our health and education is minimal. We are not safe on the roads and most unsafe in public spaces after dark, or so our families think. There are so many restrictions on our movements and hurdles to our growth.

Advertising

We have just about managed to come out of confined spaces and we are slowly gaining confidence in our own capabilities. It has not been an easy journey, as you know. But we have been steady and determined to make full use of the equality and freedom bestowed on us not by any individual but by the Constitution of India. We are in the process of utilising our rights and opportunities to develop our full potential. I am distressed that instead of rejoicing at our marching ahead in full steam you would want us to retreat.

Mistake it not, General, all we want is the freedom to choose. See how Mary Kom made the country proud when she chose the unconventional sport called boxing. At 35, her home is full of the well-deserved medals and also with the children she loves. There was no ""ruckus"" when she became pregnant nor did child birth or child rearing adversely affect her performance or commitment to her sport. And look at her husband who respected her choices and supported her.

In fact, the last Asian Games show that girls have finally arrived. Vinesh Phogat (wrestling), Rahi Sarnobat (shooting), Swapna Barman (heptathlon) must have been told that they cannot, yet they did. I am sure that they drew their strength from their families who believe that girls can indeed balance homes and careers.

General, many of the flights that you and I routinely take have women either as captains or first flight officers. Was it possible in India, say 60 years back? With both men and women accepting and supporting them, girls in India have dared to touch the forbidden clouds. Not to forget Bachendri Pal who became the first Indian woman to climb the Everest way back in 1984 followed by so many adventurous and ambitious girls. Then why should we shy away from the combat role?

Instead of declaring us unfit for combat roles without giving us a chance, dare us and we shall prove you wrong. The media quoted you as saying that ""...she will say somebody is peeping, so we will have to give a sheet around her"". Please tackle the Peeping Tom and not the woman objecting to him. Some doubts about the combat role for women in the Indian army are expected, but not from you, General. You, in your position of leadership, are expected to innovate and encourage new ideas, lead us on the uncharted roads. How can you become a prisoner of the age-old stereotypes that you are supposed to discourage and discard?

Anyway, the message on the wall is clear for all to see. We, the women of India, have realised that we are not only the mistresses of our destiny but also capable of creating our destinies. There is no stopping us now. ""Combat or no combat"" will be our choice and not anyone else's. Sorry for being blunt, General, but in my school, I learnt that equality and freedom of choice are the soul of our Constitution and I internalised it. With no apology, I claim my right to choose.

Warm regards and season's greetings

Shah sparked a controversy after he apparently referred to the incident in Bulandshahr where violence erupted over the allegations of cow slaughter, leading to the death of a police officer and a civilian in the riots. In a YouTube interview, Shah said ""We have already witnessed that the death of a cow has more significance (in today's India) than that of a police officer.""

On December 3, violent clashes took place between protesters and police after the former allegedly discovered cattle carcasses in a forest and claimed that the cattle had been 'slaughtered'. In the ensuing riots, police inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and a civilian, identified as Sumit, were killed. Naseeruddin Shah's comments spark row: 'Cow more significant than a cop; I fear for my kids in India' - WATCH

Reacting sharply to Shah's criticism of the 'intolerant' atmosphere in the country, BJP leader Ramesh Bidhuri reportedly said that Shah should take his kids to Pakistan ""and settle there"", as per Indiatvnews.com. BJP MP in Rajya Sabha, Rakesh Sinha, also did not take Shah's comments too kindly and said that his statement showed his 'low thinking.""

In his tweet, Sinha said, ""Nasiruddin Shah should first ask Rohingyas to leave Hindustan as according to him India is unsafe for him and his family! An artist should not be part of sinister design of anti cil society propaganda. His statement shows his low thinking (sic)"". He also accused Shah of being a part of a conspiracy to ""defame India.""

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra also told Times Now that he believed that Shah's comments were simply a ""PR stunt."" He said, ""This is not a tolerance and intolerance debate. This is a PR stunt.""

Meanwhile, rebel Aam Aadmi Party leader, Kapil Mishra, also slammed Shah on his statement, asking him why he had not raised a voice during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots or when Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee their homes in Jammu and Kashmir in 1990s due to militancy.

""When the Sikhs were massacred in 1984, Naseeruddin Shah did not get scared. When the Kashmiri Pandits were killed in 1989-1990, Naseeruddin Shah did not get scared. Not a sigh, not a statement. Today Naseeruddin Shah is scared. This fear is political. He must have taken payment for this acting as well,"" Mishra said in his tweet.

On the other hand, the Congress party lent it support to Shah and said that it concurred with the renowned Bollywood actor. In a tweet on its official Twitter account, the Rahul Gandhi-led party posted, ""#NaseeruddinShah we concur, do not fear the hate, fight it. ""

In the video that has created a furore, Shah said, ""I am worried for my kids...if tomorrow, a mob surrounds them and asks which religion they belong to, they will have no answer."" He added that he and his wife Ratna Pathak Shah chose not to give religious education to their children. He added that said that ""poison"" has spread in the Indian society and it will be very difficult to ""capture this djinn back into the bottle""."

On December 3, a mob, including right-wing activists, attacked a police station over alleged cow slaughter in the areas. The incident led to the deaths of Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh and another man.

99 incidents of cow-related violence since 2012; 97 of them during BJP rule

According to the available data, 99 incidents of cow-related violence have taken place across the country since 2012 in which a total of 314 people were targetted by the violent mob. At least 39 people have died in these incidents and 165 suffered major injuries.

2017 was the worst-ever year for cow-related violence with 37 incidents of mob attack. In 2016, the figure was 24 and this year it is 21. While no deaths were reported in cow-related attacks in 2012, 2013 and 2014, 10 people were killed in 2015 alone. In 2016, eight people were hacked to death by cow vigilantes. The highest death toll from cow-related hate crimes since 2012 was in 2017 with 11 people losing their lives.

These attacks were reported from 19 of 29 Indian states, with Uttar Pradesh (16), Haryana (11), Gujarat (8), Karnataka (8), Madhya Pradesh (7) and Rajasthan (7) reporting the highest number of cases. Of the 99 attacks since 2012, 97 occurred after the Modi government came to power. Only two years (2012-2013) of the UPA 2's tenure were included in the data, during which only two cow-related attacks took place. Tags: Bulandshahr violence Cow vigilantes naseeruddin shah"

The Development: The OIG published the names of two health care entities that it deemed ""high risk"" as a result of their refusal to enter into CIAs.

Looking Ahead: False Claims Act (""FCA"") defendants will need to address what will likely be increased pressure to enter into a CIA when negotiating an FCA settlement, but challenges to the OIG''s new approach are likely.

As part of the settlement process in an FCA case, the OIG often will separately seek to impose a CIA on the settling party. Although the OIG has no statutory authority to require a CIA, it is typically presented as an alternative to possible exclusion from participation in federal health care programs or to the OIG's unilateral monitoring. The requirements under a CIA vary depending on the conduct alleged, but they usually include the engagement of an independent review organization to perform periodic audits, required training and education (in addition to any training and education already conducted by the entity), and annual reporting and certification to the OIG. The typical CIA lasts five years, which can be costly and burdensome even for organizations with a mature compliance program.

On September 27, 2018, the OIG released notice of its ""Fraud Risk Indicator"" webpage. The OIG announced it planned to use the Fraud Risk Indicator to publicize an ""assessment of future risk"" posed by health care entities that are subject to the OIG's permissive exclusion authority (most often where the entity settled an FCA case with the Department of Justice (""DOJ"")), but did not agree to a CIA.

The OIG also explained that it would assess entities based on its previously published ""risk spectrum"" in the OIG's nonbinding criteria for implementing its exclusion authority. Categories of risk vary from highest risk, which can result in exclusion, to low risk, which typically covers entities that self-disclose. According to the 2016 guidance, the OIG weighs various factors to determine where an FCA defendant falls on that spectrum, including the nature and circumstances of the alleged conduct, cooperation during government' investigation, corrective measures taken, and history of compliance.

This new initiative is designed to address what the OIG states are ""relatively rare circumstances,"" where an entity has declined to enter into an integrity agreement as part of settlement. That decision may increase the risk of additional scrutiny by agencies following the settlement, such as the initiation of unilateral monitoring or an audit by the OIG or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. With the OIG's new Fraud Risk Indicator, that risk may further increase as the OIG deems certain entities as ""high risk.""

Indeed, on November 6, 2018, the OIG published the names of the first entities that the OIG designated as ""high risk"" based on each entity's decision not to enter into a CIA. The OIG not only identified the entities' names, but also the date of relevant settlement agreements, the city and state where the entity is located, and a link to the DOJ's press release regarding the settlement. The press release further broadcasted the OIG's determination that ""the companies pose a continuing high risk to the Federal health care programs and their beneficiaries.""

The OIG's Fraud Risk Indicator comes more than two years after the 2016 exclusion guidance was released, but on the heels of an April 2018 U.S. Government Accountability Office Report that found that the total number of CIAs in effect had decreased by 44 percent between 2006 and 2016.

In a recent Bloomberg article, the OIG's chief counsel was quoted as saying that the purpose of the Fraud Risk Indicator is to promote transparency but also acknowledged the OIG would welcome any behavioral changes resulting from the public listing. Notably, entities that enter into FCA settlement agreements historically have not admitted any liability or misconduct, but those that refuse CIAs may now be publicly questioned as to their ""future trustworthiness"" based solely on the OIG's Fraud Risk Indicator.

The advent of the ""high-risk"" classification appears to be another way for the government to publicize allegations of fraud, even when they are disputed, and attempt to foreclose the possibility that an entity may challenge its published classification on the OIG's risk spectrum or request removal from the public listing after a certain time period. Further, the OIG acknowledges on the Fraud Risk Indicator webpage that the assessment is based solely on the information received in the context of the FCA case (rather than a comprehensive review of the entity).

Given the potential effects of such public denouncements, challenges to the OIG's new approach are likely."
