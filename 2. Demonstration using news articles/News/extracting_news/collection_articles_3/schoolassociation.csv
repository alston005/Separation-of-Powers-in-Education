The Associa­tion said that the fee was charged after examining and scrutinizing its income and expenses. President JKJCCPS Showkat M Chowdhary said the Fee Fixation Committee, as per the High Court directions, approves the fee for a full calen­dar year and not on monthly basis. He said the schools submit all the documents, income and expenses attested by Chartered Accountant, undertakings and declarations to the Fee Fixation Committee on the basis of which the fee is fixed.

""The private schools hire staff on yearly basis who are provided salary and provident funds for full year. No school hires staff as daily wagers. Accordingly, the schools charge tuition for full calendar year. The schools also make it sure that the teachers and other staff are paid properly. They also upgrade its in­frastructure and other facilities on regular basis in an effort to impart quality education to the students so that they can compete not only at state or national level but at in­ternational level."" About the trans­portation charges, JKJCCPS said the private schools charge for only 10 months even though they provide salary to the drivers and conductors for full year. ""Besides other charges including road tax, insurances are also borne by the schools for 12 months and there is no exemption from any authority or company to schools for the school buses dur­ing winter months. The schools only save fuel during the winter months on the basis of which only 10 months transportation fee is charged from the parents."" JKJCCPS said transport facilities are provided to the students on no profit no loss basis. ""This facility is for the smooth transportation of the students so that they reach the schools and re­turn back home on fixed times. It is neither prudent to say that schools will ply buses on losses.""

JKJCCPS said it is not mandatory for the parents to avail transport facility. ""If parents feel the trans­port is not viable, they can opt out of this facility and drop the students at schools on their own."" It said the Coordination Committee has al­ready given clear-cut instructions to the schools not to charge arbitrarily or make unnecessarily charges.

""We have also urged parents to register their complaints with the Coordination Committee for its prompt redressal."" JKJCCPS urged parents no to resort to media trails instead seek better education for the wards. ""In today's modern world when competition is very high for the students, parents should ex­hort upon the school management to further upgrade infrastructure in terms of latest teaching aids and other facilities which should be in­tegral part of class room.""

JKJCCPS further urged parents' association to sit with coordination committee over the issue and clear doubts, if any, regarding the fee charged from the students.

""We believe that media trials will serve no purpose but only hamper the school functioning and derail our effort to impart quality educa­tion. We will also like to invite me­dia for open discussion and clear any doubts on the matter so that we focus on providing quality education to the students and help parents lay a strong foundation of their children."""

In the wake of Thursday's school van accident in Uttar Pradesh's Kushinagar, in which 13 children died on the spot, the School Bus Owners Association (SBOA) will soon meet the transport commissioner to request disallowing vans from ferrying more students than the vehicle's seating capacity permits. The SBOA will request the transport commissioner to stop giving permits to such small vans in the city and state.

While 13 school children died, eight students suffered injuries in an accident that happened on Thursday morning at Bahpurva railway crossing. This is not the first time that students have been victim to such accidents, claimed SBOA. According to them, the reason behind such accidents is that the number of students taken in such vans is beyond the capacity. The SBOA has decided to meet the transport commissioner soon to stop issuing permits to less than 13-seater vans.

Anil Garg from SBOA said, ""We have decided to meet the transport commissioner soon to request them to stop issuing permits to small vans that ferry school children more than their seating capacity. The permits issued to small vans are for seven seats and they ferry more than that number risking their life.""

Arundhati Chavan, President of United Forum, Parents Teacher Association, said, ""United Forum has appealed in Bombay High Court to ban small vans that ferry many children. These vans are not even monitored by any authorities. Sometimes there are CNG cylinders in the boot of these vans and children keep their school bags on it which is risky as well. To avoid such cases of accidents, the government needs to wake up and ban such small vans that carry children more than their seating capacity.""

However, many parents prefer to send their children to school in such vans due to their lesser charges.

Recently, Education Minister Vinod Tawde had received a complaint letter from parents of pre-primary students going to Maneckji Cooper School in Juhu that the school was forcing them to use the school bus for the transportation of students."

Nikolas Cruz, 19, was wearing a maroon shirt with the logo from the Army Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps program at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when he was arrested shortly after the shooting.

Former JROTC cadets told The Associated Press that Cruz was a member of the small varsity marksmanship team that trained together after class and traveled to other area schools to compete.

It was a close-knit group. One of the other cadets started calling Cruz ""Wolf,"" and the nickname stuck.

""He was a very good shot,"" said Aaron Diener, 20, who gave Cruz a ride to shooting competitions when they were part of the same four-member team in 2016.

""He had an AR-15 he talked about, and pistols he had shot. ... He would tell us, Oh, it was so fun to

shoot this rifle or It was so fun to shoot that. It seemed almost therapeutic to him, the way he spoke about it.""

The JROTC marksmanship program used air rifles special-made for target shooting, typically on indoor ranges at targets the size of a coin.

Records show that the Stoneman Douglas JROTC program received USD 10,827 in non-cash assistance from the NRAs fundraising and charitable arm in 2016, when Cruz was on the squad. The schools

program publicly thanked the NRA Foundation on its Twitter feed.

A spokeswoman for the NRA declined to comment on Friday. The top officers of the foundation are all current or former executives of the NRA.

The more than 1,700 high school JROTC programs nationally also receive financial support from the US military and are typically supervised by retired officers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines.

The military collaborates with school systems on the training curriculum, which includes marching drills, athletic competitions and shooting teams.

Cadets wear military uniforms with ranks and insignias similar to those of the military branch with which they are affiliated.

Peter Mahmood, the retired Army major who supervises the JROTC program at Stoneman Douglas, did not respond to messages left by phone and at his home.

Authorities say Cruz, who was expelled last year for disciplinary reasons, walked into his former school with an AR-15 and opened fire. He is charged with 17 counts of murder.

The shooting teams equipment came in handy for some students during the chaos of the rampage. Junior Colton Haab, a second lieutenant and platoon leader in the schools JROTC, told The Associated Press that he helped usher about 90 students into the room where cadets train with pellet rifles. Haab moved the Kevlar sheets used as a backdrop for target practice away from the wall and told everyone to hide behind them. As it was, the shooter never approached the ROTC rooms.

Haab said he sees nothing negative about the NRAs contribution to the ROTC program. In fact, he said, the equipment the group funded could have helped save the students lives if the gunman had targeted them.

""So I think the NRA actually bonused us in a way,"" he said.

Former cadets say they were surprised the awkward teen they remember from a couple years ago now stands accused of slaughtering students and staff. But, in retrospect, there were signs of trouble.

Kyle Ramos, who was the executive officer of the JROTC battalion, said Cruz spoke about guns and knives incessantly and liked to wear military-style clothing to school. He also bragged about shooting animals for fun.

""He told me he would attack little animals with pellet guns and stuff, and I was a little weirded out by that,"" said Ramos, now 20.

""Like squirrels and lizards and stuff."" Diener said Cruz sometimes missed target practice because he had detention. There was another time he remembers that Aaron Feis, a member of the schools security staff, came to get Cruz out of JROTC class because he was in some sort of trouble. Feis, who was also an assistant football coach at the school, is among those Cruz is charged with killing.

The NRA Foundation gave nearly USD 2.2 million to schools across 30 states in 2016, the most recent year for which its federal tax filings are publicly available.

Of that amount, more than USD 400,000 was in cash grants, while nearly USD 1.8 million came as in-kind donations ranging from equipment for high school air rifle teams to gun safety programs for younger children.

Most of the schools that receive grants are in public districts."
