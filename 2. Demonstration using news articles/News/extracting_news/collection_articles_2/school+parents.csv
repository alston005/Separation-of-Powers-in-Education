Parents of Prajapati, who is a class five student in Gurunanak National High School, Sion, have alleged that their daughter fell ill from the Measles and Rubella (MR) vaccination provided by the government at her school. Prajapati is currently hospitalised and is being observed in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

Government health officials have refuted such allegations and have said the girl was already infected before being vaccinated. According to them, the fact that Prajapati fell ill after being vaccinated is only a coincidence. However, the situation has put school authorities in a fix as parents are no more consenting to vaccines.

The vaccinations were monitored at the Gurunanak National High School on November 29. Prajapati's sister, who is a class seven student in the same school, also received the MR vaccine on that day.

Prajapati's father, Tarkeshwar Prajapati, said, ""After receiving the vaccine my daughter complained of nausea and headache. She was also running a temperature. Since then, she has been under medication and on Sunday, we shifted her to the Sion hospital. Presently, she is in the ICU and has been diagnosed with pneumonia. At the time of the vaccination, she only had a mild cough. As per my knowledge, doctors were given instructions to not administer vaccines to students with a fever or cold and cough. If my daughter had a cough, they should not have vaccinated her.""

Such cases across the state have intimidated parents; they are hesitant to let their children take vaccinations at school.

A parent of another student of the Gurunanak National High School said, ""After reading related reports, I am hesitant to let my children be vaccinated at school. We have been asked to partake in a meeting with the doctors. Let us see what they have to say.""

The principal of the aforementioned school said, ""Most of the parents, though educated have refused to consent to vaccines. We cannot force them. We are organising a meet between parents and government doctors.""

Prashant Redij, secretary of the Mumbai School Principals Association, said, ""Eighty per cent schools have been successful in administering vaccines to their students. Only 15 to 20 per cent parents are doubtful. I think if parents want their children to be vaccinated by family doctors, the government should also direct these doctors to vaccinate children to make the project a success.""

Dr Santosh Revankar, Joint Executive Health Officer, BMC, said, ""Prajapati's case has nothing to do with the vaccine. It is only coincidence that she fell ill after being vaccinated. If the vaccine had to react, it would have reacted immediately; within an hour or so. Her nausea is due to the fear of vaccines.""

Government health officials have refuted allegations made by Gunjan Prajapati's parents. According to them, the girl was already infected before being vaccinated"

Amitesh was one among the many students of Bethany High, Koramangala, who took part in the Digital Detox Champion Award. His essay goes on to end with, ""If we leave these games, we can spend more time outside and spend more quality time studying... This is how digital detox helps us.""

The Digital Detox initiative was launched in July, where children were told that regulating their use of the internet and gadgets could help them gain rewards and recognition. The management, students and parents agreed upon a policy that the parents will share the child's electronic usage time with the school. Dr Akash Ryall, director of Bethany High, says, ""Some parents approached us and told us they were struggling with having a conversation with their kids. They requested the school to intervene. When we researched digital addiction, we found that it can be worse than substance addiction.""

Rewards were distributed across three categories: Those who gave up their gadgets completely, those who used it only on weekends and those who used gadgets for only one hour every day. ""We announced the results during the general assembly so as to motivate more students to take part in it. And for those who didn't take part, we will be holding another round. The winners will be declared at the end of the school year, in March,"" says Dr Akash, adding that across seven institutions, around 100 students were given the award.

Beginning early

Besides schools, parents too are turning to digital detox programmes. In April, city-based mother Shalini Srivastava sent her 12-year-old daughter for a detox programme meant for kids aged 10-15 years old. Since it was during the summer vacation, Shalini didn't want her daughter watching TV or surfing the internet for hours. ""I thought it would be a good way for her to indulge in different activities. Once the programme was done, my daughter took an interest in gardening,"" says Shalini.

Ishwarya Kumar Ahmed and Sudhalini Devadason, co-founders and directors of Upturn Learning Solutions LLP, which launched the initiative, soon started getting requests from parents to launch the programme for younger children too. The duo introduced a junior slot (for five-eight year olds) for the second season of the initiative, which will begin towards the end of November.

During season 1, the programme was conducted over the course of eight days. Season two, however, has been planned over a span of 12 weeks. ""We wanted the programme to be more immersive. The kids will get a chance to recreate the famous Malgudi Days and develop an interest in reading and folklore, learn Kalaripayattu, take part in DIY projects and even be part of a fun offline science experiment,"" explains Ishwarya.

Plugging out

In the first week of October, Time Out From Plugins, an initiative started by city-based mother Tejaswi Uthappa, was launched at Delhi Public School - Bangalore North. The idea was simple: To get students to pledge to time out from plug-ins. Tejaswi recalls instances where parents in her circle would tell her they don't see themselves in their children's lives anymore or have to compete with a screen for their attention. ""The idea was never to abstain. Instead, by logging out of devices for two hours, we could prevent misuse and spend that time fostering real world connections with our loved ones,"" she says. Besides a social media campaign, more schools and hangouts are being approached in order to spread the word."

However, their joy was shortlived as the work, which began after an assurance by MLA Aravind Limbavalli, stopped the very next day with only the worst bits of the road being patched up in a hurried manner. On Tuesday, the situation was back to normal with the road flooded and the school un-approachable, parents rued.

Located just outside the boundaries of the Kadugodi ward, the road is partly under the jurisdiction of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. As a result, the road, around 2 kilometres in length from the main Whitefield-Kadugodi-Hosakote Road, is untarred, muddy and narrow. A few days ago, owing to heavy flooding, the school sent out a warning and operated shuttles till a residential neighbourhood to avoid having their students wade through the waters to reach school.

This incident finally caught the attention of the MLA who then assured that work would be done. ""I thought I would do a fact check and found that only a small stretch has been metalled. But that is not going to help in anyway,"" says Tinu Cherian, a parent.

According to him, it is not possible to walk to school or get there by two-wheeler when the road is flooded. ""Added to this, is the chaos from the whitetopping work on the main road. Just 2 kilometres of whitetopping has turned the area into a nightmare. My daughter uses the school bus and yet misses the first two classes on some days because of traffic and waterlogging,"" he said.

However, according to the BBMP, work will soon be underway to provide an alternative access road to the school. ""This road is partly the responsibility of the Seegehalli Gram Panchayat. However, since the condition was pitiable, we did some very basic road repairs with jelly and other materials. On Monday, there was a survey of the road and also of another route which can connect to the school. Work on this route will begin in 15 days,"" said S Muniswamy, Councillor of the Kadugodi ward.

Meanwhile, the BBMP will create an alternative for the water that accumulates on the road to flow. ""We will at least ensure that there will be no water logging on the road. It is most likely due to some encroachments which will also be cleared,"" he said."

The girl attended school on Wednesday and Thursday but died suddenly at her Baiganwadi residence on Thursday night. ""Her post-mortem will give clarity on what led to her death. There may be other medical comorbidities or history that we are not aware of,"" said Jadhav.

By afternoon, 22 children were sent home after treatment. ""Most are complaining of giddiness, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. They are all stable,"" said Dr Vidya Thakur, superintendent at Rajawadi hospital.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal corporation held a deworming exercise on August 6 and used medical supply provided by the state government. The local BMC health post used albenazone tablet for deworming, which essentially kills tape work, round worm and hook worms in a person's body. Following this, iron and folic acid tablets were given to children.

""Depending on child's health, folic acid may be given for period of 15-30 days. For anaemic kids, it is given for prolonged period. Worms can cause drop in haemoglobin,"" a health official said.

The Excise Department's statement assumes significance as the office of the Deputy Director of Education (DDE) had said it will initiate action against those involved in the incident only after getting the Excise report.

First some background: On March 5, parents of the students approached the school after their wards told them about an Excise 'raid' on their bus while they were returning from a picnic trip in Mahe on March 3. Liquor bottles were seized from the bus. It was alleged the bottles were recovered from the bags of students. Basing their statements on the students' accounts, the parents said the teachers purchased the liquor from Mahe.

On Thursday, Azhiyur Excise check-post inspector P Junaid confirmed two bottles of liquor were seized from a bag from the bus during an inspection. ""However, the bag belonged to the office attender who was on the bus. None of the teachers are involved in the incident,"" Junaid told Express.

He said: ""We seized the bottles as part of routine inspection at the check-post. The bottles were inside the office attender's bag which was hidden among students' bags."" Junaid said the seized bottles were Kerala manufactured and were not bought at Mahe. ""So, we did not register a case. But we warned the office attender not to repeat this,"" he said.

Parents beg to differ

KM Basheer, a parent, said parents got wind of the incident after their kids told them.

""Our kids clearly told us the bus was stopped at Mahe while they were returning from Kannur after the picnic. They said the teachers de-boarded with the office attender's bag to buy liquor. When the bus reached Azhiyur Excise officers - perhaps acting on a tip-off - raided the bus and checked all the bags, including those of the students. The bag of the office attender containing the liquor was seized,"" Basheer said.

""The officers took the teachers, the office attender and the PTA president to the station and questioned them. The officers released the bus after three hours. Our kids reached home around 11 pm instead of 8 pm, as we were earlier informed,"" he said.

While he said the Excise officers may have let the teachers go after a warning and released the bus considering the students, he refused to believe the liquor was not bought from Mahe. ""Who will buy liquor from some other place when it is available at cheaper rates in Mahe? Even if they did buy it from somewhere else, is it right on the teachers' part to carry liquor while they are on picnic with students who are studying in Classes III to VII?"" he asked.

Parents of several students have demanded action against the teachers. ""We will not allow the teachers to continue teaching in the school from the next academic year. They should be transferred,"" said Basheer.

Meeting called

The panchayat president has called a meeting to discuss the controversial issue. Basheer said parents, teachers and officers from the Education and Police Departments will attend the meeting. ""We will demand strong action against erring faculty members. The PTA president should resign,"" Basheer said.

Childline submits report

Childline has submitted a report on the issue to the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). ""The report was prepared on the basis of the students' statements,"" said Childline coordinator C P Semijas.

CWC awaiting police report
