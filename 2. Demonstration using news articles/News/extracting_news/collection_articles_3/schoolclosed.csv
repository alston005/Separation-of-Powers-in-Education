Authorities declared a holiday for all schools and colleges in Tamil Nadu's Chennai district on Thursday following a prediction of incessant rainfall in the region, a week after Cyclone Gaja hit the state.

""Intermittent rain or thundershower is likely to occur in and around Chennai likely heavy at times,"" the Regional Meteorological Centre in Chennai said.

The department is considering closing down the school after two children were found to be allegedly raped/molested there.

The school has been shut for the last 10 days. On Wednesday, as many as 162 parents met the DEO and requested her not to close down the school. They fear changing school in the middle of the year would be difficult and pose financial and logistical issues. Zareena Shah, mother of a class 10 student, says though the sexual harassment charges cannot be dismissed, future of other students cannot be overlooked.

""An investigation is going on and the DEO should allow classes to continue under her supervision,"" she says. ""If there were lapses on the part of school management, take action against them. But, don't shut down the school,"" says Zareena. Ameen Mirza, another parent, says parents are worried about both the safety of their children and their academics.

Meanwhile, the school management has sent its response to the second notice from the DEO office. The management is learnt to have stood by its stand that there are no lapses from its side but has not substantiated it with any documentary proof. ""In view of the serious nature of the incidents, closure of the school appears to be the most likely action. But we are looking at all possibilities. We don't want any child to be affected,"" said a senior official and ruled out the possibility of changing the management and running the school.

'35L students to be affected if budget schools are shut down'

Unhappy at the government's refusal to issue extension of temporary recognition (ETR) without insisting upon different No Objection Certificates -- fire, traffic and GHMC, the Telangana Recognised Schools Management Association (TRSMA) has called for a bandh of all budget schools on Friday. The term budget schools refers to schools which charge fee less than Rs 30,000. According to the TRSMA, the National Building Code came into force in 1998, fire NOC became mandatory in 2005 and traffic NOC from 2009 onwards, therefore nearly 80 per cent of schools established before these norms were enforced are now found to be violators. S Srinivas, president of TRSMA, alleged that the government is deliberately tightening the noose around the budget schools in order to shut them.

""As part of its KG to PG education programme, it plans to open up 500 more schools next year so they want to shut our schools. We are ready to even hand over the management of our schools to government so that it can run them government schools and regularise all our teachers too,"" he said. There are 35 lakh students in 1,200 budgets schools across the State and closure of these schools will affect their future."

Donning their uniform and clutching schoolbags, 43 students, including a fair sprinkling of girls, arrived near the CM's residence in JP Nagar around 5am.

After meeting the students around 10.45am and giving them a patient hearing, Kumaraswamy ordered officials to ensure that the school is not shut down.

The students said they were told by the authorities on June 16 that their 24-year-old school would be closed and they would be shifted to a school in Bharamasagara, which is 15km away. According to the children, classes for this academic year have already begun. While admissions for class 8 were under way, lessons for classes 9 and 10 were being imparted.

Officials cited the poor strength of students -- the Alaghatta school has about 50 of them -- as a reason for closing the institution and relocating the students to Bharamasagara.

Accompanied by villagers, the distraught students left their village around 11.30pm on Sunday night. Around 8.45am, the CM's officials collected details from them.

When the CM was about to leave in his car around 10.45am, the students called out to him. Drawn by their 'CM Saar"" cries, Kumaraswamy stopped, met the kids and assured them that their demand would be met.

He also asked villagers why they had brought the children to the city. The villagers replied that they didn't have an option as no one paid heed to their grievances.

The CM has sought a report from officials on the number of students in the school.

Gram Panchayat member of Alaghatta, E Nagaraj, said education department officials were helping the private school lobby by shutting down the decades-old school.

Ironically, Friday's shooting at Forest High School in Ocala happened on a day planned for a national classroom walkout to protest gun violence. A 17-year-old boy was taken to a hospital for treatment of a non-life threatening wound to his ankle.

The suspect, Sky Bouche said ""sorry,"" followed by ""it doesn't matter anyway"" to reporters as he was led from the school in handcuffs by several deputies. Authorities said Bouche was a former student at the school. ""I didn't shoot anyone,"" he said to reporters. He ignored most of the other questions until asked what he'd say to the victim. That's when he said, ""Sorry.""

A shootout took place at the Forest High School on Friday. AP

The shooting comes just over two months after a gunman killed 17 people and wounded 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Nikolas Cruz, 19, faces the death penalty if convicted in that Valentine's Day shooting.

It also coincided with a nationwide student walkout to protest gun violence on the anniversary of the 1999 massacre at Colorado's Columbine High School. The Ocala school had planned its version of a walkout, students said.

Chris Oliver told the Ocala Star-Banner that his 16-year-old son, a Forest student, told him the shooting happened near his classroom. The boy told Oliver the shooter stood in a hallway and fired at a closed classroom door. The shooter then dropped the weapon, ran and tried to hide, the boy told his father.

Craig Ham, deputy superintendent of Ocala schools operations, said the gunman carried the shotgun in a guitar case into the school by blending in with students. Ham told reporters the shooter fired at the bottom of a locked classroom door, and pellets struck the victim in the ankle.

Jake Mailhiot's psychology class had just begun on Friday morning when school officials announced a ""code red"" alert over the intercom.

""You could hear in their voice that this wasn't a drill,"" the 16-year-old junior said. Prepared for such alerts, students and teachers leapt into action to barricade the classroom's one door and block the door's window. ""Our teachers started pushing file cabinets and desks toward the door, and a few friends and I joined in,"" Mailhiot said. ""We also started tying together some jackets to hang out the window, in case we needed another way out.""

In a photograph Mailhiot shared on social media, the classroom door is invisible behind a tall pile of furniture. Mailhiot said about 15 people in the classroom waited over 30 minutes to be evacuated by Ocala police. They were instructed to leave with their hands up, he said.

Marion county sheriff Billy Woods praised the quick response by the school resource officer, as well as school personnel and first responders.

In the Parkland shooting, school resource officer Scot Peterson retired amid accusations that he didn't do enough to confront the Stoneman Douglas gunman.

The Forest resource officer, Marion county sheriff's deputy James Long did not hesitate. ""He went right in,"" Woods said at a news conference. Woods said Long heard a ""large, loud banging sound"" and immediately responded.

The sheriff said the Bouche wasn't injured, wasn't fired at and was arrested without resistance. ""Marion county does everything to protect their children,"" Woods said.

Afterward, all students were taken by bus with a police escort to First Baptist Church of Ocala, where parents gathered to pick them up, officials said.

Rachael Carter was at the church waiting to be reunited with her daughter, a 10th-grader who turned 16 this week. Carter's pastor called her when he saw a post on social media. ""I'm shaking like a leaf in a hurricane,"" Carter said. Forest High has an enrollment of more than 2,000 students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

For students like Maya, a Std 4 dropout from a Kannada medium school, the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) would seem like a Godsend.

Far removed from the rigid structure of conventional schools that require compulsory attendance, the NIOS allows for students to have access to education, with many conveniences, distance being one of them.

When Maya, who could read, write and speak fluently in Kannada, heard about the NIOS, she thought it was a dream come true. She could continue her education despite the gap and her long-cherished dream of getting a school certificate would be fulfilled. However when she decided to enroll herself in NIOS for the Std 10 exam, she realised that Kannada was not included as the medium of instruction for Std 10, although up until Std 10, it is. At the Std 10 level, students like Maya would have to choose either Hindi or English as a medium of instruction, for study material and for questions papers.

However, she was told that she could answer the question paper in Kannada since she was not fluent in Hindi or English.

The most crucial exam of a student's life had become a battle of languages.

Fortunately, students like Maya, have in Iffat Faridi, an educationist and a resident of Bengaluru, a saviour who understands the challenges of studying in one language and being tested in quite another. And Faridi is leading the fight for giving girls like Maya the advantage of doing their Std 10 exams in a language they have fluency in.

Besides taking education to the people from underprivileged sections of society, Faridi is championing the cause to have Kannada as one of the languages of instruction in the NIOS system for Std 10.

Speaking to BM, Faridi said, ""A blessing in disguise, the National Institute of Open School plays a pivotal role in the distance education system of India. It is a ray of hope for children who are not fortunate enough to join regular schools or who could not continue their schooling. Despite its obvious significant contribution to the Indian education system, NIOS has a serious issue in its system which needs to be highlighted and must be resolved,"" she added.

Not just Maya...

She recounts the story of Renuka, a child of a migrant labourers from Gulbarga district, who is facing similar issues. Renuka started her schooling almost at the age of 10, after going through bridge courses based on modules developed by the Azim Premji Foundation in Kannada, Environmental studies and Math. She was admitted to a Kannada medium school, and initially enrolled in Std 1 as per rules. Later, based on performance tests conducted by the school, she was promoted to Std IV. At the moment, the 14-year-old wants to apply for Std 10 exams through NIOS and she faces the same issues as Maya. She has good command over Kannada but will have to master Hindi or English to learn the study material.

Faridi's fight

Says Faridi, ""Lack of study material in Kannada is a huge setback and injustice to the aspirations of those children who have done schooling purely in Kannada medium. Kids referred to NIOS belong to a class where parents are daily wagers. They earn very little and that too after working very hard from morning till evening. These children have taken the initiative for further education, on their own. Having travelled a fair distance on the road to being fully literate, they are facing setbacks in their path due to non-availability of study material in Kannada. They need full support from NIOS to pursue their dream of completing their education and get on a career path.""

NIOS reacts

When BM contacted Chandrashekar S, director of NIOS, Bengaluru branch, he said, ""There is Kannada up to 10th. The 10th class study materials and examinations will be bi-lingual and the students can answer in Kannada. There is no problem in that. The next set of Kannada books are getting ready. Once it is released, students will be getting it.""

KDA slams the system

Reacting to the limitations for Kannada medium students in NIOS, SG Siddaramaiah, Chairman, Kannada Development Authority told BM, ""What kind of unscientific methods are these? How can someone who knows only Kannada be made to read in English or Hindi and again write answers in Kannada? How is it even possible? Who is going to punish these type of people who deny access to education to Kannada medium students? This is coming to light now. What about all these years? Thousands of children have been denied education only because of this option.''

While Faridi continues her fight with NIOS, she's preparing her students to brace themselves for the language challenge ahead. She has already brought Hindi books from Delhi to prepare her students to learn from study materials in Hindi and English at the Std 10 level.

Why Open School?

Students who fail to qualify for regular school or are unable to pass a class despite multiple attempts have the option of completing studies through Open School. Also, mature students who wish to return to school after a break in studies or those children who have to shoulder the family's burden pursue studies through Open School.

Are questions set only in English or Hindi?

No. Seven other options are available apart from English and Hindi. These are Urdu, Marathi, Telugu, Gujarati, Malayalam, Odia and Tamil. Note that all South Indian languages are available except for Kannada.

Can they learn and answer in Kannada?

Yes, but only till Class 9. In Class 10, the questions are set only in Hindi or English which is highly unfair for students already struggling with the system.

How many students benefit from Open School?

Last year, 1,64,192 students completed Secondary (equivalent to Class 10) through Open School. Around 500 students study in Kannada each year."
