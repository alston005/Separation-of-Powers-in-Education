The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

Arti Qanungo (39) was shortlisted from among a lakh participants from 179 countries. A teacher at Government Girls Senior Secondary School, School Block, Shakarpur, Qanungo has been teaching for the last 17 years.

She began her career as a teacher at a civic body school before moving to a Delhi government school in 2010.

A mother of three, Qanungo is known for her innovative teaching ways. Last year, too, she was given a state award for best teacher, and had also received an award from a university in London.

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children. I would ask them to hear the announcement at railway stations, metro, radio and call centres. The strategy worked and students became very confident,"" Qanungo said.

It was her daughter who asked her to apply for the global award given by Varkey Foundation. ""My daughter got an Economic Times cutout and asked me to apply for it. I thought when my daughter was so confident, I should apply,"" Qanungo said.

The global award carries a cash amount of 1 million dollars and would be handed at an event in Dubai next March.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal congratulated her on Twitter for taking Delhi's education system to a global platform. Deputy CM Manish Sisodia also congratulated her.

Born and bought up in Delhi, Qanungo completed her schooling at Lilavati Vidya Mandir Shakti Nagar. She did her teachers training from District Institute of Education and Traning (DIET), Keshavpuram.

The 43-year-old Government Higher Primary School, Daddalkad, Bantwal taluk, was in a dilapidated condition in 2015 and had only 30 students. Now it has around 500 children, studying from LKG to class VIII, where English is taught along with Kannada.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

""When most Kannada-medium schools across the state are closing down due to various reasons, we wanted to show the world that this school can be saved by adopting new teaching skills, and today we are successful in doing so.

The first phase of the school with eight classrooms was inaugurated last April, and second and final phase will be inaugurated by governor Vajubhai Vala on January 5.

Anchan added that they collected all the money from generous donors, who included locals, parents and others. ""We have not taken a single penny from any government be it the Centre or state. When we proposed the same building plan, the government estimated a cost of Rs 6 crore, but we have completed the work by spending Rs 2.2 crore.""

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

Krithik, who studies at Cherry Creek High School at Greenwood village in Denver, was appalled at the sight of the school. ""My images were shattered when I stepped into the school. It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

When funds in hands, he approached the school management and asked them about their needs. Headmaster Perumal said installation of solar panels would help the school as it was affected by frequent power disruptions.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

Krithik said the solar panels could produce 2kw of power. ""The requirement of school is less than 2kw. It could sell excess power to the Tamil Nadu electricity board,"" he said.

Ramesh Babu said his son's idea was to build sustainable and renewable energy systems that would serve schools in India for decades. ""Our goal is to improve academic success and create self-sustaining solutions to build up a strong infrastructure,"" he said.

Krithik, who will return to the US by the end of the month, said, ""I will participate in more science fairs, will get more money and contribute something to government schools in India."" He also requested schoolteachers to contact his NGO when they need anything for their schools."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

Only around 5,000 students had satchels over the prescribed limit, a recent study conducted by the education department shows.

The survey covered 4.17 lakh students in over 23,000 government, corporation and zilla parishad schools from August till October.

Educationists were divided over the results. Some disbelieving experts said it was not possible that just one per cent students carried overweight bags. Others attributed the change in textbook sizes and planning for the reduced weight of the school bags.

The state government had issued a notification for lighter school bags on November 5, 2015. The principal and another representative would be responsible if any child was found with an overweight bag.

Senior officials in the education department said special squads conducted the survey in 37 districts of Maharashtra and 88,972 schools. As many as 4,308 officials were appointed three years ago.

The survey established that 98.77% students carried school bags as per the prescribed limit while 1.23% had overweight satchels. In Pune district, 5,030 schools and 13,950 students were surveyed and only 652 students were found to be carrying overweight bags.

The 15 districts included Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule, Nagpur, Mumbai.

Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said textbooks are now bigger in size with more pages but they should not weigh down school bags if there is proper planning by the school.

""Perceptions of those who don't trust the survey seem to be based on students going to private schools. My experience is that most educationists are out of touch with ground realities,"" Kalpande said.

""The weight of the bag of a Class III student studying in a CBSE school varies between 7 and 9 kg. This, according to the guidelines, should be between 2 and 3 kg. I personally weighed the bags of children studying in different classes, in different schools. I found that only in a few cases were the children carrying lighter bags,"" said Basudev Bhatt, convener of All Odisha Parents' Association.

In a letter to school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, Bhatt called for strict implementation of the guidelines and asked the state government to carry out random checks in schools.

""Due to the heavy weight of the school bags, most children complain of pain in the back, shoulder and problems of posture. Long-term distortion of the spinal cord is also possible. If departments conduct raids at regular intervals, things may improve,"" said Bhatt, adding that states such as Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were working actively to lighten students' bags.

A senior officer in the school and mass education department said on the condition of anonymity that the state government had issued an order asking schools to reduce the weight of school bags. ""Implementation has been a problem,"" the officer added.

The parents' association also asked the government to make schools follow the MHRD's and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)'s guidelines on not giving homework to children up to Class II. ""On one hand, we are talking about making learning joyous. On the other, we impose so much homework on our children every day. The government should look into the matter,"" said Bhatt.

The Confederation of Odisha Public Schools, however, said implementation of the guidelines was hardly possible in a practical manner.

""The recent guidelines of the MHRD have only been implemented in Lakshadweep. Most parents complain if we don't give homework to children.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

According to sources in the department, reducing the content in textbooks was one of the options put before the state government and was also discussed at various levels, including school management.

""Reducing the content will bring down the size and the weight of textbooks. We already have a research report and an expert committee report on how the weight of bags can be reduced.

All these recommendations will be discussed before any guidelines are issued prescribing the weight of bags,"" said a senior department official.

However, officials said that if the decision to reduce content was taken, it would be possible only during the next revision exercise for school textbooks, which could happen after three years. Meanwhile, based on the MHRD circular, the department has decided to form a committee which will visit schools and check for the usage of non-prescribed books.

The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class.

importance to martial arts training for girl students as part of its self-defence programme, this government higher secondary school in Kurichi has been a pioneer in the field with seven of its students getting ready to participate in a State-level meet to be held soon.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

At least 40,000 vans are plying without valid permits in the capital, of which around 25,000 are engaged as school cabs, according to data available with the Delhi government's transport department. However, only 9,600 school vans are registered with the department.

Despite several crackdowns against these cabs and unverified drivers, private vehicles plying as school vans continue to flout the guidelines mandated under the School Cab Policy, 2007.

The guidelines say that vehicle owners should have a commercial school cab licence. They fix a cap on the number of children to be ferried, list out safety precautions and mandate adequate and comfortable seating space, plus adequate ventilation in the van. The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher.

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft. The draft is almost over and I will submit it to the commissioner and the department and the department will give its final calls and issue the circulars to the schools."""

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents.

Last year during Teacher's Day celebration, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that the State Government will provide free uniforms to both BPL and APL students studying in State-run schools. Earlier, only students belonging to BPL families were getting uniforms.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA. Under the scheme, government spends '400 for two pairs of uniforms per child belonging to BPL category. As no funds were sanctioned for buying uniforms for APL students, the school management committees decided to divert some funds for the purpose.

Sources said there was verbal instruction by officials of the School and Mass Education department to do so. As a result, instead of spending '400 on buying two pairs of uniforms, the schools spent '120 to '150 to purchase one pair of substandard quality uniform for the BPL students.

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

Terming the transfer order a vendetta against serving teacher Sukerna, the parents alleged that the latter didn't not get a prior notice about her transfer or Sakshi's appointment and neither did the principal receive any official communication in this regard.

""The government should reverse the transfer order of the current English teacher. The school result is already very good and there was no need to transfer the teacher. Secondly, there was no prior notice about the transfer order and the new teacher came for her joining the very next day of the issuance of the order,"" parents said, which included Raj Kumar, Binita Devi, Karan Singh, Anil Kumar and Rajlakshmi.

The drama continued till district education officer (secondary) Himmat Singh Hundal intervened in the matter and pacified the parents and students. The school gate was unlocked on Thursday. Hundal said, ""There was some confusion over the transfer of the teacher. The new teacher is a regular and the transfer is purely departmental. The transfer order was dispatched to the school principal and the teacher. The new teacher came for the joining as per the transfer orders."""

SSA sources said Centre has only released 34% of total funds allocated to the state to run schemes under SSA. Considering this shortage, the officials at SSA have taken a decision to lower the supply of uniforms for the next academic year.

Funds allocated from the Centre under SSA was Rs 1,700 crore for 2018-19, of which it has only received Rs 577 crore. ""Even of this Rs 577 crore, what we got only Rs 370 crore in the first phase.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

""The no-detention policy, where students are not detained till class 8, has done significant harm to the quality of education. Teaching also has to be more holistic and focused on ensuring that every child at least gains basic education levels,"" said an educator."

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar"

The results of Olympiad, conducted by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, however, showed that teachers of private schools that charge an annual fee above '10,000 were better communicators.

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are largely on a par with national averages, said Anjali. For example, national averages in 2017 for classroom practice and professional competencies and logical ability and communication were 35 per cent, 38 per cent and 47 per cent respectively, while the same for Tamil Nadu government teachers were 32 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.

Lande added, ""Uniforms are given under the Samagra Shikshan scheme of the Union government. The scheme requires 100% Aadhaar linking. At the start of the academic year, it was decided that DBT will be applicable from 2019-20 academic year.""

However, Vishal Solanki, the commissioner of education, assured that no child will be deprived of the benefits for the want of an Aadhaar card. ""We will not deprive any child of the benefits of our schemes. Aadhaar is a necessity for our online system where every child is defined by a unique number and bogus students are eliminated,"" he said.

Activists, however, have objected to the decision. Matin Mujawar of Shikshan Hakka Manch, said, ""The government does not require these administrative practices to operate the scheme. Just distribute the uniforms and stationery to students in classrooms."""

The allegations have surfaced despite an earlier order of OPEPA directing schools, which have received more than Rs 5,000 for purchase of uniforms and shoes, to sign an agreement with one of the GST registered distributors in their locality besides maintaining all procurement details in record books to ensure that there is no compromise with the quality.""

This is what changed","India Today",FALSE,"The Delhi government has sent school teachers and coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US to get an exposure of the teaching methods adopted there.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

Deepti Chawla, Rajikiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar; Kapila Parashar, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara; Rashmi Grover, Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar; Gaurav Kumar, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 1; Neeru Lohiya, Government Girls Senior Secondary School Sector 4, RK Puram, and Kadambiri Lohiya, teacher/co-ordinator at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Gandhi Nagar were among those who witnessed the advanced teaching methods at educational institutions in Singapore, as well as visited the Museum of Education, which showcases the evolution of the education system.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

The education department is aware of the state of affairs but is yet to replace the sheds housing primary and pre-primary students with a proper building. The remaining classes do run in buildings but lack the space to accommodate these students.

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Authorities from other government schools said these buildings have never been renovated.

""We have to save documents after the rain as the roof leaks. So many letters have been written but nothing has been done,"" said an official, requesting anonymity.

""There is hardly any school that does not have the problem of water seepage and leaking roofs. One room or the other is always facing a problem,"" said Savinder Singh, chairman, Joint action committee of teachers.

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma expressed shock upon learning of the segregation of students along caste and religious lines at a government-run school.

""It is very unfortunate if it is really happening. I have ordered a thorough investigation of the matter. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for it,"" he added."

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR). The school thus got two toilets that cost Rs 3.5 lakh each,"" said Ratnoo.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

Jay Narayan Gehlot, sarpanch of Chopasni village, said that the entire village made it a vision to give a good school to the children of the village. ""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

Only around 5,000 students had satchels over the prescribed limit, a recent study conducted by the education department shows.

The survey covered 4.17 lakh students in over 23,000 government, corporation and zilla parishad schools from August till October.

Educationists were divided over the results. Some disbelieving experts said it was not possible that just one per cent students carried overweight bags. Others attributed the change in textbook sizes and planning for the reduced weight of the school bags.

The state government had issued a notification for lighter school bags on November 5, 2015. The principal and another representative would be responsible if any child was found with an overweight bag.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported. These include Bal Bharati School in Dwarka, St Marks Senior Secondary School in Meera Bagh, and Springdales, Dhaula Kuan."

According to sources in the department, reducing the content in textbooks was one of the options put before the state government and was also discussed at various levels, including school management.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher. In a meeting last year, the transport minister had agreed to waive off these charges. But no notification in this regard has been released so far,"" Jai Singh Chaudhry, vice-president, Delhi School Cabs Association, said."

The protest is a fall out after a female teacher was sought to be transferred to Karvem from the government primary school, Nuem, Shristhal.

The parents of students from the Nuem school had held a dharna before Diwali vacations and complained against the female teacher. Expressing dissatisfaction with her teaching abilities, they had also alleged that she used abusive language in the classroom.

They had demanded that the teacher be transferred and a new one posted in her place or else their wards would stay away from school.

Deputy director (education, South Goa) Uday Gaonkar had visited the school and had assured parents that a proper decision would be taken after Diwali vacation. And her transfer to GPS Karvem followed.

On Tuesday, the parents categorically stated that they would not send their wards to class till the teacher was transferred. The parents waited till 11am, as ADEI, Ganesh Shet visited the school and informed the parents that the transfer decision has been been taken by higher authorities.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Swati Patil, another parent and activist who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on this issue, said, ""We have learnt that only schools in urban areas are aware of these norms.""

However, there are some parents who feel the introduction of lockers by school has helped their kids to some extent. Lockers allow children to keep books in schools.

A parent of a Class V student of a civic-run school said, ""Earlier, my children used to carry their textbooks to school from home. But now their school has brought cupboards to keep the textbook. This has brought great relief to us as even we too have experienced discomfort carrying heavy school bags while dropping our children to school in the morning."""

At a meeting of the deputy commissioners, chief executive officers (CEO) of zilla panchayat and the secretaries of all departments, Kumaraswamy was apprised by his ministerial colleague Sa Ra Mahesh over the poor quality of cycles being distributed to the 5.14 lakh students across the state.

Mahesh, at the meeting, told the CM that the cycles were so brittle that they became scrap within a few months of use. To this, Kumaraswamy sought an explanation from the education department principal secretary Shalini Rajneesh, who blamed the district officials of the department. He claimed that the companies provided samples of the best quality to them in Bengaluru, however, quality checks on the same were not taken up by the district level deputy directors for public instructions (DDPI), resulting in poor quality cycles being distributed to school children of class VIII to class X.

On hearing the explanation, CM Kumaraswamy directed the department to stop the supply of these poor quality cycles and halt all payments to the company supplying it.

Later, speaking to the media, Kumaraswamy said: ""There is a complaint over poor quality of cycles being supplied to the children, as a result of which I have directed the officials to hold a departmental inquiry into the matter.""

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft. The draft is almost over and I will submit it to the commissioner and the department and the department will give its final calls and issue the circulars to the schools."""

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA.

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them.

Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here. In fact, admissions in the nearby corporation, and even private, schools have come down because of this."

Referring to recent attempts by women to enter the temple, Muraleedharan said they are individuals who led campaigns such as the 'Kiss of Love' in Kerala. Hitting out at RSS on the Sabarimala temple issue, K. Muraleedharan said that the RSS has no real faith.

""The government is sparing no effort to ensure the safety of all devotees and pilgrims. Law and order should prevail in Sabarimala, peace should prevail. Amit Shah's wishes will not be fulfilled in Kerala. The Congress is going to destroy itself by aligning with the BJP on the issue.

The council had to be nominated because, without it, Rs15 crore fund allotted for the project would have lapsed. The process of selecting the system integrator had to be otherwise done through competitive bidding.

Earlier, when the government had nominated Akshay Patra for the distribution of midday meals in government schools and asked former lieutenant governor Najeeb Jung for his approval for the allocation of land to build the kitchen, he had turned it down stating that no opportunity was to be given to other NGOs.

During the 2018 budget, a fund of Rs15 crore was allotted for the evaluation and ranking of over 5,000 schools, both government and private, on four broad parameters -- safety, teaching-learning, community participation and social inclusion. Earlier, DCPCR had said the results would be announced in November, but now, due to the delay in getting the system integrator, the date has been extended.

For the project, DCPCR had constituted working group comprising representatives from Directorate of Education, east, north and south corporations, New Delhi Municipal Council, SCERT/DIETs, Delhi Cantonment Board, private schools and civil society organisations.

At a meeting of the state advisory council held in September and the minutes of the meeting confirmed on October 10 that the decision to nominate QCI was taken.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added."

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

""The no-detention policy, where students are not detained till class 8, has done significant harm to the quality of education. Teaching also has to be more holistic and focused on ensuring that every child at least gains basic education levels,"" said an educator."

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar"

The results of Olympiad, conducted by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, however, showed that teachers of private schools that charge an annual fee above '10,000 were better communicators.

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

Deepti Chawla, Rajikiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar; Kapila Parashar, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara; Rashmi Grover, Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar; Gaurav Kumar, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 1; Neeru Lohiya, Government Girls Senior Secondary School Sector 4, RK Puram, and Kadambiri Lohiya, teacher/co-ordinator at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Gandhi Nagar were among those who witnessed the advanced teaching methods at educational institutions in Singapore, as well as visited the Museum of Education, which showcases the evolution of the education system.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

This shows that the department itself has not taken any major step besides issuing advisory in the case. ""She did not delay taking the action. The moment parents of the survivor told her, she immediately reported the incident to the police,"" a senior official told TOI.

However, this does not match with the statement the in-charge gave to the CCPCR. In her statement, she had said that after the parents reported the matter on October 22 she handed over the case to the school's sexual harassment committee. Then the in-charge telephonically reported the matter to the DEO office. However, a letter was also given to the DEO on October 25.

As per former members of the commission, inclusion of officials from the UT education department, health and other departments in the CCPCR has led to show leniency in a serious case. ""Last time when it was a private school head at fault, an FIR was recommended because that is what the Pocso Act states and this time CCPCR just saved itself and left it to the department to act,"" said a member requesting anonymity.

As per the inquiry, the school head, education department officials and the doctors who examined the girl did not report the matter to the police. Copies of the letters are with TOI.

In November, TOI had reported that the commission has refrained itself from recommending action against the persons in question for delay in reporting the case as suggested in the Juvenile Justice Act and had left it to the concerned authorities to decide the punishment. Notably, this is the first time that the child rights commission has shown leniency in a serious case and not recommended FIR against every person from doctors to school heads and education department officials who did not report the matter to the police as per the Act suggests.

As per the information, this was done because the school authorities were found to be unaware about the law that applied in such a case.

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources.

Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school.

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground.

""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

The survey established that 98.77% students carried school bags as per the prescribed limit while 1.23% had overweight satchels. In Pune district, 5,030 schools and 13,950 students were surveyed and only 652 students were found to be carrying overweight bags.

The 15 districts included Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule, Nagpur, Mumbai.

Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said textbooks are now bigger in size with more pages but they should not weigh down school bags if there is proper planning by the school.

""Perceptions of those who don't trust the survey seem to be based on students going to private schools. My experience is that most educationists are out of touch with ground realities,"" Kalpande said.

Spokesperson of Aam Admi Party in Pune Mukund Kirdat said, "" We see students waiting at bus stops every day with their bags hanging low on their backs indicating their load."""

They alleged that most government or private schools in the state were not implementing the MHRD's guidelines on reducing the weight of school bags.

""The weight of the bag of a Class III student studying in a CBSE school varies between 7 and 9 kg. This, according to the guidelines, should be between 2 and 3 kg. I personally weighed the bags of children studying in different classes, in different schools. I found that only in a few cases were the children carrying lighter bags,"" said Basudev Bhatt, convener of All Odisha Parents' Association.

In a letter to school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, Bhatt called for strict implementation of the guidelines and asked the state government to carry out random checks in schools.

""Due to the heavy weight of the school bags, most children complain of pain in the back, shoulder and problems of posture. Long-term distortion of the spinal cord is also possible. If departments conduct raids at regular intervals, things may improve,"" said Bhatt, adding that states such as Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were working actively to lighten students' bags.

A senior officer in the school and mass education department said on the condition of anonymity that the state government had issued an order asking schools to reduce the weight of school bags. ""Implementation has been a problem,"" the officer added.

The parents' association also asked the government to make schools follow the MHRD's and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)'s guidelines on not giving homework to children up to Class II. ""On one hand, we are talking about making learning joyous. On the other, we impose so much homework on our children every day. The government should look into the matter,"" said Bhatt.

The Confederation of Odisha Public Schools, however, said implementation of the guidelines was hardly possible in a practical manner.

""The recent guidelines of the MHRD have only been implemented in Lakshadweep. Most parents complain if we don't give homework to children. They want to go through the textbooks to see what the schools have been teaching. Only guidelines won't do, we must be practical,"" said chairman of the confederation, B N Patnaik, while admitting that children carried heavy school bags.

He added, ""The CBSE issued a guideline that said the weight of the school bags should not exceed 4 kg, provided the children use NCERT books. But is the NCERT able to provide all the textbooks? If children don't have access to NCERT textbooks, they have to use many other textbooks,"" Patnaik said."

Principals, head teachers and teachers are spearheading the change with the help of philanthropists.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

Government Primary School, Nathewal

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported.

The school is located in PMC Colony area near the Patil Estate slum which suffered a fire incident three days ago. The children running in the corridors are not on campus for education but for mere survival after losing their entire households in the fire.

""Most of the children in the school are from Patil Estate. The school was informed about the incident and the required arrangement was made a little after 2pm (The fire brigade received a call at 1.10pm).

""In fact, the number goes up in the evenings as everyone is looking for space to sleep,"" she added on Friday.

Thursday, Friday and Saturday (half day) of the school work was lost for the 650-700 students of the school. The pupils missing academic work include ones studying in English, Marathi and Urdu medium.

The principal of the school, Anjali Mandhale, was on leave when the incident happened and the school was headed by Ujwala Nangre, vice principal, in her absence.

Ganesh Sonune, disaster management department officer at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) said government structures for such situations are pre-identified and people are shifted there and provided with water, sanitation and food.

""That is the protocol. For example, people were provided with blankets and donations from us as well as private organisations. If needed, private halls and open private spaces are taken into consideration as well.

The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class.

importance to martial arts training for girl students as part of its self-defence programme, this government higher secondary school in Kurichi has been a pioneer in the field with seven of its students getting ready to participate in a State-level meet to be held soon.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

At least 40,000 vans are plying without valid permits in the capital, of which around 25,000 are engaged as school cabs, according to data available with the Delhi government's transport department. However, only 9,600 school vans are registered with the department.

Despite several crackdowns against these cabs and unverified drivers, private vehicles plying as school vans continue to flout the guidelines mandated under the School Cab Policy, 2007.

The guidelines say that vehicle owners should have a commercial school cab licence. They fix a cap on the number of children to be ferried, list out safety precautions and mandate adequate and comfortable seating space, plus adequate ventilation in the van. The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher.

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

At a meeting of the deputy commissioners, chief executive officers (CEO) of zilla panchayat and the secretaries of all departments, Kumaraswamy was apprised by his ministerial colleague Sa Ra Mahesh over the poor quality of cycles being distributed to the 5.14 lakh students across the state.

Mahesh, at the meeting, told the CM that the cycles were so brittle that they became scrap within a few months of use. To this, Kumaraswamy sought an explanation from the education department principal secretary Shalini Rajneesh, who blamed the district officials of the department. He claimed that the companies provided samples of the best quality to them in Bengaluru, however, quality checks on the same were not taken up by the district level deputy directors for public instructions (DDPI), resulting in poor quality cycles being distributed to school children of class VIII to class X.

On hearing the explanation, CM Kumaraswamy directed the department to stop the supply of these poor quality cycles and halt all payments to the company supplying it.

Later, speaking to the media, Kumaraswamy said: ""There is a complaint over poor quality of cycles being supplied to the children, as a result of which I have directed the officials to hold a departmental inquiry into the matter.""

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft.

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city. The students were from Class V to Class XII.The survey found no significant difference in the intake of fruits and vegetables between girls and boys. ""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents. What we can do is to make them aware of the benefits of healthy eating. But, in the end they will follow the dietary routine of their house,"" she said.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA. Under the scheme, government spends '400 for two pairs of uniforms per child belonging to BPL category.

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

English medium in govt schools will not harm Tamil

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

Removing revenue and non-revenue barriers to African produce would give African agriculture a fighting chance. We can achieve a lot in collaboration with the rest of the world and yet we must realize that a lot rests within our own capacity to achieve as Africans.

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar"

The results of Olympiad, conducted by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, however, showed that teachers of private schools that charge an annual fee above '10,000 were better communicators.

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are largely on a par with national averages, said Anjali. For example, national averages in 2017 for classroom practice and professional competencies and logical ability and communication were 35 per cent, 38 per cent and 47 per cent respectively, while the same for Tamil Nadu government teachers were 32 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.

The children are taking steps numbered from one to 10, ensuring they learn basic counting faster and with active engagement.

That is not all. After assimilating the numbers, children are taught fine motor skills and the ability to concentrate by climbing 15 steps on a wooden ladder.

He added that he planned to introduce the concept in all government schools that offer pre-primary classes.

""I have spent around Rs15,000 from my own pocket to get the infrastructure and the slides ready for the project,"" he adds.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

""English is a subject in which students in our government schools don't feel very comfortable. I diagnosed the problem and developed a strategy. Rather than making it a subject confined to reading and writing, I worked on developing listening skills of the children.

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

The school has five government-appointed teachers, three guest teachers, three vehicle drivers, and Karate, dance and music teachers. About16 staff are paid by the Shree Durga Friends Club members. All the facilities are provided free-of-cost to children, including transportation.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same. From a single village we managed to bring 50-60 new students to join the school, ""said Suresh.

Sarla Ratnoo, a student of class 12, said: ""I can dream big now as I can continue with my education. Had the school been far away or without facilities, it would not have been possible.""

The school has a strength of more than 350 students and provides Identity cards and uniforms. ""CCTV cameras have been installed in the classes. The teachers and I keep watch over every activity in the school. We keep organising sports and other extra-curricular activities from time to time to give boost students' exposure,"" said the proud principal."

It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

When funds in hands, he approached the school management and asked them about their needs. Headmaster Perumal said installation of solar panels would help the school as it was affected by frequent power disruptions.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

""The school is incurring about Rs 15,000 as electricity charges every two months. With solar panels, we can save that money,"" said a teacher, on the condition of anonymity.

Krithik said the solar panels could produce 2kw of power. ""The requirement of school is less than 2kw. It could sell excess power to the Tamil Nadu electricity board,"" he said.

Ramesh Babu said his son's idea was to build sustainable and renewable energy systems that would serve schools in India for decades. ""Our goal is to improve academic success and create self-sustaining solutions to build up a strong infrastructure,"" he said.

Krithik, who will return to the US by the end of the month, said, ""I will participate in more science fairs, will get more money and contribute something to government schools in India."" He also requested schoolteachers to contact his NGO when they need anything for their schools."

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

Only around 5,000 students had satchels over the prescribed limit, a recent study conducted by the education department shows.

The survey covered 4.17 lakh students in over 23,000 government, corporation and zilla parishad schools from August till October.

Educationists were divided over the results. Some disbelieving experts said it was not possible that just one per cent students carried overweight bags. Others attributed the change in textbook sizes and planning for the reduced weight of the school bags.

The state government had issued a notification for lighter school bags on November 5, 2015. The principal and another representative would be responsible if any child was found with an overweight bag.

Senior officials in the education department said special squads conducted the survey in 37 districts of Maharashtra and 88,972 schools. As many as 4,308 officials were appointed three years ago.

The survey established that 98.77% students carried school bags as per the prescribed limit while 1.23% had overweight satchels. In Pune district, 5,030 schools and 13,950 students were surveyed and only 652 students were found to be carrying overweight bags.

The 15 districts included Nashik, Nandurbar, Dhule, Nagpur, Mumbai.

Former director of education Vasant Kalpande said textbooks are now bigger in size with more pages but they should not weigh down school bags if there is proper planning by the school.

""Perceptions of those who don't trust the survey seem to be based on students going to private schools. My experience is that most educationists are out of touch with ground realities,"" Kalpande said.

""The weight of the bag of a Class III student studying in a CBSE school varies between 7 and 9 kg. This, according to the guidelines, should be between 2 and 3 kg. I personally weighed the bags of children studying in different classes, in different schools. I found that only in a few cases were the children carrying lighter bags,"" said Basudev Bhatt, convener of All Odisha Parents' Association.

In a letter to school and mass education minister Badri Narayan Patra, Bhatt called for strict implementation of the guidelines and asked the state government to carry out random checks in schools.

""Due to the heavy weight of the school bags, most children complain of pain in the back, shoulder and problems of posture. Long-term distortion of the spinal cord is also possible. If departments conduct raids at regular intervals, things may improve,"" said Bhatt, adding that states such as Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Delhi were working actively to lighten students' bags.

A senior officer in the school and mass education department said on the condition of anonymity that the state government had issued an order asking schools to reduce the weight of school bags. ""Implementation has been a problem,"" the officer added.

The parents' association also asked the government to make schools follow the MHRD's and the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE)'s guidelines on not giving homework to children up to Class II. ""On one hand, we are talking about making learning joyous. On the other, we impose so much homework on our children every day. The government should look into the matter,"" said Bhatt.

The Confederation of Odisha Public Schools, however, said implementation of the guidelines was hardly possible in a practical manner.

""The recent guidelines of the MHRD have only been implemented in Lakshadweep. Most parents complain if we don't give homework to children.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

He has now been asked to guide other schools in the district"

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported. These include Bal Bharati School in Dwarka, St Marks Senior Secondary School in Meera Bagh, and Springdales, Dhaula Kuan."

According to sources in the department, reducing the content in textbooks was one of the options put before the state government and was also discussed at various levels, including school management.

The government primary school in Bandemma Nagar near Naragund town once had a good numbers of students but after locals started to migrate, the school was left with only three children.

The teacher, H S Sunkad, hails from Naragund and he was appointed on deputation to this school four months ago.A few years ago, Bandemma Nagar had several families living here and many children went to the school. However, most of the residents got houses under a Central government scheme and left the village.

The three children continue to come to school, thanks to their dedicated teacher. ""When I first came here, I was surprised to see only three students. But it is my duty as a teacher to teach, irrespective of the number of students. I teach all the children in the same class.

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face. After being briefed about the different forms of martial arts, many girls volunteered to be trained in fencing; they also managed to win a few

medals, he recalls.

Five girls -- S Swetha, D Mercy, R Ranjani, of class XI, and Rajeshwari (class X) and K Logeshwari (class IX) -- have been qualified to participate in the State-level event to be held soon in Kankeyam

of Tirupur district. The girls, on their part, are happy to have overcome all odds to make a mark in the

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

mother M Gowri are quite simple. Raising her two girls -- M Praveena and M Durgadevi -- on her own, after the demise of her husband, she wanted them to be fiercely independent. When the school

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

Despite several crackdowns against these cabs and unverified drivers, private vehicles plying as school vans continue to flout the guidelines mandated under the School Cab Policy, 2007.

The guidelines say that vehicle owners should have a commercial school cab licence. They fix a cap on the number of children to be ferried, list out safety precautions and mandate adequate and comfortable seating space, plus adequate ventilation in the van. The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher.

The minister also said the guidelines to lower the weight of school bags have been issued in view of ill effects of heavy bags on children's health.

""Leading doctors have said that heavy bags can lead to back pain, depression, spinal problems, pain in the neck, among others. These can have an adverse impact on children's mental and physical well-being, and hence this decision,"" he added."

At a meeting of the deputy commissioners, chief executive officers (CEO) of zilla panchayat and the secretaries of all departments, Kumaraswamy was apprised by his ministerial colleague Sa Ra Mahesh over the poor quality of cycles being distributed to the 5.14 lakh students across the state.

Mahesh, at the meeting, told the CM that the cycles were so brittle that they became scrap within a few months of use. To this, Kumaraswamy sought an explanation from the education department principal secretary Shalini Rajneesh, who blamed the district officials of the department. He claimed that the companies provided samples of the best quality to them in Bengaluru, however, quality checks on the same were not taken up by the district level deputy directors for public instructions (DDPI), resulting in poor quality cycles being distributed to school children of class VIII to class X.

On hearing the explanation, CM Kumaraswamy directed the department to stop the supply of these poor quality cycles and halt all payments to the company supplying it.

Later, speaking to the media, Kumaraswamy said: ""There is a complaint over poor quality of cycles being supplied to the children, as a result of which I have directed the officials to hold a departmental inquiry into the matter.""

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft. The draft is almost over and I will submit it to the commissioner and the department and the department will give its final calls and issue the circulars to the schools."""

The Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), which compiled the report titled Survey of Fruits, Vegetables and Juice Intake of School Children, Nutritionists and Dieticians, found that students in government schools consumed around 250 grams of vegetables in a day while those in private schools had only 210 grams.

The National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, recommends that a person should consume at least 300 grams of vegetables a day. Of this, according to NIN guidelines, 50 grams each must constitute leafy vegetables and tubers, while 200 grams should be other vegetables. The institute also recommends intake of 100 grams of fresh fruits.

""Schoolchildren need maximum nutrition and deficiency of micronutrients leads to fatigued learning. Non-consumption of vegetables leads to deficiency of micronutrients, which significantly affects learning abilities. Hence, it is important for schoolchildren to have the required amount of vegetables (micronutrients),"" said Dr YG Deosthale, former director of NIN.

The ICRIER, as a part of the survey, studied the dietary habits of 98, 596 students across 36 government schools and 54 private schools in the city.

""More than 56 per cent students enrolled in Classes V to XII in Delhi-NCR consumed lesser green vegetables than what is mandated. And, only over one-fourth of the students ate fruits daily,"" the report said.

However, according to the report, students in private schools consumed more fruits that those enrolled in government schools. ""While 34 per cent of students enrolled in private schools ate fruits daily, only 25 per cent of those in government schools consumed fruits,"" the report said.

The principal of a private school said that it was not the school's duty to instruct kids on what to eat. ""Almost all students eat what they are told to by parents.

However, no funds were sanctioned under Sarva Siksha Abhiyan (SSA) for purchasing uniforms for APL students. On the other hand, the SSA sanctioned '6.44 crore in the academic year of 2017-18 to procure uniforms for 1.61 lakh students. There are a total of 40,000 APL students in the district.

There are 1,381 government-run primary and upper primary schools in the district that get funds under SSA. Under the scheme, government spends '400 for two pairs of uniforms per child belonging to BPL category. As no funds were sanctioned for buying uniforms for APL students, the school management committees decided to divert some funds for the purpose.

Sources said there was verbal instruction by officials of the School and Mass Education department to do so. As a result, instead of spending '400 on buying two pairs of uniforms, the schools spent '120 to '150 to purchase one pair of substandard quality uniform for the BPL students.

English medium classes were opened here eight years ago when the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa allowed their parallel sections from the first standard. Since then, the demand has increased and gradually, it became a fully English medium.

The school, established 158 years ago, used to be the primary section of the Government Girls Higher Secondary School at PS Park, Erode. In 2001, it was made a separate school with a separate head. Most primary schools in the State are run by local bodies. In fact, there are only 27 primary schools, including three in Erode district, directly under the government. Of the three in the district, two are in the city and one in Bhavanisagar.

When the present headmaster, V S Muthuramasamy, took charge, its strength was 72, but now there are 310 students, more than 200 of them being girls. It has 10 teachers, all of whom are postgraduates; three of them, including the headmaster, have an MPhil degree. However, Plus Two with DTEd is the basic qualification for teachers of primary schools.

All classes from the first to the fifth standard have two sections, each with 25-30 students. So, the school has just enough number of teachers.

Good infrastructure

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students.

Terming the transfer order a vendetta against serving teacher Sukerna, the parents alleged that the latter didn't not get a prior notice about her transfer or Sakshi's appointment and neither did the principal receive any official communication in this regard.

""The government should reverse the transfer order of the current English teacher. The school result is already very good and there was no need to transfer the teacher.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches.

What's worse is that they cannot even do basic arithmetic, like adding or subtracting single digit numbers!

Top sources in the education department told TOI: ""Of the estimated 21 lakh students surveyed in classes 6-8, nearly 6 lakh students cannot do basic reading, writing or basic arithmetic.""

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

""The no-detention policy, where students are not detained till class 8, has done significant harm to the quality of education. Teaching also has to be more holistic and focused on ensuring that every child at least gains basic education levels,"" said an educator."

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar"

The results of Olympiad, conducted by the Centre for Teacher Accreditation (CENTA) and Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, however, showed that teachers of private schools that charge an annual fee above '10,000 were better communicators.

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are largely on a par with national averages, said Anjali. For example, national averages in 2017 for classroom practice and professional competencies and logical ability and communication were 35 per cent, 38 per cent and 47 per cent respectively, while the same for Tamil Nadu government teachers were 32 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.

So far, 119 Delhi government school principals have attended the 10-day Leadership Improving Performance at Cambridge.

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government has increased its teacher's training budget more than 11 times from Rs 9 crore to Rs 102 crore. ""We fundamentally believe that unless teachers & principals are not exposed to world-class education, we cannot expect the same or better from them,"" he further added.

The Deputy Chief Minister told the principals they would get a chance to visit schools there and they should form an understanding about the autonomy and accountability of schools."

This is what changed","India Today",FALSE,"The Delhi government has sent school teachers and coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US to get an exposure of the teaching methods adopted there.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

Deepti Chawla, Rajikiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar; Kapila Parashar, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara; Rashmi Grover, Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar; Gaurav Kumar, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 1; Neeru Lohiya, Government Girls Senior Secondary School Sector 4, RK Puram, and Kadambiri Lohiya, teacher/co-ordinator at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Gandhi Nagar were among those who witnessed the advanced teaching methods at educational institutions in Singapore, as well as visited the Museum of Education, which showcases the evolution of the education system.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.

The latest data from the Unified District Information System for Education (U-DISE), a database of information about schools, says that the situation is particularly grim in states such as Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, West Bengal, and some north-eastern states, as per 2016-17 statistics.

In these states, the percentage of students dropping out of school in secondary classes was considerably higher than the previous years. For example, in Bihar, in 2016-17, 39.73 per cent students in secondary classes withdrew from school, as compared to just 25.90 per cent students in 2015-16.

In Jharkhand, 36.64 per cent students dropped out in 2016-17, the last year for which data is available, which is over 12 per cent more than the previous year. The Union Human Resources Development Ministry has been boasting about making significant changes in the school education sector.

It's own figures, however, suggest that while the gross enrolment ratio was over 100 per cent at the primary level in 2016-17 (GER can be more than 100 per cent at the primary level because of overage and underage children taking admissions), it Is less than 80 per cent at the secondary level and is yet to reach 60 per cent at the senior secondary level.

Education experts said that while lack of access in rural areas and lack of interest in learning are major factors why children in higher classes drop out of schools, the no-detention policy till class VIII, which was introduced as part of the Right to Education act, could also be a reason.

""The government has now moved to end the no-detention policy, but in the past many year, it has been seen that children who were not assessed properly till class VIII, lose interest in studies when they don't do well at higher level examinations,"" said educationist Varsha Narain."

It was all possible because of the efforts and foresight of Shree Durga Friends Club, Karenki, led by Prakash Anchan, a garment merchant from Bantwal.

Success story

In 2015, when the school was about to shut down, the Shree Durga Friends Club members swung into action. They made their own children quit from English-medium schools and admitted them to the school, due to which their number rose to 56 from 30. The members later sought permission from the department of public instruction to convert the medium of instruction to English. It has adopted teaching in the English-medium in a Kannada school, which is a model similar to what is followed in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. The club is in a five-year agreement with the government to run the school in various capacities.

Earlier, the school had only three teachers appointed by the government. After taking over, club members have recruited additional teachers, and the club pays their salaries. It has transportation and other facilities."

In 2015, CCPCR had acted the other way and recommended FIR against the school management of a private Chandigarh school for delaying to report the molestation case of a pre-primary student. The conductor of the school bus had molested a kindergarten student in the bus. Recently, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed a lower court to proceed against a the school principal who had failed to act even after knowing about the molestation.

The JJ Act states under Section 19 (1) that any person who has the apprehension that an offence is likely to be committed or has the knowledge that an offence has been committed, should bring the incident to the notice of the special juvenile police unit or the local police. The failure to report such an offence is punishable with imprisonment or fine or both.

Failing to report the commission of an offence under Section 19 (1) or failing to record such offence under section 19 (2) is punishable under Section 21

(2) which states that any person, being in-charge of any company or an institution (by whatever name called) who fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year and with fine.

CCPCR chairperson Harjinder Kaur could not be reached for comment."

There are eight rooms under the shed in Hallomajra. These include all sections of Classes VI, VIIA and VIIIA. In the evening, all sections of Class I are also conducted under the roof.

In Hallomajra, one class is held in the midday meal room. The block under the tin roof is located on a separate premises. A rickety fence passes off for a boundary wall, leaving students vulnerable to insects and snakes.

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma expressed shock upon learning of the segregation of students along caste and religious lines at a government-run school.

""It is very unfortunate if it is really happening. I have ordered a thorough investigation of the matter. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for it,"" he added."

Several people from the village who shifted to Jodhpur city just to provide better education to their wards have returned to the village. Some private schools in the area have shut down due to shortage of students, say villagers. The Chopasni Government School is getting students from nearby villages, too, said block education officer Manohar Singh.

The school's transformation began in 2015 when an alumnus, Himmat Singh Ratnoo, became its principal. The school has recorded 100% results since then. The school has a projector room, computer labs, CCTV cameras, library and RO water facility.

""My first aim was to bring the children out of the inferiority complex of studying in a government school. Along with the villagers, I wrote a letter to ONGC and HPCL requesting help to construct two separate toilets for girls and boys as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR).

""Several girls who dropped out after a certain age due to lack of toilet facilities in school returned to study here,"" said Tima Ram Dhandhu, a villager.

""The next step was ensuring sufficient number of teachers. At present, there are 17 teachers in the school. I contacted several philanthropists and wrote letters to many others requesting financial assistance. The Rotary Club donated a projector and we raised over Rs 4 lakh to construct gated boundary walls and a prayer ground. Several others, including the village panchayat, contributed to construct classrooms in the school and install CCTV cameras,"" said Ratnoo.

""Having a school like this in a village like ours where the health facilities could not reach is an achievement. The entire village made it a vision to get better education facilities for our children. The panchayat collected money to make four new rooms in the school,"" said Gehlot.

Suresh Ratnoo, panchayat shayak, said he went door-to-door along with the teachers of the school explaining the developments in the school to the villages and motivating children, especially girls, to join the school. ""We told the people that the school has better education facilities and toilets. Now the number of girls and boys who study in the school is almost the same.

It was unclean and did not have adequate amenities. Schoolteachers there said this was the state of many government schools in India. That's when I decided to do something,"" he said.

With help from his grandfather and his father M Ramesh Babu, Krithik, an Overseas Citizen of India, started an NGO, Empowering Rural India Foundation, about two weeks ago. When funds became an issue, his family members suggested him to find sponsors.

But the 16-year-old donated his own money of 6,000 US dollars. ""In May, I won the first prize in an international science fair held in Pittsburgh and received a cash award of 3,000 US dollars. Besides, I decided to put another 3,000 US dollars from my savings,"" he said.

Krithik immediately accepted the idea and started searching for companies that install solar panels along with his father and mother Karpagavalli. They zeroed in on one and installed solar panels recently.

In the confines of Pongalur, this former government-aided school teacher has dedicated her verdant eight-and-a-half acre to hundreds of trees. The moniker Marangalin Thayar (Mother of Trees) is not without cause, you find.

V Thayammal (75), upon retirement, wanted nothing more than to spend the rest of her life amidst the lush vibrancy of trees. Even before it was time for retirement, she broke her savings (against everyone's well-intentioned advice to the contrary) to purchase this piece of land and begin the arduous process of cultivation. Now, after years of patience and toil, her land now boasts a huge collection of coconut, forest neem, perumaram, tamarind, marudhamaram, white apple, aathi maram, pomegranate and lemon trees, besides maize, onion, pavazhamalligai and a few medicinal plants.

Residing in Solipalayam, she now frequently visits her land to check on her trees. This is the one thing that brings her peace amidst a fast-moving life, she says. Thayammal recalls how all her colleagues had advised against investing money on agricultural land. However, it was the support of her husband Narayanasamy (now deceased) that helped her stick to the plan and fulfil her dream, she explains. The coconut trees (numbering at 310) along bringing her an income of Rs 6 lakh per annum through the sale of the fruits.

The villagers who once told her it was a bad idea would now be eating their words, she remarks. However, it has not been all smooth sailing to develop the land and make it profitable. She first had to equip herself with information on growing and nurturing trees. She talks about how she went through every book on trees she could find in her school library. When the district witnessed unprecedented drought a couple of years ago, the wells in her land too dried up.

She had to spend nearly Rs 1 lakh to bring in water to keep the trees alive. Later, she pooled in nearly Rs 4 lakh to construct a well and install pipes for drip irrigation, in an effort to combat future hard times. Now a member of the NGO Vanathukul Tirupur, she works towards increasing the green cover in the district. Thayammal ardently believes that trees have the power to curse the one who chops them down. So when she offers relocation as an alternative solution, you know she is not just looking out for the welfare of her green friends."

Educationists were divided over the results. Some disbelieving experts said it was not possible that just one per cent students carried overweight bags. Others attributed the change in textbook sizes and planning for the reduced weight of the school bags.

The state government had issued a notification for lighter school bags on November 5, 2015. The principal and another representative would be responsible if any child was found with an overweight bag.

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

The Delhi government's Directorate of Education on Thursday issued an order withdrawing the recognition of a private school in Dwarka locality for allegedly violating land allotment terms by increasing its fee without prior approval, The Indian Express reported. The order will come into effect from April 1, 2019.

The department said it had ordered Mount Carmel School in Dwarka's Sector 22 to stop fresh admissions for the academic session 2019-'20. The school is a Christian minority institution run by the Mount Carmel School Society.

According to the order, private unaided recognised schools in Delhi operating on land allotted by government agencies cannot increase fee without prior approval of the director of education. After a Delhi High Court verdict, the directorate had sought online proposals for the year 2016-'17 from schools that wanted to increase fee.

Mount Carmel School was issued a showcause notice in February 2016, citing non-compliance, after the school hiked fee by 25% without seeking the director's approval. However, the school contended that the directorate order was not applicable to minority schools and that Mount Carmel was being run on land allotted to it at institutional rates, minus any concession.

School principal Michael Williams said they would approach the court and seek legal relief. ""In 1998, the school land of Rs 1.5 crore was acquired for Rs 1.6 crore, which was not a concessional rate,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate, as under the Delhi School Education Act and Rules, 1973, the DoE [Directorate of Education] cannot cancel recognition of minority schools.""

Williams told PTI: ""Though we have not received the notice yet we have got to know about it from media reports. We urge the students and parents to not panic and assure that we would come out clean.""

The government has also issued notices to three other schools and directed them to refund to parents the extra fee they charged between 2006 and 2011, along with 9% interest, The Times of India reported. These include Bal Bharati School in Dwarka, St Marks Senior Secondary School in Meera Bagh, and Springdales, Dhaula Kuan."

Even its first year of training, as many as 120 of its 147 students participated in the divisional meet concluded in the city; 91 of them managed to bag medals too. The school offers training in various disciplines like fencing, judo and taekwondo.

At a time when most government schools in the city and rural areas alike concentrated on conventional games like kabaddi, volleyball and football, this schools took the initiative to introduce martial arts with the help of its physical education teachers P Sivaprakasham and N Nisar. This training was then extended to the school's girl students in the form of self-defence lessons. Teachers wanted them equipped to handle any situation they might face.

sport. Though their mothers were hesitant to allow them to be trained in martial arts, all parents are now happy that their girls have managed to achieve so much. Now, they eagerly inquire about fencing practice before asking about academics, narrates Swetha.

Headmistress N Shanthi cannot appreciate the effort more. The teacher's job is not just to improve the students' skills in academics; they should also identify their talents and put them on the path of development. She also remarks that such training has increased attendance among students. A year ago, only 50 per cent of students were willing to attend classes; this has increased to 95 per cent, she claims.

While the school might have its reasons to introduce martial arts to its students, the motivations for single

announced self-defence lessons, she was more than happy to sign them up for it. True to spirit, the girls managed to bag a silver medal in karate and Praveena has a bronze in fencing to add to it. It was the mother's aspiration that pushed them to their best, Praveena declares.

The school allows students to excel in swimming too. Four boys -- T Akash, V Mahadevan, M Muthukathiravan, S Logeshwaran (all class VIII students) -- were identified after teachers saw them

swimming in the Kurichi lake, located adjacent to the school.

All these boys had not had formal training before. Akash learnt to swim in the Kuruchi lake, for Mahadevan it was a check dam near Madukkarai and Muthukathiravan and Logeshwaran had the good local old wells."

At least 40,000 vans are plying without valid permits in the capital, of which around 25,000 are engaged as school cabs, according to data available with the Delhi government's transport department. However, only 9,600 school vans are registered with the department.

Despite several crackdowns against these cabs and unverified drivers, private vehicles plying as school vans continue to flout the guidelines mandated under the School Cab Policy, 2007.

The guidelines say that vehicle owners should have a commercial school cab licence. They fix a cap on the number of children to be ferried, list out safety precautions and mandate adequate and comfortable seating space, plus adequate ventilation in the van. The guidelines also mandate that van drivers wear Public Service Vehicle (PSV) badges and that their antecedents are verified and approved by the regional transport authority (RTO).

According to the Delhi Police, the eco cab ferrying the children that met with an accident on Tuesday did not have a permit to carry school children.

In April, a school van met with accident in which a seven-year-old was killed. The Delhi government had then said it would introduce changes in the 2007 policy by the end of the year in order to make rules more stringent, but nothing has been done so far.

The new rules were meant to fix accountability of both transporters as well as the school authorities for the safety of children while being ferried to and from schools.

Tuesday's incident has alarmed parents across the city. ""There are no school transport facilities available in interior localities, and we have to opt for private vehicles. The government should make it mandatory for all schools to provide vehicles in each and every locality,"" Nupur Sharma, a parent from east Delhi's Trilokpuri, said.

Officials of several schools, however, said that parents themselves preferred private vehicles over school buses because of the ""low cost"" and ""doorstep pick up and drop"".

""We keep requesting parents to not put the lives of their children at stake by hiring private vehicles,"" Jyoti Arora, principal at Mount Abu School, said.

Meanwhile, Delhi traffic police prosecuted drivers and owners of 6,532 school vans for various offences between January and November 15 this year. In 2017, 2,183 owners and drivers of such vans were prosecuted.

However, the city's school cab association said the city government had promised them a notification regarding the waiver of road tax and parking charges for school vans, which has not been released yet.

""Registering their vehicles as school vans costs drivers much more than plying them as private vehicles, as parking charges and road tax are higher. In a meeting last year, the transport minister had agreed to waive off these charges. But no notification in this regard has been released so far,"" Jai Singh Chaudhry, vice-president, Delhi School Cabs Association, said."

Parents say schools ask their children to bring extra books apart from routine timetable as they rush to complete portions. This adds to the load that students are carrying in their bags. The Union human resource development ministry has asked states to come up with norms of their own or follow the Maharashtra or Telangana models.

A parent from a Central school said, ""My daughter is in primary and she carries hardly four textbooks, but the size of those books is quite big. While they use worksheets, the weight of her bag is too much.""

The parent added, ""The school initially asked us not to give food from home in order to reduce the weight of school bag but her school canteen doesn't give healthy food. They have noodles and Chinese dishes that have left with upset tummy. So she carries tiffin which adds to the weight of her bag.""

According to a government order of 2017, the prescribed weight of school bags should be between 1,800 gm and 3,425 gm. Maharashtra's policy is that the weight of a bag should not exceed 10 per cent of a student's weight.

Jayant Jain of non-profit Forum for Fairness in Education said, ""The state education department has only formed a rule but it has not yet been implemented. The implementation will happen only when action is taken against schools that flout the norms. Students still carry heavy bags. The department doesn't have enough manpower to carry out inspections.""

Swati Patil, another parent and activist who has filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court on this issue, said, ""We have learnt that only schools in urban areas are aware of these norms.""

However, there are some parents who feel the introduction of lockers by school has helped their kids to some extent. Lockers allow children to keep books in schools.

A parent of a Class V student of a civic-run school said, ""Earlier, my children used to carry their textbooks to school from home. But now their school has brought cupboards to keep the textbook. This has brought great relief to us as even we too have experienced discomfort carrying heavy school bags while dropping our children to school in the morning."""

At a meeting of the deputy commissioners, chief executive officers (CEO) of zilla panchayat and the secretaries of all departments, Kumaraswamy was apprised by his ministerial colleague Sa Ra Mahesh over the poor quality of cycles being distributed to the 5.14 lakh students across the state.

Mahesh, at the meeting, told the CM that the cycles were so brittle that they became scrap within a few months of use. To this, Kumaraswamy sought an explanation from the education department principal secretary Shalini Rajneesh, who blamed the district officials of the department. He claimed that the companies provided samples of the best quality to them in Bengaluru, however, quality checks on the same were not taken up by the district level deputy directors for public instructions (DDPI), resulting in poor quality cycles being distributed to school children of class VIII to class X.

On hearing the explanation, CM Kumaraswamy directed the department to stop the supply of these poor quality cycles and halt all payments to the company supplying it.

Later, speaking to the media, Kumaraswamy said: ""There is a complaint over poor quality of cycles being supplied to the children, as a result of which I have directed the officials to hold a departmental inquiry into the matter.""

But according to sources in the meeting, there was also a debate over whether it was possible to cancel the scheme altogether considering the persistent problems with the cycle quality over the years and the burden on the state exchequer.

It is said that no sooner did Rajneesh appraise the CM of the reasons for the poor quality of cycles and Kumaraswamy directed the department to hold an inquiry, additional chief secretary (finance) I S N Prasad suggested that the government must consider the possibility of permanently shelving the scheme.

He said the scheme was serving no purpose to the students with poor quality and suppyl issues, with even the cycles procurement becoming more and more tedious and putting unnecessary burden on the state exchequer.

At present the state government is paying Rs 3,900 per cycle for girl students and Rs 3,600 per cycle for boys, with the total expenditure at Rs 185 crore.

""On hearing this suggestion, the CM directed Rajneesh to consider the possibility of even cancelling the scheme, if it is found unviable,"" said a official present at the meeting.

The scheme of supplying free cycles to students began in 2006-07, with former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa being the brainchild behind the scheme.

The scheme was primarily directed towards girl students who were traversing hilly regions and tough terrains without modes of transportation to their schools.

Soon after this, the government decided to extend the same scheme to boys. Both the schemes were extended to students studying between class VIII to class X.

Any move of cancelling the scheme may also create a political backlash as the scheme was launched by the current opposition party and was further extended by the Congress government over a period of 12 years."

Most students studying in government schools in India have never seen a plane, leave alone travelling in one. For 406 students of Government Senior Secondary School in Rajasthan's Indargarh village, too, it was a dream to sit in an airplane. A government engineer made this possible a few months ago by erecting a replica of a plane for a classroom in Alwar district. One class for all students is held in this special classroom inside the plane. The students feel so thrilled sitting in a plane that they don't want to go home even after school gets over.

""It has become a major attraction in the village,"" says principal Pushpa Meena. ""Even people from outside the village come here for posing in front of the plane. It has become a selfie point in the village,"" she adds.

Meena said recently after a wedding, the bride and groom came to the school for a photo shoot near the plane.

Until six months ago, the Indargarh government school, 16km from Alwar city, had a dilapidated building, broken classrooms, ceilings that leaked and an unattractive facade.

According to 2016 Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) survey of schooling and learning levels in rural India, Rajasthan is among the top three states with highest dropout rate in children of 11 to 14 years. Against the all-India average of 3.5%, Rajasthan has 5% dropout rate in this age group.

Unattractive schools are a major reason for high dropout rates.

The district unit of Sarv Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) took up the renovation of the Indargarh school six months ago. SSA junior engineer Rajesh Lawania prepared a proposal for developing facilities at the school and constructing an airplane for a classroom. He approached Sehgal Foundation, a non-profit organisation that has developed 30 government schools in the district, with the project.

In six months, the foundation has spent Rs 45 lakh on the development of the Indargarh school, said foundation official Mahipal Singh.

The classroom inside the plan is fitted with an internet-enabled LED screen where senior students get YouTube lessons and the juniors watch cartoons and hear stories, said the principal.

""The school is already drawing new students. This year, we have had 22 new admissions. The plane classroom has started only this week. We hope to reap its benefits in the next academic session,"" she added.

""Kabhi nahi socha tha ki hawai jahaz me baithkar padhenge, yeh kisi sapne se kam nahi hai (We never thought we will ever sit in a plane. This is nothing short of a dream),"" said Priyanka Saini of Class 11. Her friends, Kanchala and Anju, couldn't agree more.

The villagers are happy with the development and feel a sense of ownership. ""We will look after the school. It has changed our vision towards a school,"" said Jatan Singh, a local.

Former sarpanch Ramjilal Meena said the gram panchayat was fortunate to have a school like this.

The plane has two entries with stairs to climb. There's pathway from the classrooms to the stairs with trees on both sides. ""We planted 1,100 plants to improve the landscape and make the campus children friendly,"" Lawania said.

The SSA engineer had earlier got classrooms of a government school painted like the coaches of a train. ""I am constantly thinking of innovations to make the schools attractive to increase enrolment and to check dropouts,"" he said.

Lawania said he has also never been inside a plane. He looked at YouTube videos to see the insides before designing the classroom."

would have been the first state in the country to fix a standard bag weight for schoolchildren in 2016, but the plan did not materialise. With the Ministry of Human Resource Management (HRD) issuing a circular to all the state governments fixing school bag weight for each classes, the state government is in a fix. The problem is the state now has to revise the syllabus -- in fact reduce the contents considerably -- if it has to adhere to the new weight standards.

According to the HRD circular, it's 1.5 kg for Class I and II, 2-3kgs for Class III and V, 4 kg for Class VI and VII, 4.5 kg for Class VIII and IX and 5 kg for Class X. Experts and government officials say that while the plan for reducing the physical weight of the bag should be taken up, the question is how the content will be reduced. This means, the department of education (primary and secondary) will now have to take a robust plan to reduce the content in textbooks.

In 1993, the Yash Pal Committee identified the problem of heavy and recommended that textbooks be treated as school property. It wants schools to allot lockers for children in schools itself. It also mooted a separate timetable for homework and classwork so that kids don't take books home every day.

Bangalore Mirror, in July 2017 did a test run, which showed schoolchildren were carrying heavy load on their backs, with some cases some exceeding 11 kg.

International guidelines say children should not carry more than 10 per cent of their body weight on their shoulders. But BM's test run in 2017 showed that Class 8 student carried more than 5.6 kg.

In July 2015, the Ministry of Human Resource Development, Department of School Education and Literacy, sent out an order to the Karnataka Primary and Secondary Education department. The Centre had then suggested ways like keeping textbooks at school. Even the CBSE had issued a notification in April 2016, aimed at restricting the number of textbooks carried by students to school every day. But despite all this, nothing has changed on the ground.

VP Niranjanaradhya, who was part of a committee set up by the Department of State Educational Research and Training to suggest the right bag weight for students, said: ""We not only have to reduce the physical weight, but have to reduce academic burden as well. We cannot ask a Class 1 student to memorize and tell Mathematical Tables up to 100. We should stick to basics. There are so many things in our textbooks which are not necessary.""

A senior offical from Department of Education said, ""We have to reduce the content of textbooks now. Whatever is irrelevant needs to be cut down and for example, if a Class 3 student is carrying all textbooks which weigh 4 kg, then we should bring that weight down to just 3kgs. How to do that? By reducing the content and eventually the sizes of the book.""

Gopalakrishna, director of DSERT and Karnataka State Textbooks Society said, ""We already have research submissions and reports over the years. We are collating everything and preparing a draft. The draft is almost over and I will submit it to the commissioner and the department and the department will give its final calls and issue the circulars to the schools."""

The school now has enough infrastructure, like any private school, to attract parents. Earlier, when it did not have enough of them, former MLA of Erode East, V C Chandrakumar (2011-16), granted Rs 33.50 lakh from his MLA fund to construct a new, well-furnished three-classroom building in place of the old tiled building. The present MLA, K S Thennarasu granted Rs 10 lakh to lay a proper floor and dig a new borewell.

The RMSA office in the school was shifted to the CEO's Office and the building is now used to conduct classes. Using SSA and panchayat union funds, eight toilets and a noon-meal centre were constructed recently; a bicycle parking space was also created.

Erode West MLA K V Ramalingam, during a recent visit, agreed to help construct a compound wall with a good gate. With donations from the public, walls of all classrooms, both inside and outside, were painted with pictures of leaders, scientists, birds, animals, flowers, trees, alphabets, etc, to encourage children to learn about them. Also, panels with Tirukkurals written on them have been hung in the buildings.

English medium in govt schools will not harm Tamil

ERODE: ""ALL parents want to put their kids in English medium classes. I can't force them to enrol the children in Tamil medium. If I try to do that, they will go to other schools. And rules say admission

should not be refused to any child. Through parents' choice, all classes here are now English medium. There is no Tamil medium class,"" V S Muthuramsasmy, headmaster of the Government Primary School on Periyar Street in the city told Express.

""Having only English medium classes in the school is not wrong,"" said Muthuramsasmy, who is also district secretary of the Tamil Nadu Aarambapalli Aasiriyar Koottani. ""Parents are clamouring to see their children speak English. They send them to private schools, unmindful of the hefty fees, for it. If the government itself provides good English medium education, they will not spend so much money on private schools. In fact, only if this demand is met will the strength of government schools increase,"" he added.

Opening LKG and UKG sections in all government schools will not affect Tamil, he said. All students have to learn Tamil as the first language. Besides, many in Tamil medium students who score high marks in Plus Two find higher studies, all of which is in English medium, difficult. A student learning in English from the primary level will find higher education easier.

As all the teachers here are postgraduates, there is no difficulty in conducting classes in English. The English reading and writing skills the school's students are very good, said, teachers. Hearing some students - Saranya and Saravanan of the fourth standard and Dhanushka and Merlin of the fifth - read lessons from their English texts and explain the meaning in Tamil clearly, proved their claims. The books in English for other subjects were also easy.

In fact, the students find the Tamil textbooks harder. ""Spoken English classes are conducted using CDs. So the children learn the pronunciation easily,"" said Umamaheswari, a teacher. ""The school also arranges free classes for karate and music. The teachers are paid from the school fund. ID cards and diaries also are given free of cost to all students. As private schools collect Rs 20-40,000 for the same education at the primary level, many parents prefer this school.

It is the main reason that our strength is growing every year. Our aim is to make the school first in the State in all aspects in the coming years,"" she added. Attracted by the good high quality of education in this school, many parents pulled their children out of private schools and put them here. In fact, admissions in the nearby corporation, and even private, schools have come down because of this."

The Congress party in Kerala has come out strongly against the CPM-led Pinarayi Vijayan government and the RSS in connection with the Sabarimala temple issue. Criticising Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's stance on the Sabarimala temple women's entry issue, K Muraleedharan, senior Congress leader and chairman of the KPCC's campaign committee, stated that CPM has never spearheaded any renaissance movement in Kerala whereas the Congress was at the helm of all social reforms.

""No chief minister can hope that he can destroy a temple's rituals and customs. It is not a government office where the government can intervene....it seems like he (Pinarayi Vijayan) wants to be spoken of in the same way as Chattambi Swami, Ayyankali and Sree Narayana Gurukkal but by his actions on Sabarimala so far, he has earned the right to be placed with Ravana, Duryodhana and Dusshasana, "" K Muraleedharan was quoted as saying by Manorama news.

K. Muraleedharan also said that Pinarayi Vijayan will have to pay a 'heavy price' if he continues to turn the temple into a battleground. Referring to recent attempts by women to enter the temple, Muraleedharan said they are individuals who led campaigns such as the 'Kiss of Love' in Kerala. Hitting out at RSS on the Sabarimala temple issue, K. Muraleedharan said that the RSS has no real faith.

While many private schools in the district have managed to complete 80% of the SSLC syllabus, students of government institutions are contending with prolonged truancy of their teachers. Consequently, a very significant amount of their syllabus has not been covered, leaving the students in a lurch.

The teachers have laid the blame squarely at the doors of the officials of the department of public instruction (DPI) for the protracted delay in finalising the transfer process. Sources in the Karnataka primary and secondary education department said that the process was initiated as early as December 2017, but stiff resistance from teachers unwilling to relocate to rural areas resulted in the delay.

An officer in the primary education department said, ""We will complete the transfer of primary school teachers by October 30, following which we will start the transfer process of high school teachers. As a result, many schools will not have teachers for various subjects till December, which might pose problems to SSLC students.""

That private schools were holding camps on how best to tackle SSLC examinations set the dire situation in state-run institutions in stark relief, he said. ""At government schools, students are more worried about, who their new teacher will be, whether he or she will complete the syllabus on time and if the teacher will continue where the previous one stopped, etc. In the absence of a full-time primary and secondary education minister, this is a fiasco. Students at government schools are likely to lose some marks owing to the delay in completion of syllabus,"" the official added.

President of the primary school teachers' association Basavaraj Gurikar attributed the delay in the transfer process to software glitches. ""We hope things change in the next few years and the process can be completed in a seamless manner, so as to avoid trouble for the students,"" said Gurikar.

Raghu Kumar, an SSLC student at a government high school in Mysuru city, said, ""The government must not let the students down. If a teacher is transferred in the middle of the academic year, it creates a lot of problems for the students. The government must ensure that such a situation does not arise next year.""

Deputy director of public instruction, Mysuru Mamata said that as many as 2,032 primary school teachers from across the district had sought transfer. ""The transfer of primary teachers was to be completed by October 22,"" said Mamata.

Former primary and secondary education minister and BSP leader N Mahesh told STOI that the delay was the result of a host of issues - the result of elections, confusion pertaining to additional teachers and technical glitches. ""It is unfortunate that students have to suffer. But, the department was also helpless in many cases,"" he added."

Basic reading and writing constitutes the child's ability to read simple sentences like: 'My name is Ramesh' or ""Gaay ghaas khay che"" (Gujarati for: A cow eats grass).

""They could not even do basic maths like answering 2+2=4; 3+7=10; 7-4=3,"" the official said.

This revelation on the shocking state of education was revealed in the seventh edition of the 'Gunotsav' drive, a study undertaken by the state government where primary school students are assessed to ascertain their levels of learning.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama admitted that the major learning gap was a cause of concern. He said that state was committed to turning the situation around.

""Gujarat is the only state that has assessed the problem. Once we knew the problem, we first initiated an out-of-box measure like Mission Vidya to remedy it. After this intervention, where earlier only five students in a class could read or write, now only 5 can't,"" said Chudasama.

Mission Vidya was launched recently by the Gujarat government, where teachers are asked to give 3 hours of extra classes to weak students for 35 days.

At the end of Mission Vidya, 43% of the weak students identified were able to read and write simple sentences and do basic maths.

Officials, however, admitted that the huge learning gap would need more than stop-gap interventions for quality to be improved.

On October 3, the Bombay High Court questioned the rationale of the state government behind permitting vehicles having a seating capacity of less than 13 to ply as a school bus, defying the central government's notification from last year that had defined ""school buses"" as vehicles that have a seating capacity of 13 passengers and more, excluding the driver. Earlier in August, the HC had summoned the additional commissioner of the Maharashtra transport department for issuing a resolution that nullified the order regulating school buses. The transport department had issued a circular on May 19 that allowed vehicles without 13 seats to ply as school buses.

While the alterations to school bus rules have irked the HC, they have raised many eyebrows. Doesn't the state government give two hoots about the safety of school children, ask concerned citizens.

While people want the government to take the issue seriously and school authorities to ensure complete compliance of vehicle safety norms, school managements grumble that even if they provide transport facilities, parents choose 'unsafe vehicles' for their kids.

When I compare today's scenario with my school days, I feel that quite a number of measures had taken by authorities to make school transport safe. But if we feel that the authorities are not doing enough, and our children are travelling via unsafe mode, we should immediately stop using them. Unsafe modes of school transport survive because of parents who just complain and not look for alternatives. -- Ankit Arora, Borivali

We need a policy that is holistic and takes care of all aspects. Having an attendant on the bus for the kid is a must. Not anyone and everyone should be allowed to drive a bus; they should be specially trained and have enough experience. Registration documents of the bus and details of its staff should be made available to parents. A background check of the bus staff before hiring is absolutely necessary. -- Yogita Gonji, Thane

The authorities and contractors who provide transportation facilities to school should ensure safe commute of children. However, I think that there's a dearth of rules and regulations which will make both school administration and bus operators more accountable, and I don't think the authorities are doing something about it. As of now no constructive step has been taken by the authorities to make commuting to school safe. -- Somesh Chowdhary, Andhwei West

The state government should come up with stringent rules guidelines for school bus since it is a question of our children's safety. It is also necessary that the existing rules and regulations are implemented strictly. Responsibility, however, does not lie with school authority and government alone. Parents should also play an important role in implementing the rules since it is for their children's safety. They should check that the school bus in which their children goes, is following all the rules and regulation set by the authorities. -- Smita Bhingarde, Jogeshwari

Safety is not defined by the seating capacity of the vehicle but on other factors like the experience of staff, adhering to traffic rules etc. The rule allowing 7-seater vehicles is the need of hour considering rising fuel cost. A 13-seater bus is financially viable only if all the seats are occupied. With only 5-6 students on a particular bus route, 13-seater bus becomes a liability. If the 7-seater vehicle is following safety norms, then I think it is always better to have a 7-seater option available. -- Neeta Lokhande, Navi Mumbai,

Ensuring safe school transport is one of the prime responsibilities of school authorities. There are many instances where loopholes in the transport system of the school had led to tragic unfortunate incidents. Just painting the buses and vans with yellow colour cannot be a justified solution. A background check of bus staff is a must. At times drivers work on a freelance basis without any authorized license which ultimately puts the future of small kids at stake. -- Bhavesh Sharma, Dahisar

Change has come, things are much better than what it was five years ago. However, I feel, much more can be done. Even with the rules in place, there is rampant over-crowding in the school vans and buses. Children need to have full seat to themselves to accommodate their schoolbags. Often two or more students are cramped in addition to the sanctioned capacity. Buses going over the speed limit and the fear of children getting injured inside the bus are a concern with many parents. -- Tejashri Bhingarde, Sewri

Buses that are run by the school management are functioning in accordance with the rules. They are spacious, have a supervisor and facilitate safe disembarkation and embarkation. The same cannot be said about the private vans. The driver alone can't supervise the kids. Even with grill doors, hard roof, fire extinguisher and other safety measures laid down by the state act, I feel that these vehicles are unsafe for children. -- Rashmi Sagvekar, Mulund

School authorities do not have any control over school transport unless it's owned by the school. Most of the schools across the city outsource bus service. Unless the police keep an eye on these buses on regular basis it will be difficult to expect full compliance of the safety norms on their part. In the majority of the mishaps, school authorities are held responsible to execute 100 per cent compliance of vehicle safety norms. Unfortunately, they do not have means to keep a check on these aberrations. -- Dr. Rajendra Pradhan, President, DS High School, Sion

Government is not doing enough to keep school transport safe. As per rules, autos carrying school kids should have grill doors. Most of the times the grill doors are missing in autos. I have complained about it to the police several times but in vein. What makes it worse is that they are not afraid of legal action. Our school management bears the expense of school bus driver and lady attendant, and our buses are as economical. Still parents choose unsafe vehicles for their kids. -- Raj Aloni, Principal, Ramsheth Thakur Public High School, Kharghar"

The Olympiad tests teachers across the country for their competence in three broad parameters, subject expertise, classroom practice & professional competency and logical ability & communication.

The schools were categorised into government schools, low-cost private schools (annual fee less than '1,500) and costly private schools (annual fee above 10,000). The results of the Olympiad showed that the teachers in all three categories of schools had no significant difference in any of the parameters, except when it comes to communication.

""Communication is measured in terms of language, structure, sensitivity and comprehension. This includes parameters such as sensitivity towards children with special needs, gender agnostic expression, ability to communicate with clarity when speaking to parents among others,"" said Anjali Jain, founder-director of CENTA.

Teachers from schools that charge fees of over '10,000 scored about 63 per cent in communication, while teachers from government schools scored 48 per cent. Teachers from low-fee (below '1,500) private schools scored only 45 per cent. ""Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are not deficient in any way in comparison with private school teachers. Private school teachers are better trained in coaching students for various exams when government school teachers are hard-bent on teaching the subject,"" defended G Arivoli, Joint Director of State Council of Educational Research.

Government school teachers in Tamil Nadu are largely on a par with national averages, said Anjali. For example, national averages in 2017 for classroom practice and professional competencies and logical ability and communication were 35 per cent, 38 per cent and 47 per cent respectively, while the same for Tamil Nadu government teachers were 32 per cent, 35 per cent and 41 per cent respectively.

""Around 15-20 per cent of participants in the Olympiad comes from various segments of Tamil Nadu. There are many winners among Tamil Nadu government school teachers across the years, in fact,"" she said."

No school in the state has been penalised or even pulled up for not complying with the recommendations made in the resolution. He presented to the court information obtained under the Right to Information Act, which indicated complete non-compliance.

As per recommendations in the government resolution issued in 2015, schools have been directed to take various steps like using tablets, one textbook for allied subjects, provide lockers to keep books in schools, etc. The resolution was issued after a government-appointed committee noted the school bags were so heavy that 60 per cent of students below the age of 10 were suffering from orthopaedic and stress-induced ailments.

The arguments were made during the hearing of a public interest litigation filed by activist Swati Patil claiming state government is not taking steps to reduce the weight of school bags. The petitioner relied on a report of WHO which claimed children suffered various orthopaedic and other ailments because of heavy school bags.

Nevshe said, ""The resolution places the onus of implementation on schools and parents, but the state has not clarified the action it would take if it is not implemented by the schools. Or who in the government will be held accountable to oversee this implementation, because of which there is non-compliance.

As part of the many educational reforms introduced in the last three-plus years, the Delhi government sent 200 teachers to Singapore for a teacher-training programme.

Mail Today talked to six such teachers, who were part of the current batch (September 2017-August 2018), and have brought back with them a slew of innovative ideas such as 'Flipped Classrooms', reintroducing lesson planning, developing support material, 'think stations', 'Go MAD (Make a Difference)' project and CAL (Computer Aided Learning) labs.

Deepti Chawla, Rajikiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, Yamuna Vihar; Kapila Parashar, Government Girls Senior Secondary School, Bhola Nath Nagar, Shahdara; Rashmi Grover, Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya, Anand Vihar; Gaurav Kumar, Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Dwarka Sector 1; Neeru Lohiya, Government Girls Senior Secondary School Sector 4, RK Puram, and Kadambiri Lohiya, teacher/co-ordinator at Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya in Gandhi Nagar were among those who witnessed the advanced teaching methods at educational institutions in Singapore, as well as visited the Museum of Education, which showcases the evolution of the education system.

FOR TEACHERS

In the past, only a handful of school principals used to go on self-sponsored trips to foreign countries to observe their teaching methodologies and imparted the knowledge gained to their schools on return.

Two hundred teachers of government school were recently sent to Singapore for exposure.

The Delhi government came up with the idea of sending teachers, coordinators to countries such as Singapore, Finland and the US. The teachers became 'students' and observed the teaching procedures at Woodgrove Secondary School in Singapore, attended sessions with school mentors and learnt about new avenues of teaching that focus on student development, rather than reinforce rote learning.

Dispelling the idea that they went on a 'holiday', the teachers stated that the programme, which involved only selected educators, intensely grilled them.

""For the five-day workshop, held under the The National Institute of Education (NIE), a Singapore-based institution, the teachers were asked to apply from 2016 onwards,"" said Deepti Chawla.

She further said, ""There were rounds of interviews to identify the teachers from close to 1,100 government schools. Out of the thousand teachers who had applied, only 200 were selected.""

Giving a further glimpse into the meticulous selection method, Rashmi Grover said they were asked to undertake a psychometric test, followed by a group discussion.

""An interview was held with senior officials from the Directorate of Education (DoE) of Delhi government, which evaluated the teachers on ideation, teaching experience and ability to learn from discussions.""

Neeru Lohiya said this was the first time that teachers were sent for such programmes, and not heads of schools. ""But then, no proper feedback was taken from these heads of institutions,"" she added.

SAYING NO TO ROTE LEARNING

The participants in this programme learnt the different concepts of effectual teaching adopted by school teachers in Singapore.

Lohiya told Mail Today how the five-day programme involved teachers interacting with mentor teachers across select schools, where they were demonstrated different educational aspects employed by state-run schools to encourage students to learn.

The aim of the initiative is to make classrooms more participative.

Kapila Parashar said that the idea of rote learning is discouraged in Singapore schools and students are asked to tell teachers the lessons they would want to be taken up for the day.

The main focus in these schools is to promote student participation, impart vocational knowledge as well as academic knowledge, while giving students the space to freely come up with ideas.

IMPLEMENTING IDEAS OBSERVED ABROAD

Right after the successful implementation of 'Happiness Curriculum' for all students studying up to Class VIII, government schools are now working out schemes for implementing the ideas these teachers observed in the foreign schools.

Talking about the changes, Gaurav Kumar said, ""Many technological facets have been implemented in schools on a pilot basis, such as the use of K-Yan projectors.""

BRINGING ALL STUDENTS ON THE SAME PLATFORM

This year, the Delhi government, in a bid to identify academically weak students, and bring them on a par with their peers, launched Mission Buniyaad. This idea was also taken from the mentorship trip, said the teachers.

The programme, which was implemented across all government schools in Delhi, witnessed a positive outcome.

""The recent educational trip was an eye opener. Teachers observed a number of activities which they are making students undertake here,"" concluded Deepti Chawla.

STUDENTS LEAD IN A 'FLIPPED CLASSROOM'

A flipped classroom is defined as a type of exercise where instead of the teacher leading the class, students take the lead and explain the day's topic to their peers through different activities.

Practised commonly across schools in Singapore, the idea involves a strategy where students are asked to read through topics and explain these to their classmates.

This innovative idea, says Neeru Lohiya, from the Government Girls Senior Secondary School, RK Puram, is being implemented in her school. ""We ask students to come prepared from home. After they are done explaining, the teacher explains the topic to the class once again. This exercise requires the participation of all students in a class.""

Further explaining the concept, Lohiya says, ""Students are divided into small groups and one or two topics are assigned to them. This reduces the pressure on them as they don't need to mug up stuff. Throughout such sessions, the teacher sits at the back of the class and observes the students.""

In 'flipped classrooms', students are asked to come prepared and take classes and explain topic to their friends.

In a typical classroom, the teacher is the central figure who explains the entire lesson and responds to questions. In a Flipped Classroom model, roles are reversed, as students take on the responsibility of answering questions.

Class discussions are centred round the students. The method also involves giving students the task of reading from a textbook or practising a concept by working on a problem set, for example, outside school through projects.

The main objective of a flipped classroom is to shift the attention from teacher to students where the students become the teacher and explain the lesson to their peers.

In a flipped classroom, lessons are taught via different mediums like plays or group discussions or videos. Class activities vary but may include - experiments, text analysis, debate or speech presentation, current event discussions, peer reviewing, project-based learning, and skill development or concept practice.

Through these activities, students get to spend more time on higher-order thinking skills such as problem solving.

This method also facilitates a more personal interaction between the teacher and students as well as active learning for the latter as they themselves get to participate in and evaluate their learning.
