State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

The development comes close on the heels of another such incident in Aligarh where farmers in the district herded stray cows inside government buildings to prevent crop damage.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath recently directed the officials concerned to make immediate arrangements for proper care of stray cows. He also ordered clearing of grazing grounds in different parts of the state from encroachments. In Agra, police had to intervene in at least six cases to free cows locked in schools and public health centres. On Saturday, villagers locked up stray cows in a school in Garhi Bachchi. A day earlier, cattle were locked up inside a primary school at Arela village in Etmadpur tehsil. Uttar Pradesh: Over 700 Stray Cows Locked in School, Health Centre in Aligarh.

Officials of the Basic Education department had to intervene to get the premises vacated for children who had been forced to stay away from classes.

A farmer from Bichpuri, Ram Bharosey, said a groups of villagers with sticks in hands have to keep moving around to ensure the cattle were kept away from fields. Several farmers also raised concern over what they called as 'population explosion' of cattle.

People do not know what to do with cattle which are usually chased away towards the urban clusters. The bulls in the city have caused several fatal accidents, they said. When contacted, the district authorities said plans for providing new pasture land and cow shelters will take time for implementation."

Bhadiya, who took charge as headmaster only a year ago, told how implementation of various programmes helped increase student enrolment from less than 200 to 222 this year. ""Innovative ideas such as no-bag day on Saturdays, concepts like emotional pillars, and teacher-student bonding, have worked well. They have boosted enrolment at this government school,"" said Bhadiya.

She was able to overcome a lot of issues with support from Piramal Foundation for Education Leadership (PFEL). The foundation has been offering leadership training programmes to school heads, youths and education administrators in the government system, while improving various education processes and deploying tools and technology.

""The idea of transforming schools through 'Headmaster Leadership' triggered during the Gujarat earthquake relief operations in Kutch,"" said Aditya Natraj, founder of PFEL. ""I noticed that while everyone was fleeing the affected area, one government school headmaster went back to help his students. Without waiting for support from the government, he mobilised the community and resumed classes under a tree. It was evident that a highly motivated headmaster, with good leadership skills, is what it takes to cause a significant impact on student learning."" Natraj noticed that there leadership courses for school headmasters were available only for some private schools, and not for government schools.

Maniram Mandiwal, who took over as principal of JP Janu Senior Secondary school at Jhunjhunu in 2015, found his institute had infrastructure to accommodate 2,000 students -- from Class I to Class XII -- but had only 385 students.

Following the mode of campaigns run by privately-managed educational institutions, government schools across the state have started a massive advertising campaign ahead of commencement of the new academic session on January 1, featuring achievements and facilities of the schools.

Sources in the education department said the state government's recent decision to provide annual administrative grants to schools on the basis of enrolled positions has added an impetus to this campaign.

Banners portraying facilities and accomplishments at entrances of schools has become a common sight. Some school authorities have also launched a social media campaign, named Utsav Vidyarambha, an annual enrolment drive conducted every year with the help of local community and students, to enhance enrolment in schools.

""From this year, the publicity campaign for Utsav Vidyarambha has been launched on a massive scale. The prime thrust is to change the prevailing notion of most guardians that the quality of education in the state-government schools are not at par with private schools. Let's spread the message that trained and qualified teachers are imparting education in government-run schools and the admissions as well as other facilities are totally free for the newly enrolled kids at the primary level,"" a senior official of the education department told TOI on Friday.

Checking the decrease in enrolment, something which was detected as a major worry in Gunotsav, is the primary agenda behind launching such a publicity campaign, he added.

As per the new guidelines, schools with enrolment of 60 or below will not get any financial support, schools having enrolment of 61 to 400 will get financial support of Rs 20,000, schools having enrolment of 401 to 600 will get financial support of Rs 25,000 and schools having enrolment of more than 600 will get financial support of Rs 35,000."

All 56 papers of 20 marks each, albeit a revision test, would serve as a mock exam just to give the students the feel of the Boards and also help students to understand areas they need to focus on. By December 31, all government schools under the DSE across the State will receive these papers.

""In the last exam most students failed in Math and Science so we have decided to focus on revisions. From January 2 for the next 3-4 days students will do revision and then appear for the practice test which has been prepared by a panel of experts,"" explained B Venkata Narassama, District Education Officer, Hyderabad.

In addition, the DSE has also organised a day-long orientation programme for Math and Science teachers on how to conduct revision, evaluation of answer sheets and helping students clear backlogs.

Focus on below average students

Like every year this year too the two hours of extra classes before and after school is being conducted.

The tweets come in the wake of a recent meeting of eminent Kannada writers and activists urging the state government to withdraw the decision and to teach English only as a language from primary classes.

The two schools, along with numerous other establishments like the handloom weaving centre, which bore the brunt of the floods, are on the path of fast revival -- thanks to the effective intervention of voluntary agencies and the local people.

While rebuilding by the government agencies in different parts of the state is only in the initial stages, the UP and LP schools which remained half submerged in the flood waters for over five days suffering huge damage to their facilities, have come back to life. In the forefront of the effort to revive them was the Deepalaya Trust in Delhi which lost no time in identifying the devastated schools and offering its help.

In a commendable operation coordinated by A J Philip, Deepalaya executive officer and eminent journalist; Dr George Mathew, Chairman, Institute of Social Sciences, New Delhi; and A J Abraham, social activist in Ernakulam, the rebuilding of the school started in right earnest in September itself and the work was completed within two months.

The so-called government red-tapes and delays were overcome with the strong support provided by the school authorities, including the AEO Latha, school headmaster V K Santhosh, panchayat president T G Anoop, Cartoonist Academy and the local people.

The Trust spent Rs 33 lakh in replacing the damaged computers, reconstructing the collapsed compound walls, removing the slush and debris from the compound and classrooms, laying tiles on the floors, painting the walls and re-equipping the library. Soon, other NGOs joined hands, including 'Human Values' and 'Rapid Response' of Pondicherry, which replaced the old furniture, desks and benches with modern ones.

A funding of Rs 10 crore will be issued by the state government every year to the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB) which will run these schools.

The Maharashtra government's education department formed MIEB earlier this year. The objective is to bring government schools at par with international standards.

These ZP schools will now be called Bharat Ratna Atal Bihari Vajpayee International Schools. The Maharashtra state's school education department has issued a Government Resolution (GR) in this regard. MIEB, which will develop these schools of international standards, will get funding of Rs 10 crore every year for next 10 years. After that the schools are expected to be self-sufficient.

Francis Joseph, Head, Development and Strategy at the MIEB, said, ""This plan of making government schools rise up to international standards was started with a great vision. What could have been a better name for these schools? It will give these schools the required branding.""

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

The government said schools would be required to adopt an ""LGBT+ inclusive"" curriculum, including tackling homophobia, biphobia and transphobia and promoting awareness of the history of LGBT+ movements.

""Scotland will become the first country in the world to have LGBTI inclusive education embedded in the curriculum,"" said a statement released on Thursday.

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Teachers suggest

Start cluster schools: provide transportation from village to schools

Improved training mechanism in terms of both quality and quantity

Post training, need for evaluation

Refreshers training programmes to keep teachers up to date

Teachers, however, said that the government should itself decide what measures can be taken for their safety. ""The government cannot deprive us from our right to live a dignified life. We are not here to be humiliated and assaulted by students and their parents,"" Singh said.

Saying how the attitude of her teacher and principal made here question who she was, on Tuesday north Delhi resident Nikita addressed the principals of government schools and told them of her years of trauma while a student. She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities.

There is already a shortage of PE teachers where, of the 10,000 sanctioned posts, only 6,000 are filled.

Musician Ricky Khej and film-maker Rishab Shetty performed at the campaign spearheaded by Nav Bharat Democratic Party.

The campaign focuses on saving government schools in Karnataka and draws inspiration from Shetty's Kannada movie, Sarkari Hi. Pra. Shale Kasaragod. ""We realize there are many government schools that are on the verge of shutting down because of lack of funds. But the truth is that funds provided are being eaten up by politicians as showcased in the film,"" said Shetty.

The campaign initially began with people giving a missed call but has now turned into a movement with over two lakh supporters urging the State government to implement a new ""State Education Policy.""

Karnataka has been witnessing a trend where the government is shutting down its schools, citing lack of students and teachers and rationalisation among other things.

""We do not want our schools to be shut down. The reason why we study in government schools is that it is cheaper and closer to our homs. If these schools shut down then we will not have any education,"" said Mamatha S, a student of St. Marks government schools.

Another 7th grade child studying in a government school at Cooke Town, Anish A, said that his family cannot afford sending him to a private school. ""I want to become a mechanical engineer. People think that if we study in government school there is no education. They don't understand that many leaders were students of govt schools,"" said Anish.

Students from private schools were in full strength to support their brethern from government schools. ""I think government schools are doing a great job by providing children education. According to Right to Education (RTE), every child has the right to be educated. The reason why these children are studying here is that they cannot afford private schools,"" said Surabhi Kaipy, a student from a private school. The government needs to restore all their schools, she added.

""There are many schools in our state that might soon be shut down due to various reasons, but this will affect the lives of many children who live in these villages,"" Rishab Shetty said and added, ""People who studied in government schools should start adopting their schools, this way there would be better management and better education"".

In a snapshot of Punjab's education crisis, villagers say the schools must not close, but will not send their children to study in them.

Ramneet Kaur, a Class 4 student who studies at Government Elementary School, Janetpur near Derabassi, is the only girl in her school. She is one of just five students in the school. The other four, including her elder brother, are studying in Class 5. All the five students belong to Janetpur village. The school has just one teacher. Rupinder Kaur joined two and a half years ago and teaches the Class 5 students as well as Ramneet.

""All students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for mid-day meals as well. I have to do my duty whether there is one student or a hundred,"" Rupinder says. From Kharar, Rupinder now lives in Janetpur, having taken a room on rent in the village.

In 2017, when the Punjab Education department embarked on a rationalisation policy and decided to merge primary schools with fewer than 20 students with schools that had more students and were located within 1 km radius, the fate of the Janetpur school was kept in abeyance despite its single digit number of students. The nearest bigger school is in Baroli village which is around two kilometers from Janetpur.

Perhaps because it has just five students, the infrastructure and facilities at the school are in a state of neglect. It is located at the entrance to Janetpur village. It has a basketball court constructed by the village panchayat where the young men of the village play in the evenings. That is the best-maintained part of the school.

The single-storeyed school building has four rooms -- one is classroom, one a library, one serves as a storeroom; and one is meant for the anganwadi, where there are no children at the moment. That is where the five students now have their lunch. There is also a kitchen, a small courtyard, a hand pump and a washroom that is not functioning properly.

The verandah is in dilapidated state, and there are weeds growing through the cracks that have appeared on the building. Last month, during the bout of heavy rain, the entire school was flooded.

""It took three days for us to enter the school as water had entered all the rooms. The entire ground was filled with water. The building was leaking from many places. The rooms had been stinking for many days and the students had to sit there,"" said a woman working in the school as a midday meal cook.

All the books, including editions of Pankhariyan, a monthly children's magazine published by the Punjab School Education Board, had got wet, and when CNL visited, the school staff had laid the books out to dry on a big table in the room. ""There are around 800 books in the library. Many books were damaged in the water. There is a problem as it is an old building and needs repair. Even after the rain was stopped, the rooms were stinking,"" said school teacher Rupinder Kaur.

CNL also learnt that the water from the handpump is not fit for drinking. The five children bring water from their homes. The taps from the washroom have been stolen, so no one can use it now. Rupinder said she had informed the department about the condition of the building asking for immediate repairs, in two reports to the education department.

""We have to submit DICE forms annually. In the letter, we mention the problems and the requirements of the building. I submitted the form twice but the school building has not been repaired even once,"" she said. The Rs 18,000 electricity bill of the school was paid by the village panchayat two months ago. It had been pending for around one year. The department says a merger of this school with another nearby is still not ruled out.

Meanwhile, the thought that she may be the only student in the school next year after the four others pass Class 5 and leave for high school is worrying little Ramneet. ""Since my brother is studying in the school so it is easy for me to come with him, but after completing his fifth class, my brother would go to higher class in other school. My parents would not send me alone in this school. I have to go where my brother would be studying,"" she told Chandigarh Newsline.

""There are four students in class five and one in class four. All the students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for the mid-day meal as well. The lesser number of students is a concern but I have to do my duty whether there is one student or hundred,"" Rupinder Kaur, the teacher of the school, said.

Janetpur village has a population of around 1,000 people, but most families are landowners and can afford to send their children to private schools. The parents of the children in Government Elementary School cannot afford private school education. They are daily wagers, and were unavailable on the day CNL visited the village. Dharam Singh, 61, a village resident, said that the elementary school was started after efforts by the village many years ago but over time, the number of students has come down dramatically because of the lure of private education.

""Our children used to study in this school, but now it has become a trend to send children to private schools,"" Dharam Singh said, adding that if the government decided to shut down the school, it would be a setback for the village. ""In future if anyone decides to send their children to a government school, there won't be one here if this is shut down. That will hit girl children the most, because parents do not like to send little girls to schools outside the village as it is not safe,"" he said.

Around two kilometers from Janetpur village, another elementary school is facing closure. This one is in Bakarpur Bir village. Until August, there was one teacher in the school but he was shifted to another school in Dappar village.

""There was no student this year, the teacher was coming to the school to mark attendance, and he used to sit without anything to do. What was he to do?"" said Davinder Singh, a village resident.

Davinder Singh said that there was no admission for this session in the school. He added that in 2016-2017 session there were students in the school but they all were from migrant workers' families. ""There used to be a brick kiln near our village. The parents of the students were working there. The brick kiln was closed in 2017, following which the families migrated to some other place and the students also went along with their families. There was no admission in the school for 2017-2018 educational session, so the school was lying empty,"" Davinder Singh said.

The school building consists of three rooms and is located on the main road at the entry of the village. But like the Janetpur school, it is in bad shape. The building has been locked up after the teacher was shifted to other school.

CNL contacted the teacher, but he declined to speak. Harjeet Singh, another resident of the village, said most of the families in the village -- it has a population of 1,800 -- were landowners, who could afford to send their children to private schools.

The villagers do not want the school to close down but they are also not ready to send their children to the government schools. ""Now there is a better quality education in the private schools. The government schools are not providing that kind of education. There are a lot of problems. The base of the students should be strong so parents usually go for private schools. There are teachers, not good infrastructure and other problems,"" said a woman resident of the village who wished not to be named. She is also a teacher in a private school.

She, however, added that the girl students whose parents cannot afford private schools would be the worst sufferers, if the village school was shut down. ""There are security reasons. The parents may not send their girl children to government schools outside the village,"" she added.

Residents of both villages will not send their children to government schools but baulk at the idea of a village without a school, and want the government to ""find a solution"". Dharam Singh in Janetpur said that the education department should send its officials to the village to convince the people and demonstrate to them that the education in government schools is no less than what private schools provide.

""Government schools provide affordable education and people are spending thousands of rupees monthly in fees at private schools. There is a mad race in the village between parents to see who can send their children to the most expensive school,"" he said.

Davinder Singh in Bakarpur Bir said until the education standards of government schools did not improve, parents would not send their children to these schools. His own children go to the nearby Mount Carmel school. The District Education Officer (Elementary), Gurpreet Kaur Dhaliwal, said that they regularly send reports of all the schools to the education department. She added that they could not close any school in haste so they have to wait and watch before closing any school.

""It is easy to close a school but it is always tough to reopen the schools. Suppose if some children from these villages want to take admission in these schools from next session, what would we do then? It is not easy to close the schools. We have appointed one teacher in Janetpur school for five students. The teacher from the other school in Bakarpur Bir was shifted as there was no student,"" Dhaliwal added.

When asked about the poor condition of the school buildings, Dhaliwal said that they made a list of the schools which need repair of the buildings and soon the funds shall be allocated for these schools. When asked about the delay in the merger of the schools having a lesser number of students, Dhaliwal said that it is a policy matter and their duty is to send the reports of the schools. She added that when the government shall order, they shall shift the students.

She also said that they have sent the report to their higher authorities for taking further action on these two schools. Now the department shall find a solution to this problem.

The appeal has challenged the Allahabad High Court's recent order refusing to initiate contempt proceedings against the state government for not complying with the earlier judgement that had directed that kids of government servants, local bodies' representatives, judicial officers, who receive perks and salary from the state exchequer, should study in schools run by the Uttar Pradesh Board.

The plea, filed by advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, said non-implementation of the high court's directions was affecting the interest of the children as the primary schools run by the Basic Education Board of Uttar Pradesh were the victims of ""mal-administration and rampant corruption"".

""The interest of the common man is suffering for non-implementation of the said judgment as the administration of these schools is being seriously affected and mal-administered due to lack of adequate attention being paid by the bureaucrats and political functionaries,"" the plea said.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

It also sought directions to the state government, as per the high court's orders, for making a provision of awarding punishment of depositing a number of fees equal to what they are paying for their children's education in private schools.

Taking note of the dismal conditions of the state-run schools, the high court had in 2015 passed a slew of directions to the state government.

The high court had also asked the chief secretary of the state to take appropriate action in the matter to ensure that government servants, semi-government servants, judicial officers send their child to primary schools run by the UP Basic Education Board."

Sanjay Goel, DoE director, cited ""lack of demand"" as the reason for the vacant posts. ""Wherever there is no teacher there is no demand for the subjects and when there is a demand, we make all possible arrangements to allot a teacher. We are trying to appoint one permanent teacher for both languages in all government schools,"" he said.

The commission members, however, said despite being taught in fewer schools, a large number of students are opting for these subjects. ""Last year, as many as 90,000 students between class VI and X opted for Urdu and 29,000 opted for Punjabi. This is when the languages are being taught only in the 30% of the government schools in Delhi. Lack of teachers also discourage students from opting for the subject,"" Ali said.

Under the National Education Policy (NPE), students in Hindi-speaking states have to learn a modern Indian language (22 languages under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution) as the third language -- apart from Hindi and English. In Delhi government schools, Sanskrit, Urdu and Punjabi are being offered as the third language."

The move, officials said, is to empower parents to support their children's education. According to the 2011 census, literacy rate among women in the state was recorded at 57.18% with one or both parents of children in government schools found to be uneducated. Not only this, the department has also asked teachers to take special classes for members of 'Maa Samooh' - a group of mothers who taste mid-day meals from time to time to check the quality of food.

""The percentage of women's literacy rate is even lower is some backward districts of the state. When parents are not educated, they are unable to inspire their children to go to schools and help the latter in their studies,"" said Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, UP education director.

Officials have asked all schools to make sure that each student from classes VI to VIII teaches at least one uneducated elder from her or his family after school hours. The initiative is being done with an aim to improve results of students, who are likely to learn in the process of educating their parents. The elders, in turn, can also help tutor kids at home.

""The students of junior high schools should also be asked to impart basic education to at least one illiterate person in their families within a period of three months,"" read Singh's order.

Yatika Pundir, assistant teacher, primary school (Kamalpur), said, ""The initiative will help parents motivate their children to study. Kids will also be proud to see their parents sign papers instead of using thumb impressions.""

Sources in the education department said a report about the number of students who have successfully taught their parents or any uneducated person will be sent to the state authorities once every three months."

Of the 192 government schools in Madikeri taluk, all except these seven schools started functioning on August 27. The attendance of students however has been poor, and teachers and officials say that it will be take time for the children to come out of the trauma.

""They told me that I couldn't pass...that I was bad at studies,"" he said.

Dev is a student with a learning disability, who pursued his schooling in a government school in the city. His teachers and school principal convinced him that he cannot clear public exams like other students in his class. After clearing class 10 exams, he now pursues higher secondary schooling at Vidya Sagar, a centre for special education, and wants to work in the IT sector after.

He is one among scores of students with disabilities, who have been let down by the State's school education system. Although 1.36 lakh students with disabilities were enrolled in government and aided schools in 2016-17, only around a tenth of them received either a kit box, escort, or transport or more than one of them, according to the policy note of School Education Department 2017-18. Only 293 students were given braille study material although 18 per cent of all persons with disabilities are identified to have visual impairment according to 2011 census.

The census also reveals that literacy rate among persons with disabilities is about 60 per cent, when the State has a rate of 80 per cent. However, literacy rate may not reflect reality in schools, as students with disabilities are forced to drop out, mostly around class 8, as they are promoted through classes without actual integration into main-stream education until then, pointed Sujatha Sriram, a special educator.

""Children, with only mild disabilities survive education in main-stream government schools after that. Other students are asked to either drop-out, change discipline of study or learn from home,"" she said, adding that sometimes, parents are even made to wait the whole day to assist their wards. This is a problem, if the child is from an economically backward family, as an earning member of the family is forced to stay back to assist the child.

When Express visited government and government-aided schools in the city, only select blocks in many schools, even had basic inclusive Infrastructure like ramps. Staff from these schools confirmed that most of these ramps were laid, when their schools were polling booths. Such schools were accessible, only from the gate to the rooms that were used as polling booths. This left toilets in many schools inaccessible. ""I've had to hold my bladder till the end of the day until my mother came. Even though the toilet was in the ground floor, it was too small and difficult to access by myself on my wheelchair. I can't always ask for help,"" said Ram Kumar*, another government school student with physical disability.

Rajiv Rajan, the executive director Ektha foundation, who did a study of polling stations during 2016 elections, said that the ramps built in schools were too steep to access independently. ""Narrow corridors, and sandy approach to the ramps create major barriers for access,"" he said, emphasising that very few schools had proper access to toilets.

Vasantham Federation, an NGO, found through a sampled survey in Thiruvallur district, found that only 25 per cent of government schools at least had ramps. A total of 75 sample schools were surveyed. ""Ramps and building western toilets were the only infrastructural change made even in the 25 per cent of schools. Children with intellectual disabilities were being persuaded to discontinue after class 5. Barely any teacher knew sign language or braille,"" said A Lingston, from the federation.

With very little inclusive measures in place, only students who can verbally communicate well and have average cognitive development can complete their education in mainstream government schools, said Kalpana Rao, the principal of Vidya Sagar. When students can't express themselves properly, or need extra attention, or have multiple disabilities, schools even cite bullying as an excuse to wash their hands off the responsibility, she claimed.

""When Dev joined us, he was psychologically broken down and his self esteem was really poor. It took us three months to make him feel normal again,"" said Kalpana adding that teachers from the school, took Dev to every play, talk show, concert and performance in the city in those three months, in order to expose him to the various career options he had. ""We didn't need grand investments to re-integrate him into education. We just had to believe in him and had to invest a little extra time in him than usual,"" she said, adding that there at least 20 students like him who joined Vidya Sagar after dropping out of government schools.

Kalpana suggested that plausible inclusion strategy should be implemented strongly by the government. ""By the end of it, he voluntarily said that he wanted continue his education,"" she said.

Every school should be accessible to students with disabilities by 2019, according to the orders of the Supreme Court, said Pradeep Yadav, the principal secretary to the School Education Department. However, he did not specify the steps the state would take to implement this."

Sanjay Goel, director at the DoE, told the daily that they have sent a communication to the department of personnel and training to clarify if the 'very good' benchmark is applied from 2016 or before that. He said that they followed the 7th Pay Commission guidelines as issued by the services department but further clarification is needed on the same.

As opposed to 3.23 lakh students who were admitted into class 1 in government schools last year, less than three lakh students were admitted this year. This is about a 10 per cent decline in admissions. The admissions will be open until September 30 and final data will be compiled after that.

Admissions will, however, not improve drastically during this time, as schools have already begun their academic year over three months ago, said a source from the School Education Department. ""The admissions have reduced not only in class one but also in class 6,"" the source said adding that there is a similar decrease in enrolment in government-aided schools as well.

According to data, there is about a nine per cent decline in admissions in class 1 of government-aided schools too. Students, who had joined private elementary schools and who cannot afford private middle school fees, usually join government schools, instead. The reduction in admissions in government schools reflects an increase in admissions in private schools, said an official from School Education Department, who did not want to be named.

According to the official, the Right to Education (RTE) Act, which facilitates admissions for disadvantaged students in private schools, is a major reason behind the decline. ""If there are large private schools with a strength of over thousand in an area, it attracts the admissions that government schools would have gotten without RTE. Now more private schools have come up in the area to compensate the reduction in available private seats and therefore, more RTE seats are generated,"" he said."

In the midst of talks of government schools with low admissions running the risk of being closed down, a group of youngsters, who are government school alumni, have started 'Makkala Mane' in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk of Tumakuru district.

They -- alumni of government schools in Kallenahalli -- came up with the plan after two government schools in neighbouring Ranganakere and Marathipalya villages in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk were closed two years ago due to poor enrolments.

They decided to establish 'Suvarna Vidya Chethana', an organisation to save government schools by improving their student strength and offering English education in the pre-school years. The organisation, with the help of gram panchayat members, and old students of government schools, parents and friends, raised funds and started Makkala Mane -- LKG and UKG -- in Huliyar, Hoysalakatte, Dabbagunte, Chikkanayakanahalli town in 2016-17 and at Kallenahalli in 2018-19.

""We have appointed a total of nine teachers who teach in English for LKG and UKG students in the five Makkala Mane in these places. Closing government schools amounts to depriving the poor of education,"" said Shivakumar K.G., vice president of Suvarna Vidya Chethana.

His daughter goes to the Makkala Mane at Kallenahalli.

A room of the government school is turned into a Makkala Mane, which has small chairs, charts of English and Kannada alphabets, charts of vegetables, flowers, numbers and fruits, where the children get free English education.

An annual fee of ₹3,500 per student is collected from parents who can afford to pay, but the fees is not compulsory. The amount is used to buy uniforms and books for students.

Devaraj, who owns a small mobile repair shop at Hoysalakatte, said, ""It is difficult for me to send my daughter to a private English medium school. So, I am sending her to Makkala Mane, as the text books given in private schools are given to students here too, and the children are taught in English.""

High demand for admissions

Unable to handle the number of applications for admission, this school has put up a ""no admissions"" board at the entrance.

The school has 46 teaching staff, 3 non-teaching staff, a library, science lab and playground apart from other facilities. ""Last three years, we secured 100 per cent pass in Class-X examinations,"" says the school headmaster Banda Venkat Reddy. While the school is 'almost perfect' the headmaster has urged the government to construct a kitchen where midday meals can be cooked.

Going to school is exciting for children enrolled in Mandal Parishad Primary School. For, classrooms of this school in the remote area of Veernapalli look like train compartments. As many of the children studying here have not travelled in train, this gives them a good reason to attend classes. The makeover has worked wonders!

Children are often seen standing at the classroom entrances, pretending to be boarding or alighting the train.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

The curriculum will be based on a four-fold framework -- inspire through stories and case studies of entrepreneurial journeys, educate through self-designed micro research, involve through local community, and facilitate by supporting in developing ideas into projects.

Sisodia said, ""Barring few exceptions, once the child completes elementary schooling and joins the secondary class, his entire orientation, which is largely shaped by the teachers and parents, is to secure good marks in exams, get admission in a good college and get a job with decent pay package after completing education. This is considered a trajectory of success and anyone who either secures less marks or fails to join college or fails to secure a job is deemed as unsuccessful.""

""If our schools and colleges continue to churn out batches of students who are going to join the queue with the mindset of job seekers we will soon be left with very small number of job givers,"" he added. The minister has directed the education secretary to set up a high powered working group having senior faculties from SCERT/DIET, principals and individuals having domain expertise."

A funding of Rs 10 crore will be issued by the state government every year to the Maharashtra International Education Board (MIEB) which will run these schools.

The Maharashtra government's education department formed MIEB earlier this year. The objective is to bring government schools at par with international standards.

The involvement of teachers in elections has derailed the course schedule and examination process.

The exam for Class VIII is conducted by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education (RBSE) which is already overburdened with class X and XII board exams and has expressed reluctance in taking up any additional responsibility.

Here are a few stories of faith and transformation.

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood. This has resulted in the enrolment ratio dropping drastically. We have decided to amend the RTE Act allowing parents to admit children in a private school only if there are no government schools in the vicinity.""

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

""Scotland will become the first country in the world to have LGBTI inclusive education embedded in the curriculum,"" said a statement released on Thursday.

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Teachers suggest

Start cluster schools: provide transportation from village to schools

Improved training mechanism in terms of both quality and quantity

Post training, need for evaluation

Refreshers training programmes to keep teachers up to date

Teachers, however, said that the government should itself decide what measures can be taken for their safety. ""The government cannot deprive us from our right to live a dignified life. We are not here to be humiliated and assaulted by students and their parents,"" Singh said.

Saying how the attitude of her teacher and principal made here question who she was, on Tuesday north Delhi resident Nikita addressed the principals of government schools and told them of her years of trauma while a student. She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities.

Musician Ricky Khej and film-maker Rishab Shetty performed at the campaign spearheaded by Nav Bharat Democratic Party.

The campaign focuses on saving government schools in Karnataka and draws inspiration from Shetty's Kannada movie, Sarkari Hi. Pra. Shale Kasaragod. ""We realize there are many government schools that are on the verge of shutting down because of lack of funds. But the truth is that funds provided are being eaten up by politicians as showcased in the film,"" said Shetty.

The campaign initially began with people giving a missed call but has now turned into a movement with over two lakh supporters urging the State government to implement a new ""State Education Policy.""

Karnataka has been witnessing a trend where the government is shutting down its schools, citing lack of students and teachers and rationalisation among other things.

""We do not want our schools to be shut down. The reason why we study in government schools is that it is cheaper and closer to our homs. If these schools shut down then we will not have any education,"" said Mamatha S, a student of St. Marks government schools.

Another 7th grade child studying in a government school at Cooke Town, Anish A, said that his family cannot afford sending him to a private school. ""I want to become a mechanical engineer. People think that if we study in government school there is no education. They don't understand that many leaders were students of govt schools,"" said Anish.

Students from private schools were in full strength to support their brethern from government schools. ""I think government schools are doing a great job by providing children education. According to Right to Education (RTE), every child has the right to be educated. The reason why these children are studying here is that they cannot afford private schools,"" said Surabhi Kaipy, a student from a private school. The government needs to restore all their schools, she added.

""There are many schools in our state that might soon be shut down due to various reasons, but this will affect the lives of many children who live in these villages,"" Rishab Shetty said and added, ""People who studied in government schools should start adopting their schools, this way there would be better management and better education"".

In a snapshot of Punjab's education crisis, villagers say the schools must not close, but will not send their children to study in them.

Ramneet Kaur, a Class 4 student who studies at Government Elementary School, Janetpur near Derabassi, is the only girl in her school. She is one of just five students in the school. The other four, including her elder brother, are studying in Class 5. All the five students belong to Janetpur village. The school has just one teacher. Rupinder Kaur joined two and a half years ago and teaches the Class 5 students as well as Ramneet.

""All students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for mid-day meals as well. I have to do my duty whether there is one student or a hundred,"" Rupinder says. From Kharar, Rupinder now lives in Janetpur, having taken a room on rent in the village.

In 2017, when the Punjab Education department embarked on a rationalisation policy and decided to merge primary schools with fewer than 20 students with schools that had more students and were located within 1 km radius, the fate of the Janetpur school was kept in abeyance despite its single digit number of students. The nearest bigger school is in Baroli village which is around two kilometers from Janetpur.

Perhaps because it has just five students, the infrastructure and facilities at the school are in a state of neglect. It is located at the entrance to Janetpur village. It has a basketball court constructed by the village panchayat where the young men of the village play in the evenings. That is the best-maintained part of the school.

The single-storeyed school building has four rooms -- one is classroom, one a library, one serves as a storeroom; and one is meant for the anganwadi, where there are no children at the moment. That is where the five students now have their lunch. There is also a kitchen, a small courtyard, a hand pump and a washroom that is not functioning properly.

The verandah is in dilapidated state, and there are weeds growing through the cracks that have appeared on the building. Last month, during the bout of heavy rain, the entire school was flooded.

""It took three days for us to enter the school as water had entered all the rooms. The entire ground was filled with water. The building was leaking from many places. The rooms had been stinking for many days and the students had to sit there,"" said a woman working in the school as a midday meal cook.

All the books, including editions of Pankhariyan, a monthly children's magazine published by the Punjab School Education Board, had got wet, and when CNL visited, the school staff had laid the books out to dry on a big table in the room. ""There are around 800 books in the library. Many books were damaged in the water. There is a problem as it is an old building and needs repair. Even after the rain was stopped, the rooms were stinking,"" said school teacher Rupinder Kaur.

CNL also learnt that the water from the handpump is not fit for drinking. The five children bring water from their homes. The taps from the washroom have been stolen, so no one can use it now. Rupinder said she had informed the department about the condition of the building asking for immediate repairs, in two reports to the education department.

""We have to submit DICE forms annually. In the letter, we mention the problems and the requirements of the building. I submitted the form twice but the school building has not been repaired even once,"" she said. The Rs 18,000 electricity bill of the school was paid by the village panchayat two months ago. It had been pending for around one year. The department says a merger of this school with another nearby is still not ruled out.

Meanwhile, the thought that she may be the only student in the school next year after the four others pass Class 5 and leave for high school is worrying little Ramneet. ""Since my brother is studying in the school so it is easy for me to come with him, but after completing his fifth class, my brother would go to higher class in other school. My parents would not send me alone in this school. I have to go where my brother would be studying,"" she told Chandigarh Newsline.

""There are four students in class five and one in class four. All the students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for the mid-day meal as well. The lesser number of students is a concern but I have to do my duty whether there is one student or hundred,"" Rupinder Kaur, the teacher of the school, said.

Janetpur village has a population of around 1,000 people, but most families are landowners and can afford to send their children to private schools. The parents of the children in Government Elementary School cannot afford private school education. They are daily wagers, and were unavailable on the day CNL visited the village. Dharam Singh, 61, a village resident, said that the elementary school was started after efforts by the village many years ago but over time, the number of students has come down dramatically because of the lure of private education.

""Our children used to study in this school, but now it has become a trend to send children to private schools,"" Dharam Singh said, adding that if the government decided to shut down the school, it would be a setback for the village. ""In future if anyone decides to send their children to a government school, there won't be one here if this is shut down. That will hit girl children the most, because parents do not like to send little girls to schools outside the village as it is not safe,"" he said.

Around two kilometers from Janetpur village, another elementary school is facing closure. This one is in Bakarpur Bir village. Until August, there was one teacher in the school but he was shifted to another school in Dappar village.

""There was no student this year, the teacher was coming to the school to mark attendance, and he used to sit without anything to do. What was he to do?"" said Davinder Singh, a village resident.

Davinder Singh said that there was no admission for this session in the school. He added that in 2016-2017 session there were students in the school but they all were from migrant workers' families. ""There used to be a brick kiln near our village. The parents of the students were working there. The brick kiln was closed in 2017, following which the families migrated to some other place and the students also went along with their families. There was no admission in the school for 2017-2018 educational session, so the school was lying empty,"" Davinder Singh said.

The school building consists of three rooms and is located on the main road at the entry of the village. But like the Janetpur school, it is in bad shape. The building has been locked up after the teacher was shifted to other school.

CNL contacted the teacher, but he declined to speak. Harjeet Singh, another resident of the village, said most of the families in the village -- it has a population of 1,800 -- were landowners, who could afford to send their children to private schools.

The villagers do not want the school to close down but they are also not ready to send their children to the government schools. ""Now there is a better quality education in the private schools. The government schools are not providing that kind of education. There are a lot of problems. The base of the students should be strong so parents usually go for private schools. There are teachers, not good infrastructure and other problems,"" said a woman resident of the village who wished not to be named. She is also a teacher in a private school.

She, however, added that the girl students whose parents cannot afford private schools would be the worst sufferers, if the village school was shut down. ""There are security reasons. The parents may not send their girl children to government schools outside the village,"" she added.

Residents of both villages will not send their children to government schools but baulk at the idea of a village without a school, and want the government to ""find a solution"". Dharam Singh in Janetpur said that the education department should send its officials to the village to convince the people and demonstrate to them that the education in government schools is no less than what private schools provide.

""Government schools provide affordable education and people are spending thousands of rupees monthly in fees at private schools. There is a mad race in the village between parents to see who can send their children to the most expensive school,"" he said.

Davinder Singh in Bakarpur Bir said until the education standards of government schools did not improve, parents would not send their children to these schools. His own children go to the nearby Mount Carmel school. The District Education Officer (Elementary), Gurpreet Kaur Dhaliwal, said that they regularly send reports of all the schools to the education department. She added that they could not close any school in haste so they have to wait and watch before closing any school.

""It is easy to close a school but it is always tough to reopen the schools. Suppose if some children from these villages want to take admission in these schools from next session, what would we do then? It is not easy to close the schools. We have appointed one teacher in Janetpur school for five students. The teacher from the other school in Bakarpur Bir was shifted as there was no student,"" Dhaliwal added.

When asked about the poor condition of the school buildings, Dhaliwal said that they made a list of the schools which need repair of the buildings and soon the funds shall be allocated for these schools. When asked about the delay in the merger of the schools having a lesser number of students, Dhaliwal said that it is a policy matter and their duty is to send the reports of the schools. She added that when the government shall order, they shall shift the students.

She also said that they have sent the report to their higher authorities for taking further action on these two schools. Now the department shall find a solution to this problem.

The appeal has challenged the Allahabad High Court's recent order refusing to initiate contempt proceedings against the state government for not complying with the earlier judgement that had directed that kids of government servants, local bodies' representatives, judicial officers, who receive perks and salary from the state exchequer, should study in schools run by the Uttar Pradesh Board.

The plea, filed by advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, said non-implementation of the high court's directions was affecting the interest of the children as the primary schools run by the Basic Education Board of Uttar Pradesh were the victims of ""mal-administration and rampant corruption"".

""The interest of the common man is suffering for non-implementation of the said judgment as the administration of these schools is being seriously affected and mal-administered due to lack of adequate attention being paid by the bureaucrats and political functionaries,"" the plea said.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

It also sought directions to the state government, as per the high court's orders, for making a provision of awarding punishment of depositing a number of fees equal to what they are paying for their children's education in private schools.

Taking note of the dismal conditions of the state-run schools, the high court had in 2015 passed a slew of directions to the state government.

The high court had also asked the chief secretary of the state to take appropriate action in the matter to ensure that government servants, semi-government servants, judicial officers send their child to primary schools run by the UP Basic Education Board."

As education starts with teacher and ends with teacher, their training can help in overcoming the challenge, he added.

During the session on 'Exponential change', the speakers focused on the challenges for education as technological developments build on each other as the needs of society and economies alter, as demand for new combinations of knowledge, skills.

It is not only about developing the skills but at the same time also finding ways to help people in use them.

According to DMC chairperson Zafarul Islam Khan, officials at several government schools, including Yamuna Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Shahdara, said Urdu and Punjabi languages are not being taught there.

""Some students told us that the heads of their schools asked them not to opt for Urdu or Punjabi as their third language because they are not scoring and it might affect their results. But the major reason is the lack of teachers for the disciplines,"" he said.

In response to a notice to a Sarai Kale Khan school, the DoE told the commission last week there was no teacher for the languages and promised to allot one.

The commission has compiled a report through the Right to Information (RTI) Act on the status of Urdu and Punjabi languages in Delhi government schools. Of the 1,100 government schools in Delhi, Urdu and Punjabi languages are being taught in 284 and 282 schools, respectively.

The report said that of 1,028 sanctioned posts of trained graduate teachers (TGT) in Urdu language, 883 posts are lying vacant. Similarly, 780 out of 1,023 sanctioned TGT posts in Punjabi language are yet to be filled. TGTs are eligible to teach up to class 10.

""The situation is still better for class XI and XII students. Only 5 and 8 vacancies are there for Punjabi and Urdu, respectively,"" said Manzar Ali, a member of the DMC's advisory committee who has compiled the report.

Sanjay Goel, DoE director, cited ""lack of demand"" as the reason for the vacant posts. ""Wherever there is no teacher there is no demand for the subjects and when there is a demand, we make all possible arrangements to allot a teacher. We are trying to appoint one permanent teacher for both languages in all government schools,"" he said.

The commission members, however, said despite being taught in fewer schools, a large number of students are opting for these subjects. ""Last year, as many as 90,000 students between class VI and X opted for Urdu and 29,000 opted for Punjabi. This is when the languages are being taught only in the 30% of the government schools in Delhi. Lack of teachers also discourage students from opting for the subject,"" Ali said.

Under the National Education Policy (NPE), students in Hindi-speaking states have to learn a modern Indian language (22 languages under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution) as the third language -- apart from Hindi and English. In Delhi government schools, Sanskrit, Urdu and Punjabi are being offered as the third language."

The move, officials said, is to empower parents to support their children's education. According to the 2011 census, literacy rate among women in the state was recorded at 57.18% with one or both parents of children in government schools found to be uneducated. Not only this, the department has also asked teachers to take special classes for members of 'Maa Samooh' - a group of mothers who taste mid-day meals from time to time to check the quality of food.

""The percentage of women's literacy rate is even lower is some backward districts of the state. When parents are not educated, they are unable to inspire their children to go to schools and help the latter in their studies,"" said Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, UP education director.

Officials have asked all schools to make sure that each student from classes VI to VIII teaches at least one uneducated elder from her or his family after school hours. The initiative is being done with an aim to improve results of students, who are likely to learn in the process of educating their parents. The elders, in turn, can also help tutor kids at home.

""The students of junior high schools should also be asked to impart basic education to at least one illiterate person in their families within a period of three months,"" read Singh's order.

Yatika Pundir, assistant teacher, primary school (Kamalpur), said, ""The initiative will help parents motivate their children to study. Kids will also be proud to see their parents sign papers instead of using thumb impressions.""

""They told me that I couldn't pass...that I was bad at studies,"" he said.

Dev is a student with a learning disability, who pursued his schooling in a government school in the city. His teachers and school principal convinced him that he cannot clear public exams like other students in his class. After clearing class 10 exams, he now pursues higher secondary schooling at Vidya Sagar, a centre for special education, and wants to work in the IT sector after.

He is one among scores of students with disabilities, who have been let down by the State's school education system. Although 1.36 lakh students with disabilities were enrolled in government and aided schools in 2016-17, only around a tenth of them received either a kit box, escort, or transport or more than one of them, according to the policy note of School Education Department 2017-18. Only 293 students were given braille study material although 18 per cent of all persons with disabilities are identified to have visual impairment according to 2011 census.

The census also reveals that literacy rate among persons with disabilities is about 60 per cent, when the State has a rate of 80 per cent. However, literacy rate may not reflect reality in schools, as students with disabilities are forced to drop out, mostly around class 8, as they are promoted through classes without actual integration into main-stream education until then, pointed Sujatha Sriram, a special educator.

""Children, with only mild disabilities survive education in main-stream government schools after that. Other students are asked to either drop-out, change discipline of study or learn from home,"" she said, adding that sometimes, parents are even made to wait the whole day to assist their wards. This is a problem, if the child is from an economically backward family, as an earning member of the family is forced to stay back to assist the child.

When Express visited government and government-aided schools in the city, only select blocks in many schools, even had basic inclusive Infrastructure like ramps. Staff from these schools confirmed that most of these ramps were laid, when their schools were polling booths. Such schools were accessible, only from the gate to the rooms that were used as polling booths. This left toilets in many schools inaccessible. ""I've had to hold my bladder till the end of the day until my mother came. Even though the toilet was in the ground floor, it was too small and difficult to access by myself on my wheelchair. I can't always ask for help,"" said Ram Kumar*, another government school student with physical disability.

Rajiv Rajan, the executive director Ektha foundation, who did a study of polling stations during 2016 elections, said that the ramps built in schools were too steep to access independently. ""Narrow corridors, and sandy approach to the ramps create major barriers for access,"" he said, emphasising that very few schools had proper access to toilets.

Vasantham Federation, an NGO, found through a sampled survey in Thiruvallur district, found that only 25 per cent of government schools at least had ramps. A total of 75 sample schools were surveyed. ""Ramps and building western toilets were the only infrastructural change made even in the 25 per cent of schools. Children with intellectual disabilities were being persuaded to discontinue after class 5. Barely any teacher knew sign language or braille,"" said A Lingston, from the federation.

With very little inclusive measures in place, only students who can verbally communicate well and have average cognitive development can complete their education in mainstream government schools, said Kalpana Rao, the principal of Vidya Sagar. When students can't express themselves properly, or need extra attention, or have multiple disabilities, schools even cite bullying as an excuse to wash their hands off the responsibility, she claimed.

""When Dev joined us, he was psychologically broken down and his self esteem was really poor. It took us three months to make him feel normal again,"" said Kalpana adding that teachers from the school, took Dev to every play, talk show, concert and performance in the city in those three months, in order to expose him to the various career options he had. ""We didn't need grand investments to re-integrate him into education. We just had to believe in him and had to invest a little extra time in him than usual,"" she said, adding that there at least 20 students like him who joined Vidya Sagar after dropping out of government schools.

Kalpana suggested that plausible inclusion strategy should be implemented strongly by the government. ""By the end of it, he voluntarily said that he wanted continue his education,"" she said.

Every school should be accessible to students with disabilities by 2019, according to the orders of the Supreme Court, said Pradeep Yadav, the principal secretary to the School Education Department. However, he did not specify the steps the state would take to implement this."

He said that they followed the 7th Pay Commission guidelines as issued by the services department but further clarification is needed on the same.

The CCTV project was given an in-principal approval. These cameras will be installed in all corners of the schools, outside washrooms, vacant rooms and other inaccessible areas.

In an official statement, the Delhi government stated that the directorate of education had set forward the proposal after a number of incidents of child abuse in NCR. ""The cabinet accorded its administrative approval and the expenditure sanction for the installation of CCTV cameras in government schools under the Directorate of Education (DoE).

The proposal was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last year, under which parents would be able to access live feeds of their child's classroom though a mobile app. However, this invited severe criticism from educationists, and some sections of teachers even as principals cheered it as an aid to survey schools better.

A core committee was formed in December last year, which was entrusted with the job of preparing a road map, time-bound plan and oversee the function of installation of CCTV cameras in government schools.

In another decision, the cabinet also changed the name of school management committees to Vidyalaya Kalyan Samitis.

This is about a 10 per cent decline in admissions. The admissions will be open until September 30 and final data will be compiled after that.

Admissions will, however, not improve drastically during this time, as schools have already begun their academic year over three months ago, said a source from the School Education Department.

According to data, there is about a nine per cent decline in admissions in class 1 of government-aided schools too. Students, who had joined private elementary schools and who cannot afford private middle school fees, usually join government schools, instead. The reduction in admissions in government schools reflects an increase in admissions in private schools, said an official from School Education Department, who did not want to be named.

According to the official, the Right to Education (RTE) Act, which facilitates admissions for disadvantaged students in private schools, is a major reason behind the decline. ""If there are large private schools with a strength of over thousand in an area, it attracts the admissions that government schools would have gotten without RTE.

In the midst of talks of government schools with low admissions running the risk of being closed down, a group of youngsters, who are government school alumni, have started 'Makkala Mane' in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk of Tumakuru district.

They -- alumni of government schools in Kallenahalli -- came up with the plan after two government schools in neighbouring Ranganakere and Marathipalya villages in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk were closed two years ago due to poor enrolments.

They decided to establish 'Suvarna Vidya Chethana', an organisation to save government schools by improving their student strength and offering English education in the pre-school years.

An annual fee of ₹3,500 per student is collected from parents who can afford to pay, but the fees is not compulsory. The amount is used to buy uniforms and books for students.

Devaraj, who owns a small mobile repair shop at Hoysalakatte, said, ""It is difficult for me to send my daughter to a private English medium school.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

The plea alleged that instead of granting them readmission in the same government school, the students were forced to take transfer certificate (TC) and opt for the National Institute of Open Schooling instead. It said that out of the 1,36,663 government school students who took the Class X exams this year, 94,160 passed and 42,503 failed. The students took a compartmental examination, but failed in that too.

Agarwal said he had sent a legal notice to the heads of the schools on August 20 with a copy sent to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, but readmission was not given to the students."

SORRY STATE OF SCHOOLS

Primary school in Davangere

The primary school at Chikka Arakere village in Jagaluru taluk of Davangere district was constructed five decades ago. Cracks have developed in walls and wooden beams are broken. There are chances of the roof and walls collapsing any time. Classes for 1st to 5th are conducted in one room. Many students have been pulled out by parents of late.

Municipal high school in Ballari

Education is being imparted in four medium of instructions in the building which served as a prison during British Raj. It was converted as an educational institution in 1935. Earlier, the student strength was 1,500-2,000. But due poor infrastructure, the strength has dipped to 589. Of 35 classrooms, 16 are not in use. A part of the roof has already collapsed. There are no doors and windows and students sit on the ground"

State governments have increased their budgets for school education in the past three years, but the allotment of funds has not been enough to attract permanent qualified teaching staff to government schools, finds a recent study conducted across six States.

The report, prepared jointly by Child Rights and You (CRY) and the Centre for Budget and Governance Accountability (CBGA), examines budgeting for school education in six States -- West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra -- during the 14th Finance Commission recommendation period, which started in April 2015.

The study finds that there has been an overall increase in revenue with the States following the 14th Finance Commission recommendations. This was a result of an increase in the share of the States in the divisible pool of Central taxes from 32% to 42%. At the same time, a reduction in the Union government's contribution to the States for Central schemes in social sectors forced the States to improve their tax revenue collection. The study analyses whether the availability of additional funds translated into prioritising of school education in these six States.

Between 2015-16 and 2017-18, there was a net decline in the share of school education budget in the total State Budget for three of the six States, according to the detailed demand for Grants and State Budget documents. Bihar saw a dip of 3.1%, Maharashtra a drop of 1% and West Bengal 0.9%. On the other hand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh saw an increase in the size of school education budget by 0.4%, 2.6% and 3.2%, respectively.

The report examines whether the increase in the size of school education budget was more than the rise in size of the total budget, indicating a higher priority for the sector. It concluded that between 2014-15 and 2017-18, Uttar Pradesh saw a 98.8% increase in budget for schools, whereas its total budget increased by 63.3%. West Bengal's budget for school education increased by 49.4% while its total budget increased by 48.2% and in Tamil Nadu, the former increased by 38.7% but the total budget increased by 38.5%, indicating that school education was a priority for these three States.

At the same time, all the six States showed an increase in the magnitude of per-child and per-student spending for education between 2014-15 and 2016-17.

Despite a varying level of commitment towards school education across the six States, all of them struggle with a shortage of teachers. The report cites data from the Union Ministry of Human Resource Development to show that as on March 2017, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have from 19% to 34% of total teacher positions at the elementary level vacant. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu were relatively better with 5.9% and 2.6% posts unfilled.

Data from the District Information System for Education show that at the upper primary level, there is a severe paucity of subject-specific teachers required under the Right to Education Act -- 77% upper primary schools in Maharashtra, 46% in Uttar Pradesh, 40% in West Bengal and 37% in Bihar do not have subject teachers.

More than one lakh schools in India are run with only one teacher and all the six States surveyed have shown the number of such schools on the rise. The shortage of teachers is more acute at the secondary level -- Bihar has 20,494 teaching posts vacant, Chhattisgarh 8,278 and Uttar Pradesh 12,008.

The figures don't entirely capture the severity of the shortfall as they do not reflect the shortage of subject teachers."

Castes of the students were found written before the names of the students in the attendance register of both the schools. In Vaishali school, they were even segregated in classrooms on the basis of their religion and caste.

Education department primary director Giriwar Dayal Singh suspended acting principal of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya Meena Kumari at Lalganj block in Vaishali district and Kamlesh Kumar Swalambi of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua at Kalyanpur block in East Champaran district after the district education officers of respective districts submitted a report in this connection.

In case of GA Uchha Madhyamik Vidyalaya, district education officer Sangita Sinha on her visit to the school found that the attendance register had caste of students mentioned before their names. The school also had separate sections for students belonging to separate castes. Acting principal Meera Kumari said, ""This practice was prevalent since 2014 and it was started by former principal Phool Chand Ansari as a tool to save time and quick implementation of government schemes catering to particular caste."" She added they had no intention of hurting the sentiments of anyone.

In case of Uchha Vidyalaya Tenua, no separate classroom was found. However, students had their castes mentioned before their names.

Calling the incident as unfortunate, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said, ""Such things cannot be tolerated. CM Nitish Kumar is working for the welfare of the common people and we do not believe in caste and religion"". He also ruled out a report that one student Anjali Kuamri of GA Uchha Vidayalaya, who took the matter to Vaishali DEO was deprived of the benefits. ""She will be honoured for her bold step,"" said Verma."

Primary school teacher makes NHAI shift toll plaza

he grit, tenacity and commitment T of a government primary school teacher forced National Highways Authority of India to change its acquisition plan on Ludhiana-Chandigarh national highway, which is still being built.

LIFE IN COLOUR: Students are encouraged to be well turned out here

For 11 years, Sanjeev Kumar, a teacher at Government Primary School, Ghulal village near Samrala in district Ludhiana, worked to construct a new school building with the help of philanthropists from the village.

In July, a team of NHAI officials told him to vacate the school in two months.

""The NHAI planned to build a toll plaza here. They needed to widen the road for this and the school building was in the way. Over the past decade, we spent around Rs 26 lakh to construct the new building. When I told village residents, they were shattered,"" says Sanjeev Kumar.

Kumar first approached the district education officer and sent a message to secretary, education Krishan Kumar.

""He called me immediately. I went with a few village residents who have been helping us. As we sat there, he sent a letter to the Ludhiana deputy commissioner, asking him to do everything possible to save the school,"" Sanjeev recalls.

Ludhiana DC Pardeep Aggarwal sent SDM, Samrala and other officials to the school. The SDM called NHAI officials to the school. I heard the SDM telling NHAI officials that the school had to be saved at any cost and NHAI officials were asked to shift the toll plaza,"" he says.

Sanjeev pursued the issue till NHAI issued a fresh notification in October saying that the toll plaza would be shifted.

It is an incident secretary, education Krishan Kumar will not forget anytime soon. ""I could see his desperation and determination to save the school. Village residents were also committed to the cause. Such teachers deserve complete support. The Ludhiana deputy commissioner also took great interest in the endeavour and we are all happy with the result,"" he says.

Education dept steps in

It is remarkable that despite their tough circumstances, government school teachers are trying to bring about a qualitative change in their institutions.

""I learnt that a few teachers in the state improved their schools on their own, because of which more students got enrolled. In February, we called a meeting of such teachers. As they spoke about their experiences, we thought the idea was worth replicating across the state and called on principals and teachers to volunteer,"" says Krishan Kumar.

The officer pursued reforms in the education department during his previous stint as director general, school education for almost three years.

""By July, we had 425 schools with buildings turned into learning aids, improved infrastructure, amenities and sports facilities. The idea was to improve students' learning experience. We fixed the ambitious target of ""Mission 4,250"" by the beginning of the next academic session and asked these 425 teachers to motivate their friends and relatives in 10 other schools. Already, 1,700 schools have accomplished the task,"" he says.

According to the secretary, education, these teachers and communities are the biggest stakeholders in improving educational standards.

""Social accountability is much more result-oriented than departmental accountability,"" he said.

Incentives offered to teachers include transfer of choice, promotion and good ACR. ""All these benefits are non-monetary and the huge improvement in schools is without any extra burden on the state exchequer,"" Kumar adds.

Govt primary school, Jhans, Hoshiarpur

The school had just 17 students when Narinder Arora and his wife Manjit Kaur, both ETT teachers, joined in 2006. Now, there are 224 students. In an act that inspired trust, the couple got their daughter enrolled in the same school.

""There was nothing going for the small school but we decided to do everything possible to set things right. Apart from enrolling my daughter here, we motivated a few friends and fellow teachers to enroll their children as well. We assured them that their children's education or overall development would not suffer. Rather, we said they would see a marked improvement. My son is a UKG student here,"" said Narinder.

The teachers' dedication showed in exam results and students' performance in co-curricular activities.

""Soon, educated families also started sending their children to the school. We also had our own uniform,"" says Narinder Arora.

With this, village residents started pooling money for infrastructure upgrade. ""Philanthropists opened their hearts and pockets to us. Jalandharbased Satpal Singh Multani constructed two rooms. Jagjeet Singh

The Mathematics room in the school is its latest addition. The walls of the verandah have pictures of donors and those of well turned out students on a board with the title, Ajj De Sohne Bache (the smart children of today).

""We write names of five children on this board every day to inspire the children to remain clean,"" says teacher Ajmer Singh who started the transformation in 2007.

""When I joined the school, two snakes were found in the storeroom,"" he recalls. It is now an office.

Outer walls and walls inside the classrooms have paintings, poems and messages painted on them. ""We want to attract students. Coming to school should be a pleasant experience for them,"" he says. It has worked with the children. ""Tanvi, a Class II student sustained an injury on her Jeeta and his family in the village opened their house for us to accommodate 100 students as the school did not have enough space,"" Arora said, estimating that people spent around Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh on the school.

Two years back, they started kindergarten classes on the lines of private schools. ""Now, we get children in nursery and have around 125 kids in kindergarten,"" he says. In June, Arora was promoted as master in a secondary school.

""It was very difficult for me to leave the school and children. Residents literally pleaded with me to stay. When a village elder asked me to stay in a choked voice, I decided to decline the promotion. After this, village residents provided 56 marlas of land to the school and raised a boundary wall. Now, we have enough space,"" he says, adding that they need the education department to provide more teachers as the strength of students is increasing.

""NRIs and other villagers have helped to improve the school. Now, the entire village is involved. People from other villages also come to get their children enrolled here. We have transferred 56 marlas of land to the school. If the number increases, we will provide an acre-and-a-half more of Panchayat land to the school,"" says Jagjeet Singh.

finger last year. But she came to school the next day,"" Ajmer says. According to him, NRIs and philanthropists from outside the village pitched in and around Rs 22 lakh has been spent so far.

""Apart from improving the amenities, I have been focusing on the core issue - improving learning outcomes among students,"" he adds. The school has a sprawling park and playground. Students have mid-day meals on tables with granite tops.

Rurka Kalan (Jalandhar)

The village has two government primary schools - one for girls and one for boys. In ambience and facilities, these schools could give private schools a run for their money.

Walls of both government primary schools have been turned into learning aids for children. They also have libraries and reading rooms. The girls' school also has an LCD screen to screen educational programmes.

""When I joined on July 1, 2006, the school building was in bad shape, with doors and windows missing. There were around 80 students but not a single bench. The first thing to do was to get desks for students before winter. The Youth Football Club of Rurka Kalan, which is working to promote football in the area, helped us procure desks at a cost of Rs 50,000,"" says school teacher Sanjiv Kumar, the man behind the transformation.

This was just the beginning. Over the years, infrastructure, education and sports in the school were upgraded.

""Philanthropists spent Rs 19 lakh on the school. With the way things have come up, more donors are volunteering,"" he says.

At Government Primary School for Girls, Buta Ram, who was promoted as centre head teacher and shifted to the boys' school a few days back, brought about the transformation.

""My daughter studies in this school. After I joined here in 2013, we managed to mobilize resources and undertake works worth around Rs 22 lakh,"" he says.

The school has its own logo and calendar. Numbers and letters are painted on the walls and a park based on the theme of mathematics is being constructed. Sanjiv and I are competing with each other to improve our schools,"" smiles Buta Ram.

Both schools have well-furnished and neat kitchens to cook mid-day meals.

The boys' school is in stark contrast with the street. The backyard of the adjoining senior secondary school is also overrun with weeds like a dark reminder of how things used to be and what could happen if these efforts are not sustained.

SETTING AN EXAMPLE

Secretary education, Krishan Kumar gets pictures from the pathbreaking schools. Every day, he picks the picture of one school and forwards it on WhatsApp groups of the education department. This motivates the others and generates healthy competition. The schools are promoting extra-curricular activities and helping students speak English

TAKING THE LEAD

As school infrastructure is improved, teachers feel more motivated. They share ideas and help each other even while competing. Sometimes, we spend from our own pockets as bonding with schools and children has improved,"" says Ashok Basra, principal, Government Senior Secondary School, Jamsher Khaas near Jalandhar.

They aren't sure if the authorities would do all that is needed to enhance the quality of government schools and bring them on a par with private ones.

Notably, Section 3 of the Act, which is considered the core of the legislation, provides children the fundamental right to free and compulsory education in a neighbourhood school.

According to the proposal, if there's a government school in neighbourhood of a child -- within 1km for primary education and 3km for higher primary -- he/she should get admitted to that instead of a private school.

Nagasimha G Rao, state convener of the RTE task force, said, ""The government is citing the example of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, where government schools are in high demand. We're in touch with RTE activists there too. But the Karnataka scenario is different. Parents prefer English medium schools over government institutions.""

Mohammed Yousuf, a Marappa Garden resident and parent of a child who's an RTE beneficiary, said, ""I don't think government schools are up to the mark. They don't have good English teachers and lack infrastructure. Moreover, the nearest government school in our area is located on defence land, can be accessed by every passerby and has a dumpsite too. My son will not be safe.""

Education department officials admit that no new government school has been opened in the state in the past three years.

Citing a 2017 study by the RTE Forum, a national organization, which states that 90% of RTE students paid fees to private schools,Y Mariswamy, chairperson (in charge), Karnataka State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, ""We get a lot of complaints from parents. It is sad that students are still made to pay fees at private schools despite being admitted under RTE. As we are the monitoring body for RTE and as well as child protection laws, I feel this move will give a boost to government schools and put in place systems required in these institutions.""

Niranjan Aradhya, senior fellow and programme head, Universalisation of Equitable Quality Education Programme, Centre for Child and the Law, NLSIU, said: ""This is a chance for government schools to improve. The government just needs to do a few basic things like recruit more English teachers and upgrade schools to the level of Kendriya Vidyalayas. To make RTE effective, they need to implement section 12(2) of the RTE Act which mandates private unaided schools receiving government largesse to reserve seats for weaker sections from their neighbourhood without the state having the obligation to reimburse them. Delhi has been following this since 2004."""

Emulating models of neighbouring states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the state government plans to amend the Act allowing parents to enrol children in private schools only if there are no government schools in the vicinity. The Act defines vicinity as a radius of 1km.

Briefing mediapersons after the cabinet meeting, state minister for law Krishna Byregowda said: ""The primary intention of RTE is to provide education to all class of students. For students from BPL families it is free of cost. Till date, Karnataka had allowed parents to admit children in private schools despite having government schools in the same neighbourhood.

States like Kerala and Tamil Nadu already have such a law in place and it is said to have yielded positive results in terms of the number of students enroling in government schools.

The move to reduce admissions in private schools under RTE was first initiated in 2017 when then education minister Tanveer Sait had said the cost of educating children in private schools was a huge burden on the exchequer.

""In the past five years (2013-2017), the Karnataka government has spent over Rs 800 crore to educate children in private schools,"" Sait had said. ""It means we have lost so many students to private schools, who otherwise would have studied in our schools. We want to promote government schools."""

The survey found that 88% students were allegedly beaten up, as a matter of routine, multiple times a week in some government schools, while in other government schools, around 30% experienced corporal punishment multiple times. All 50 students from low-cost public schools, who were part of the survey, reported that they were beaten up.

On an average, almost half of the children interviewed were allegedly beaten by teachers multiple times a week. The report, Choking Childhood, is based on the findings of research undertaken by social organisation Agrasar, which works with disadvantaged communities.

A total of 521 children and 100 parents sampled randomly were surveyed, and an informal group interview with 12 teachers from two different government schools was undertaken.

There are around 130 primary government schools in Gurugram, from which the students were randomly selected. There are around 18,000 students in the primary schools, as per estimates.

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, 2009, prohibits 'physical punishment' & 'mental harassment' under Section 17(1) and makes it a punishable offence under Section 17(2).

""The report studies the impact of corporal punishment on the psyche of children who are doubly disadvantaged by virtue of them being children who are predominantly from poor migrant communities and first-generation learners,"" said Prerit Rana, co-founder and CEO of Agrasar. He added that corporal punishment in schools was not only a violation of human rights, but also impaired the health and education of the children.

According to the report, 70% of the children reported that they were beaten at home after parents learnt that they were beaten in school. More than 70% of the parents said that they beat their children, as they believe punishment is for their child's well being.

The report also outlined the challenging working conditions and lack of professional conduct among teachers in government schools fostered an environment that puts deprived children at risk of experiencing corporal punishment.

Responding to the findings of the report, Premlata Yadav, the district elementary education officer said, ""I will have to see the report to know how the survey was conducted. I do not agree with the findings of the report. One can expect 1-2% of such cases but it is incorrect to say that 80% of the children are beaten.""

Yadav added that teachers are not allowed to punish students and strict action is taken if such a complaint is raised. ""If we receive information of this nature, we warn the teachers and sometimes, it can also lead to their suspension. We take strict action on reports of corporal punishment,"" she said.

A Sanskrit teacher at a government school said that corporal punishment is rarely doled out. ""Teachers rarely beat students. However, sometimes children do not understand and teachers are compelled to take matters into their hands. I do not raise my hands at my students. I either ask them to do rounds of the ground with their hands raised up or call their parents,"" she said."

At a time when Government talks about ""Digital Literacy "" how is it possible that people especially students don't have access to electricity? Despite the obvious connection between electricity and educational achievement, however, the troubling scenes in Jammu and Kashmir are repeated as there are thousands of Government run schools without electricity. Present and past Governments in J&K, have been focusing on administrative affairs of education department or even pedagogy, but very little focus has been given to electricity in Government schools. The absence of focus on this issue is detrimental because, a study has put it like this, ""education is also widely recognized as one of the most essential components for poverty reduction"". Lack of electricity at primary, middle and secondary schools therefore creates considerable obstacles towards escaping poverty and correlates with many factors that contribute directly towards it. It is a big impediment towards digital literacy as well because when there is no electricity in a Government school, the children will have no access to computers and other digital equipment. The report on link between education and poverty assesses the direct link between electricity and education.

Based on the most recently available survey data from the World Bank and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the report first describes the current state of electrification of schools. According to the this data, roughly four out of every five primary and secondary schools in African countries (Govt and Private schools) surveyed lacked access to electricity, along with almost three quarters of village schools in India. This is much worst in Jammu & Kashmir state as more than 70 percent Government schools are un-electrified in this 21st century. When it comes to Kashmir division, more than 80 percent of Government schools are un electrified and these details I have been provided officially by several Chief Education Officer (CEOs) when I sought details under Right to Information Act (RTI). In Jammu province also the majority of Government schools in Rajouri , Poonch , Doda , Ramban , Reasi , Kishtwar and Doda are still un electrified.

Based on a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and policy literature concerning electricity and education, the report mentioned above assesses the educational benefits of electrification of primary and secondary schools, including lighting and access to information and communications technologies (ICT) as well improvement in staff retention and student completion and graduation rates. The final two main parts of the report, drawn from energy policy, development studies, and innovations in financing and public private partnerships literature, discuss the challenges facing school electrification, such as lack of financing and technical problems with equipment, along with the solutions and incentives with the potential to overcome them, such as Public Private Partnerships (PPPs).

Rajouri , Srinagar

At a time when Government of India is celebrating achievement of 100 percent electrification feat across country, information available reveals some astonishing facts. As per the Government figures, there are 1720 Govt schools in Rajouri district and out of them 1484 (over 86 percent) don't have access to electricity. Out of 1720 Government schools in Rajouri district , there are 995 primary, 557 middle, 117 high and 41 higher secondary schools. In addition to these there are 6 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalyas (KGBV) across the district.

In Srinagar district, more than 300 Government schools have not been provided electricity connection by Government till date. More than two years have passed since Government had ordered to get all the schools electrified. In Srinagar there are around 519 Govt run schools out of which there are 204 primary schools, 211 middle schools, 74 high schools and 30 higher secondary schools. Out of the 519 Govt schools, there are around 305 schools which are still un electrified.

Budgam, Ganderbal

In Budgam district there are more than 81 percent Government run schools which are un-electrified. This is an official information that was provided to me by Chief Education Officer (CEO) of Budgam under RTI Act. CEO Budgam informed me in his reply that there are around 1,036 schools in the district out of total 1278 that are ""without proper electricity connection"". Actually I had sought the details of all the un electrified Govt schools in Kashmir valley under RTI Act. I filed application before the designated Public Information Officer (PIO) in the Directorate of School Education Kashmir (DSEK). Instead of providing the information , PIO passed the buck to all the Chief Education Officers (CEOs) of Kashmir valley plus Leh and Kargil . That is why I got the details from each district. I also sought information about the number of girls' schools without a toilet facility and the number of schools without a proper electricity connection, boundary wall and drinking water facility. CEO Budgam in his reply said that ""all"" the girls' schools had a washroom facility, ""there are dysfunctional toilets "".

In Ganderbal district out of 587 government schools, 434 schools are un electrified which means around 83 percent Government schools have no access to electricity. These details were revealed by Chief Education Officer (CEO) Ganderbal in a reply to my Right to Information (RTI) application.

Conclusion

Why is Government compromising on providing the basic infrastructure to Government schools while as no such compromise is done when it comes to perks and salaries of Government employees especially Govt school teachers ? Infrastructure and level of education is coming down in Govt schools , but this is not the case with Government's own employees ? Their salaries continue to be hiked. Govt spends more than Rs 1.40 lakhs every month on an average Government school in J&K. Do poor kids enrolled in these schools get the desired facilities ? On contrary to this, not even Rs 50,000 is spent on an average private school in J&K by local school management, but the results are quite different. Board of School Education (BOSE) collected an amount of Rs 16.81 crores from students in shape of exam fees in Kashmir valley recently, but the class Xth & XIIth students were forced to write exams under candle light as there is no facility of gen-sets in the exam centers. Not even heaters are made available in Govt schools (exam centers) by BOSE and children are made to shiver in the cold. I have been forced to seek intervention of J&K State Human Rights Commission (SHRC) where I filed a petition recently.

I hope to get some good direction soon from SHRC. Imagine kind of trauma poor kids are facing in classrooms during June , July and August when temperature rises above 30 degree in valley and more than 40 in Jammu plains or in Rajouri , Ramban or Poonch districts ? After missing the initial deadline of May 2017, the Narendra Modi government on April 29th this year announced ""electrification"" of all inhabited villages in India has been completed.After having all the data available vis a vis un electrified schools in J&K , it clearly indicates that announcement by Government was largely symbolic. In a state where 75 to 80 percent Government schools are still un electrified how can Government claim to have achieved 100 percent electrification target ? How can Government claim to achieve digital literacy target in future if Govt schools are not electrified?

""My children go to a private school Madam, it is close to home, they learn English and mathematics"", says Selvi with a big smile on her face. Selvi, a Marathahalli-based domestic worker, like many others from low income households in Bangalore, finds private schools a better choice for her child.

Research has often pointed out that there is not much difference in the learning outcomes of children in government schools and in private schools. Yet in Bengaluru, like many urban centres in the country, children across income groups are flocking to private schools. While the number of private schools are rapidly rising, government schools are increasingly being merged/shut down in the name of low student enrolment. The narrative around government schools remains one of poor accountability and infrastructure, poorly trained or absent teachers, poor attendance and pass rates of students.

In 2016-17, Bangalore Urban had 1403 government schools, and almost thrice as many - 3426 - private schools. Student enrolments illustrate the trend better. That year, only 1.8 lakh children were enrolled in government schools, compared to nearly 11 lakh children in private schools.

The most commonly cited concern about government schools is the lack of sufficient, well-qualified teachers.

Dr V P Niranjan Aradhya, Programme Head (Right To Education) at the Centre for Child and Law, NLSIU, points out that there were over 28,000 vacancies for government elementary school teachers in Karnataka as of 2016-17. ""The number of sanctioned posts was 1.94 lakh, but only 1.66 lakh teachers were working then. The department has been talking about plans to recruit teachers, but currently poorly-paid guest teachers are being appointed in many vacancies,"" he says.

Given the low rate of enrolment in government schools in the city, there are schools with only 10-15 students spread across grade 1-5, or schools that have only 30 students overall from class 1-7. Such schools often have only one or two teachers. These teachers have to teach every subject to students across all grades, even if they are not qualified for it, says Aradhya. Teachers are also burdened with additional duties and administrative tasks. There are even schools in the city that lack a Headmaster, requiring one among the skeletal teaching staff to do the additional administrative tasks of the HM.

Anurag Behar, Vice Chancellor at Azim Premji University, says the low quality of schools comes down to the poor quality of teacher education. Behar was part of the implementation committee for the Justice J S Verma Commission report on teacher education. The Justice Verma Commission, set up by the Supreme Court, had pointed out in its 2012 report that the majority of Teacher Education Institutions (TEI) in the country were highly commercial private establishments.

Behar says: ""In the 1960s, India had only about 1300 TEIs. In the early 1990s, it was about 1500. Then, between 1993 and 2011, this number rose to about 16,000. In this period, the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) gave licenses to many private institutions that were fraudulent and corrupt; many of these institutions don't even hold classes."" He says that out of nearly 18,000 TEIs in the country now, about 92% are private.

Other issues pointed out by the Verma Commission Report include: teacher education curriculum remaining unchanged for over 65 years, TEIs being standalone institutions rather than being part of universities, the generalist nature of M.Ed programmes etc. The Commission had in fact reviewed 291 TEIs in Maharashtra, and recommended that 85% of these should be shut down.

Though much of the Commission's recommendations have been ignored, there have been a few initiatives such as the centre's budget announcement this year to introduce an integrated B.Ed course. ""But what about the existing 16,000-odd TEIs that are of low quality? Nothing much has been done about those,"" says Behar.

While shortage of qualified teachers is a major concern, both Aradhya and Behar say that teachers are not respected or incentivised enough in the education system. Teacher absenteeism - i.e., absence without a valid reason - has been blamed for much of the shortcomings of government schools.

But a 2016 study by Azim Premji Foundation (APF) across over 600 schools in six states including Karnataka, had shown that teacher absenteeism was only 2.5%. However, the overall teacher absence was around 19%, which was due to other administrative or departmental work they were assigned, trainings, or legitimate leaves; that is, teachers were absent due to systemic issues rather than a lack of professionalism.

The current system, wherein teachers' promotions are based entirely on tenure, hardly incentivises high-performing teachers as well.

Bengaluru's government schools are also affected by bureaucratic procedures like frequent teacher transfers. ""The transfer process is lengthy, and happens just a few months into the academic year. Events like elections can delay it even more. Neither the teacher nor the students would know if the teacher would remain in the school that year. This affects consistency in academic inputs,"" says Kapil Dawda, Bengaluru City Director for the non-profit Teach for India. Teach for India's fellows work as full-time teachers in low-income schools; currently they work with 24 government schools in the city.

Jean Boddu, Senior Program Manager at Mentor Together, another non-profit that works with government schools, says the distribution of bags and books to students also gets delayed by 2-3 months from the start of the academic year. ""Also, there is a huge dropout of students in 9th standard, as students who are academically weak are neglected, and fail exams."" Boddu says such students are not supported well enough as the school is worried that its 10th standard pass percentage may drop down if they continue there.

In terms of infrastructure, Bengaluru's government schools do have basic infrastructure like toilets and electricity, but in many cases the infrastructure is not functional. For example, schools that have toilets may lack water; or the toilet is kept locked. There is little investment in the operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure. In Bengaluru, corporates have adopted many government schools, providing funds, books, infrastructure etc.

Dawda says that schools located in areas like Whitefield which have a high concentration of corporates, tend to have better essential infrastructure because of this. ""Government schools in these areas often have a science lab, computer lab etc., which schools in areas like Ejipura or Goripalya don't have,"" he says. Since such philanthropic work is not streamlined and coordinated by the Department of Public Instruction, the results are often skewed and less effective.

In education system, the Cluster Resource Person (CRP) who oversees some 10-12 government schools per cluster, is the academic authority, says Aradhya. ""CRP has to monitor the quality of learning process, but he usually ends up doing administrative work and collecting data from schools. Parents also don't know that it's the CRP they have to approach, to hold their child's school accountable,"" he says.

The Karnataka School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Council (KSQAAC) routinely assesses government schools in the state and accredits them. Schools have to undergo both a self-assessment and external assessment, and are graded on multiple aspects like learning achievement, learning environment and physical environment. They are then given accreditation in grades ranging from A+ to D.

The Council has routinely ranked schools poorly. In 2014-15, for example, it had assessed 1220 government schools, 917 aided schools and 24 unaided schools in the state. In Bangalore Urban overall (Bangalore North and South educational districts combined), out of 78 schools, no schools got A or A+ grade, and only eight got B+. Sixteen schools got B grade, 33 got C+, 17 got C and four schools got D grade.

Aradhya opines that the accreditation system is useless as long as there is no initiative to improve the quality of schools. ""If the government is providing functional infrastructure, recruiting teachers and monitoring the learning process in schools, then it has the right to give accreditation. Else, continuing this exercise without doing anything to improve quality, only sends the message that government schools are bad,"" he says.

While government schools compulsorily have to submit to the KSQAAC accreditation process, private schools are not bound to. In the current system, private schools can participate in the accreditation process if they want to, by paying a fee to KSQAAC. Very few usually do.

Currently there isn't a system to assess private schools on their quality. The majority of private schools in Bangalore are low-income schools without adequate infrastructure or well-qualified teachers. However parents are keen to send their children to these schools because of the English language education offered, and the general perception that these schools are better.

Accountability remains the core difference between public schools and private ones, according to Shashi Kumar D, General Secretary of KAMS (Associated Management of Private Schools in Karnataka). ""There are issues with private schools, they are not isolated from the problems of running a school. For example there may be a lacuna with the lessons offered, or the hire of unskilled teachers. But because of the pervasive accountability in these establishments the teachers increase their skills, knowledge and teaching ability,"" Kumar says.

However, research has often showed that there isn't much of a difference in the quality of education in government and private schools. World Bank's World Development Report 2018 says that, in the 40 countries it researched on, including India, there were no differences in the learning outcomes of children in private and public schools, given that they had matching familial backgrounds. Any marginal difference was because private schools mainly admitted students from advantaged backgrounds. That is, student performance depended on the student's household, and not the quality of education offered by the school. Another study by APF in rural Andhra Pradesh in 2015 had shown similar results.

Behar says, ""There would be less than 2% private schools that are elite and actually have the resources to run a high quality school. But even their quality of education is suspect. The remaining low-fee private schools are mostly much worse in quality."" Behar says there would be only 10-15% private schools that are truly committed to providing good quality education. ""For the rest, it is a business,"" he says.

Dr Shalini Rajneesh, Principal Secretary (Primary and Secondary Education Department), says that government school students often lack a good support system. ""First-generation school goers cannot study the way a typical private school student studies - by rote. There are no support systems for public school students, no remedies and no help at home. That is why, now we are attempting to bring a more holistic form of learning; and we are doing this along with NGOs across the city, like Akshara.""

Whether government schools will in fact get the right support, or whether they will continue to be shut down further in the name of low enrolment, remains to be seen."

The government had introduced digital classrooms in high schools, infused of ICT as part of pedagogy, brought in subjects like robotics in residential schools, and most recently, made over government schools by turning their walls into canvases.

However, it seems their efforts don't prove much because the Unified District Information System for Education (UDISE), National Achievement Survey (NAS) by MHRD, and the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) have thoroughly highlighted the poor quality of government schools in Telangana, with respect to infrastructure as well as quality of education being imparted.

In fact, compared to the data published in the UDISE for the academic year 2014-15, this year's report revealed that not much has changed in government schools since TRS had come to power. One glaring example is that of computer availability in government schools, which has actually gone down to 36 percent from being 37.5 percent in 2014, as per the UDISE numbers. In secondary schools, it has increased slightly from 29 to 31 percent.

When it comes to matters of infrastructure in primary schools such as having boundary walls, single-room classrooms, playgrounds, and kitchen sheds, the data indicates stagnancy. While studies showed that there was a steady improvement in the performance of residential schools run by the social welfare department -- where just about 15 per cent of students studied -- other government schools like the zilla parishad schools were constantly ignored.

Another example is that of science laboratories in secondary schools. The percentage of schools having Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer and Maths labs have down to 17.6, 17.5, 16.9. 11.7 and 6.3 percent from 19.3, 19.2, 18.5, 12.7 and 8 percent respectively.

Poor quality of education

Various reports released in the last four years raised questions over the quality of education being imparted in government schools of Telangana. For example the NAS report released this year pointed out that performance of school students in Telangana in all the subjects was poorer than that of students from most districts of other southern states.

Even the Comptroller and Auditor General in its audit report released this year pulled up the Telangana government as it found that 14-26 percent children in primary schools and 21-47 percent children in upper primary schools scored less than 40 percent in the years 2014-17. It also pointed out issues like unhygienic conditions of kitchens in schools used for cooking midday meals.

TRS government can't walk the talk?

It's no news that the TRS government has never forgone an opportunity to talk about its achievements in residential educational institutions run by the social welfare department. Good performance of students in SSC exams, competitive exams, academic and extra-curricular initiatives has often been the talk of the town during TRS rule.

However, government teachers point out that these residential schools -- home to jus10 percent of the 22 lakh students enrolled in different government schools across the State -- are not run by the Department of School Education (DSE) and receive ample funds, as a result they deliver better results. The government is all-talk when it comes to these schools and mum when it comes schools that come under the DSE.

The stark difference could be seen in this year's SSC results as the pass percentage in residential schools was above 90 percent whereas in zilla parishad schools it was just about 75 percent.

Telangana State United Teachers Federation, general secretary, Chava Ravi, said, ""Around 20,000 teacher positions are vacant in government schools. The TRS government has not recruited a single teacher since 2014, even though the TRT was announced for 8,972 posts last year.""

""There are several schools where one to two teachers teach 5 classes and cover 18 subjects. Moreover, in this academic year, school maintenance funds have not been released yet by the State government and the amount is expected to go down with the merger of SSA (Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan) and RMSA (Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan).

Negative marks for TRS government on school fee regulation issue : Parents

Parents across the State have been crying hoarse demanding fee regulation. The Hyderabad Schools Parents Association (HSPA) has conducted many protests on this issue, including writing a post card to the Chief Minister and producing a song chiding him for not taking any action on the issue. The post even went viral on social media.

These protests and promises by the government -- especially the education minister -- notwithstanding, the TRS government has failed to address problems of exorbitant fee. The State government constituted a committee to look into the issue, headed by former Osmania University Vice Chancellor, Prof Tirupati Rao. The committee was formed in March 2017 and was supposed to submit its report in the next one month. It actually did so only in December. It's a year since the report was submitted, but it has not been made public yet. The government did not even form the district fee regulatory committees."

Just that morning a few of them had visited the Government Urdu Higher Primary School at Nachanahalli Palya on Manandavadi Road and soon after lunch, nearly ten of them led by Dame Hilary Blume (Director, The Green Hotel and Founder, Charities Advisory Trust in UK) were ready to hop into the mini bus and visit a few more schools run by the Government of Karnataka.

As the bus drove towards the congested Kyathamaranahalli and entered a small lane, the women, who alighted from the bus, were surprised to see a clean, well-maintained Government Higher Primary School. There was a welcome committee with the Head Master of the School V. Ramaswamy, a disciplined, dedicated teacher and H. Saraswathi, the Director of RLHP (Rural Literacy and Health Programme) who is coordinating with Charities Advisory Trust, greeting the group of lively women.

Walking up a flight of stairs that led to the library of the school at the far end, the students, both boys and girls, all dressed neatly in green uniforms got up shyly but most of them immediately recognised the familiar of face of Dame Hilary Blume, who is no stranger to Mysuru.

""Do you recognise Madam Hilary?"" asked the Head Master and most of the students immediately recalled her earlier visit to the school. The library is well- equipped with books, desks and benches (all funded by the Charities Advisory Trust) and the visitors were keen to see how many students were really into reading the books.

A few of the students got up to demonstrate how helpful the reading habits they had been inculcated with had worked. A girl from eighth standard picked up a book in English and read without any mistakes in clear diction while a few others read from books in Kannada related to freedom fighters and scientists. Then they sang a few patriotic songs.

Now, it was the turn of the motley group of exuberant women, mostly in their sixties and seventies, to become children. They started singing the nursery rhyme for kids, 'Head, Shoulder, Knees and Toes.' Led by 'Good Giver' Annie Taylor, who had taught little children in Ethiopia, they began on a slow pitch and accelerated. The children who joined them sang with gusto and joy.

Impressed by the kind of work done by the school and RLHP, Hilary Blume asked the Head Master, what else they required for their school. He said that they needed a water filter and a LCD screen projector. She promised to install both through the profits earned in The Green Hotel.

""The profit of every meal eaten in The Green Hotel helps buy an egg for a child or for the books of children,"" she told SOM.

The children then wanted to know more about the visitors and they introduced themselves. There were two Elizabeths, one from Canada and another from England, both of whom were doctors. There was Ann Kingston, who was the knitting teacher for the ""Knit for Peace"" group and Danielle Liebech, who had visited The Green Hotel five times and there was also the young L. Marie, originally from France, who is working with Hilary Blume.

After a satisfying visit at Kyathamaranahalli, the group moved towards Sathagalli, where there is a slum and another Government Higher Primary School. It was around 4.30 pm. The RLHP runs a nutrition programme here in the school premises. A few of the infants and children were sitting there along with their mothers. A young woman, fondly called Akhila aunty by the Sathagalli slum residents, had brought ragi porridge which had a healthy mix of pulses and greens like drumstick leaves.

Along with the porridge, the kids were also given boiled eggs. A few of the mothers told this reporter how useful this programme was, as it had helped their malnourished children gain weight and improve their health.

Then right next door was the Government Higher Primary School where in the evening free supplementary classes are run for the children. Children in the age group of six to 14 were sitting there quietly waiting for the classes to begin.

All of them in unison welcomed the idea of the evening classes and how they were all happy to be there studying.

RLHP Director Saraswathi asked one of the students to get up and welcome the visitors. A tenth standard student B.B. Mehak got up and welcomed the group. This girl, who is the Malala Yousafzai, (Nobel Laureate from Pakistan who is an activist for female education) of Mysuru, had stopped a child marriage in her area a couple of years ago.

One of the teachers, Seema, was a child labourer, who used to roll agarbathis. But today she has completed her Pre-University education because of the support of RLHP and Charities Advisory Trust.

The slum children here are so vibrant that when they were asked to sing a song, four girls got up and began singing Jalle Kabbu..., a folk song in faultless Kannada and dancing to choreographed steps. Asked for their names, they said Luhia, Simran, Husna and Rafia.

Everyone was moved by the effort that had gone into preparing the deprived sections of the society to face the world boldly.

""The Charities Advisory Trust is supporting many causes including the beauticians' course, nutrition programme, sponsoring health camps from the funds collected through Good Gift India. Their focus is also on libraries and they have helped setting it up in nearly 100 Government Higher Primary Schools,"" said Saraswathi.

Later, speaking to Star of Mysore, Hilary Blume said that 'Knit for Peace' is an initiative of the Charities Advisory Trust started as an income generation project for Hutu and Tutsi widows, victims of the Rwandan genocide and civil war.

""At our suggestion, the widows knitted school jumpers for the many orphans and we paid them by raising funds through featuring the project in Good Gift Catalogue, another of the Trust's initiative,"" said Hilary Blume.

""Good Gifts is an initiative started by me. This is a concept where the giver knows exactly where the money goes. Hence, we came out with Good Gifts Catalogue where people can identify with a range of causes; in fact, there are over 400 ways to help people take their first step out of poverty, enjoy better health and increased opportunities,"" she said and added, ""I ask the givers to come and see how the concept works. That is how I bring such people to visit Mysuru to see the schools and slums and how the money they have given is spent. Our next visit with the 'Knit for Peace' group is in early January,"" she said

Asked whether she believed like many others who are doing charity work that charity is also a business, Hilary Blume said, ""These are causes that I was introduced to, and continue to support, as I believe in them. I believe that once I give money, then the money is out of my hands to control. So it is important that I can trust those organisations I support. Administration is critical to keep a charity going, but too many big charities waste too much money.""

On whether she has written any books on charity having worked for more than 40 years in the field, she recalled five books titled, 'Fund Raising - A Comprehensive Handbook,' 'Accounting and Financial Management for Charities,' 'Charity Trading Handbook,' 'Museum Trading Handbook' and 'Charity Shop Handbook' she has written. Hilary Blume also revealed that she is penning the sixth one now called 'The Ethics of Charity Giving.'"

Scenes from two government schools in Delhi

The walls of the entryway of the school are covered with bright charts that talk about everything from sustainable development and 'Swachh Bharat' to 'happiness goals' and exam schedules. The cream-coloured floor gleams and the sun peeps out from the clouds behind the rows of students -- dupattas pinned, shirts tucked in, not a hair out of place -- sitting quietly for morning assembly. It's 8 a.m. on a hazy Delhi morning and this school in Dwarka Sector 10 is about to flip my perception of government schools completely.

""Government schools in India get a bad rap,"" says Principal T.P. Singh. ""But with RPVV, we try to do better."" The results are evident. The Dwarka branch of RPVV or Rajkiya Pratibha Vikas Vidyalaya, along with its counterparts in Lajpat Nagar and Rohini Sector 11, are the three schools from Delhi that have made it to the nationwide list of top 12 government schools that's been compiled by EducationWorld portal as part of its India School Rankings 2017-18. In fact, the Dwarka school tops the list, with the Lajpat Nagar and Rohini schools at No. 6 and No. 12, respectively.

Labs and libraries

The RPVV schools, a Delhi government initiative to provide quality education to marginalised sections, were first opened in 1997, with one each in Rohini, Paschim Vihar and Surajmal Vihar. Twenty-one years later, there are 22 schools, with five of them launched last year alone.

All of them boast of language labs, upgraded auditoriums, relatively well-stocked libraries and, most importantly, a teacher-student ratio of 1:35. They take in students from Classes VI to XII and admissions are through an entrance test. Students are eligible only if they have studied in a government school for a minimum of two years.

When RPVVs were started as schools for high performers, they had the same shortcomings as other government schools -- poor infrastructure, undefined learning outcomes, dated teaching methods. ""But the last four or five years have seen a lot of change,"" says geography teacher Neerja Lamba, who has been with the school since 2003. ""We have a stress-free learning and teaching environment now. There are cultural activities and exchange programmes; students want to come to school,"" she says. Singh points out that the Delhi government has given the schools a free hand for improvements. ""For example, for any expenditure below ₹50,000, I don't have to write to the government. Little things like this make it so much easier.""

Over the past four years, the Delhi government has steadily increased funding for education, from 20% budgetary allocation in 2015 to 23.5% in 2017 and 26% in 2018.

The schools' improved infrastructure is testament to that. In the Dwarka branch, there's a fully air-conditioned auditorium, a conference hall open to both teachers and students, and a spanking new running track that instantly catches the eye. The labs have the latest equipment; there's a 'project development' room where students are recycling paper; and there are working water purifiers on every floor.

Robot Gangnam Style

The change is nowhere more perceptible than in the Rohini Sector 11 school, halfway across the city, where I find Class X student Prashant Kumar elbow-deep in a half-built drone. He is working after school hours in what the school calls the 'Atal Tinkering Lab'. ""I'm pretty sure I can get it to fly in a day or two; I just need to stabilise the gyro sensor,"" Kumar says confidently. His supervisor Vivek smiles behind him. ""That's going to need another month or two,"" he says. Close by, Class XII student Pratham Chopra's robot is dancing to 'Gangnam Style'. The coding took four months, says Chopra.

In the corner there is an actual 3D printer, the table around it littered with prototypes of printed whistles. The design's final version is now being used by the school's PT teachers. Science teacher Sadaf Fathima shows us a keychain printed in the shape of her name. The lab is the school's pride and joy, set up as part of the Central government's Atal Innovation Mission. Nearly 10,000 schools across the country applied for the grant, and RPVV-Rohini was among those to bag it in the first round.

Food, water, lessons

The one-year-old lab has sparked an interest in science among students, helping also to bring more girls in, say teachers. There are only three girls in the Class XII science stream this year, but the trend is beginning to slowly change in the younger classes, they say.

Social sciences teacher Shivani Singh says such facilities help immensely to address one of the biggest

problems of government schools: dropouts. In the Dwarka school, 63% of students come from families with monthly incomes below ₹5,000; their parents are rickshaw-pullers, labourers, sweepers, tailors, mechanics, domestic help, etc. When these students come into Class VI, they are undernourished, unable to take home school work, and, in some cases, have to contribute to the household income by taking up odd jobs.

But even as the dropout rate in Delhi government schools has been increasing, from 2.9% in 2014-15 to 3.4% in 2016-17 (Praja.org study), with worse results in municipal corporation schools, the RPVVs don't have any dropouts. ""Children want to do more than just study from textbooks. The 'more' is what we provide,"" says Shivani. ""They get clean water and nutritious food like dal chawal, daliya porridge, poori-sabzi. Girls get sanitary napkins,"" she says.

Walking through the school's corridors, both at Dwarka and Rohini, there is a steady stream of 'good morning' greetings around us. The students, free for the day after a gruelling exam, are not reticent and engage with their teachers comfortably. ""That took a lot of hard work,"" says Principal Singh. It was not just academics but also student-teacher relationships that needed overhauling. From improving teachers' listening and communication skills to newer teaching methods and learning objectives, ""we needed a change in pedagogy,"" says Singh.

A new pedagogy

It was this need that led him to begin the Cluster Leadership Development Programme, running now in all schools under the Directorate of Education in Delhi. ""We select 10 or so principals, area-wise, and get them to work with a facilitator-trainer. The principals, in turn, go back to their schools and work with the teachers,"" he says.

This has reduced teacher-student conflict, Singh says. ""And communication skills among students have improved; it's not great, but it's much better than what it used to be.""

The clubs and extra-curricular activities also play a big role. RPVV Rohini, for instance, has a Legal Advocacy Club where lawyers and judges address the children once a month. The Bal Bhavan Kendra is an arts and crafts initiative sponsored by the government's National Bal Bhavan in addition to regular art classes. I find a classroom filled with Madhubani paintings, wall hangings, home decor items, and more.

We walk into a room full of Class X students, and when they hear of their school's ranking, they break into ear-to-ear grins. Asked about their ambitions, they list scientists, doctors and more, but among them a handful says 'teacher'. They are as excited to teach in this school as they are to learn. The teachers accompanying us couldn't have been prouder."

The decision to convert hundreds of primary schools into English medium schools in districts like Karimnagar, Warangal and Nizamabad by teachers and its success led to the government giving the official nod to other schools across the State to follow suit.

As expected the enrolment rate in government schools has shot up. But the education experts think that despite the change in medium of instruction, it has had little effect on learning outcomes of government school students.

In 2016-17, for instance, 4,872 schools in the State were given permission to convert to English medium. Earlier back in 2008, in the united Andhra Pradesh, for the first time the then government had granted permission to run high schools with parallel mediums - 5,500 in Andhra and 2,200 Telagana area.

A social audit of learning outcomes carried out on 1,302 students from Class V to X by Campaign for Learning Outcomes, released last week confirmed this belief. It revealed that while 650 students could neither read nor write English, 271 could read only small sentences but not entire paragraphs.

Problem of parallel medium

Apart from granting the approval for change of medium of instruction, teaching community alleges, that the government did little to ensure that the move actually benefits students. In fact, the decision to run two parallel mediums is part of the problem. With the teacher-student ratio dismal in government schools, forcing one teacher to handle not just several classes but to even teach in two different languages.

""Most teachers are from Telugu medium background so for the sake for convenience they end up teaching in Telugu. Also, they find it difficult to alternate between Telugu in one period and English in the next. Students are not able to get acquainted with the language"" said T Venkateshwar Rao, President, English Language Teachers Association.

Proper training needed

The problem is further compounded by insufficient training of the lack thereof. For instance, in 2016, select primary teachers were provided five-day English language training. This was supplemented a year later by another five-day training for the same set of teachers.

""Now only a couple of teachers are trained from each school and later they too were transferred. Last academic year in Warangal, teachers from 132 primary schools have been trained but soon they got transferred to Telugu medium schools. This beats the very purpose of having English medium schools,"" said Nagati Narayana, an educationist.

Since a number of teachers themselves took the initiative to start classes in English medium and when it started showing positive results, teachers feel the government became complacent.

Start cluster schools: provide transportation from village to schools

Improved training mechanism in terms of both quality and quantity

Post training, need for evaluation

""I could no longer endure the constant bullying of the schoolboys. The boys wanted to touch me and made lewd remarks about me because I behaved like a girl, but that is who I really am,"" said Nikita, the once schoolboy who now identifies as a transgender.

Saying how the attitude of her teacher and principal made here question who she was, on Tuesday north Delhi resident Nikita addressed the principals of government schools and told them of her years of trauma while a student. She was speaking at an event organised to sensitise government schools about people like Nikita under the Purple Board project, being implemented by the Society for Peoples' Awareness Care and Empowerment (SPACE) in collaboration with the Directorate of Education and supported by the embassy of the Netherlands.

The first phase of the project, targeted at the ones in a leadership position, will create awareness among principals and teach them about gender identities, including transgenders and homosexuals, and issues like Article 377. On Tuesday, the principals were encouraged to designate one toilet in their school as a unisex one, to frame anti-trans bullying rules and to organise multi-gender activities in their institutions.

Santosh Gupta, principal of a Seelampur school, admitted that for inclusive education, it was important to embrace the transgender community. ""I agree that education is the only way in which we can empower people from disadvantaged communities. Along with us, it is also important that the parents are included in this awareness programme,"" said Gupta.

In another phase, sensitisation events will be held for the nodal teachers of a school and then for the secondary students of the schools involved. Following this, a school that is determined to be ""trans friendly"" will be given an award.

Sanjay Goel, director, DOE, asked the principals to accept people from gender communities and work for their empowerment. ""They have their own way of living and they should be accepted as an important part of inclusive education,"" said Goel.

Meanwhile, lauding the government for accommodating of the rights of transgender, Anjaan Joshi of SPACE pointed out that people belonging to that community faced several hurdles. ""The first and the foremost of the problems is there is no separate column for the third gender in school forms. Also, it has been quite a challenge to advocate the issue of transgender rights and inclusion in public schools,"" said Joshi."

Musician Ricky Khej and film-maker Rishab Shetty performed at the campaign spearheaded by Nav Bharat Democratic Party.

The campaign focuses on saving government schools in Karnataka and draws inspiration from Shetty's Kannada movie, Sarkari Hi. Pra. Shale Kasaragod. ""We realize there are many government schools that are on the verge of shutting down because of lack of funds. But the truth is that funds provided are being eaten up by politicians as showcased in the film,"" said Shetty.

The campaign initially began with people giving a missed call but has now turned into a movement with over two lakh supporters urging the State government to implement a new ""State Education Policy.""

Karnataka has been witnessing a trend where the government is shutting down its schools, citing lack of students and teachers and rationalisation among other things.

""We do not want our schools to be shut down. The reason why we study in government schools is that it is cheaper and closer to our homs. If these schools shut down then we will not have any education,"" said Mamatha S, a student of St. Marks government schools.

Students from private schools were in full strength to support their brethern from government schools. ""I think government schools are doing a great job by providing children education. According to Right to Education (RTE), every child has the right to be educated.

In a snapshot of Punjab's education crisis, villagers say the schools must not close, but will not send their children to study in them.

Ramneet Kaur, a Class 4 student who studies at Government Elementary School, Janetpur near Derabassi, is the only girl in her school. She is one of just five students in the school. The other four, including her elder brother, are studying in Class 5. All the five students belong to Janetpur village. The school has just one teacher. Rupinder Kaur joined two and a half years ago and teaches the Class 5 students as well as Ramneet.

""All students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for mid-day meals as well. I have to do my duty whether there is one student or a hundred,"" Rupinder says. From Kharar, Rupinder now lives in Janetpur, having taken a room on rent in the village.

In 2017, when the Punjab Education department embarked on a rationalisation policy and decided to merge primary schools with fewer than 20 students with schools that had more students and were located within 1 km radius, the fate of the Janetpur school was kept in abeyance despite its single digit number of students. The nearest bigger school is in Baroli village which is around two kilometers from Janetpur.

Perhaps because it has just five students, the infrastructure and facilities at the school are in a state of neglect. It is located at the entrance to Janetpur village. It has a basketball court constructed by the village panchayat where the young men of the village play in the evenings. That is the best-maintained part of the school.

The single-storeyed school building has four rooms -- one is classroom, one a library, one serves as a storeroom; and one is meant for the anganwadi, where there are no children at the moment. That is where the five students now have their lunch. There is also a kitchen, a small courtyard, a hand pump and a washroom that is not functioning properly.

The verandah is in dilapidated state, and there are weeds growing through the cracks that have appeared on the building. Last month, during the bout of heavy rain, the entire school was flooded.

""It took three days for us to enter the school as water had entered all the rooms. The entire ground was filled with water. The building was leaking from many places. The rooms had been stinking for many days and the students had to sit there,"" said a woman working in the school as a midday meal cook.

All the books, including editions of Pankhariyan, a monthly children's magazine published by the Punjab School Education Board, had got wet, and when CNL visited, the school staff had laid the books out to dry on a big table in the room. ""There are around 800 books in the library. Many books were damaged in the water. There is a problem as it is an old building and needs repair. Even after the rain was stopped, the rooms were stinking,"" said school teacher Rupinder Kaur.

CNL also learnt that the water from the handpump is not fit for drinking. The five children bring water from their homes. The taps from the washroom have been stolen, so no one can use it now. Rupinder said she had informed the department about the condition of the building asking for immediate repairs, in two reports to the education department.

""We have to submit DICE forms annually. In the letter, we mention the problems and the requirements of the building. I submitted the form twice but the school building has not been repaired even once,"" she said. The Rs 18,000 electricity bill of the school was paid by the village panchayat two months ago. It had been pending for around one year. The department says a merger of this school with another nearby is still not ruled out.

Meanwhile, the thought that she may be the only student in the school next year after the four others pass Class 5 and leave for high school is worrying little Ramneet. ""Since my brother is studying in the school so it is easy for me to come with him, but after completing his fifth class, my brother would go to higher class in other school. My parents would not send me alone in this school. I have to go where my brother would be studying,"" she told Chandigarh Newsline.

""There are four students in class five and one in class four. All the students sit in the same classroom. We have arrangements for the mid-day meal as well. The lesser number of students is a concern but I have to do my duty whether there is one student or hundred,"" Rupinder Kaur, the teacher of the school, said.

Janetpur village has a population of around 1,000 people, but most families are landowners and can afford to send their children to private schools. The parents of the children in Government Elementary School cannot afford private school education. They are daily wagers, and were unavailable on the day CNL visited the village. Dharam Singh, 61, a village resident, said that the elementary school was started after efforts by the village many years ago but over time, the number of students has come down dramatically because of the lure of private education.

""Our children used to study in this school, but now it has become a trend to send children to private schools,"" Dharam Singh said, adding that if the government decided to shut down the school, it would be a setback for the village. ""In future if anyone decides to send their children to a government school, there won't be one here if this is shut down. That will hit girl children the most, because parents do not like to send little girls to schools outside the village as it is not safe,"" he said.

Around two kilometers from Janetpur village, another elementary school is facing closure. This one is in Bakarpur Bir village. Until August, there was one teacher in the school but he was shifted to another school in Dappar village.

""There was no student this year, the teacher was coming to the school to mark attendance, and he used to sit without anything to do. What was he to do?"" said Davinder Singh, a village resident.

Davinder Singh said that there was no admission for this session in the school. He added that in 2016-2017 session there were students in the school but they all were from migrant workers' families. ""There used to be a brick kiln near our village. The parents of the students were working there. The brick kiln was closed in 2017, following which the families migrated to some other place and the students also went along with their families. There was no admission in the school for 2017-2018 educational session, so the school was lying empty,"" Davinder Singh said.

The school building consists of three rooms and is located on the main road at the entry of the village. But like the Janetpur school, it is in bad shape. The building has been locked up after the teacher was shifted to other school.

CNL contacted the teacher, but he declined to speak. Harjeet Singh, another resident of the village, said most of the families in the village -- it has a population of 1,800 -- were landowners, who could afford to send their children to private schools.

The villagers do not want the school to close down but they are also not ready to send their children to the government schools. ""Now there is a better quality education in the private schools. The government schools are not providing that kind of education. There are a lot of problems. The base of the students should be strong so parents usually go for private schools. There are teachers, not good infrastructure and other problems,"" said a woman resident of the village who wished not to be named. She is also a teacher in a private school.

She, however, added that the girl students whose parents cannot afford private schools would be the worst sufferers, if the village school was shut down. ""There are security reasons. The parents may not send their girl children to government schools outside the village,"" she added.

Residents of both villages will not send their children to government schools but baulk at the idea of a village without a school, and want the government to ""find a solution"". Dharam Singh in Janetpur said that the education department should send its officials to the village to convince the people and demonstrate to them that the education in government schools is no less than what private schools provide.

""Government schools provide affordable education and people are spending thousands of rupees monthly in fees at private schools. There is a mad race in the village between parents to see who can send their children to the most expensive school,"" he said.

Davinder Singh in Bakarpur Bir said until the education standards of government schools did not improve, parents would not send their children to these schools. His own children go to the nearby Mount Carmel school. The District Education Officer (Elementary), Gurpreet Kaur Dhaliwal, said that they regularly send reports of all the schools to the education department. She added that they could not close any school in haste so they have to wait and watch before closing any school.

""It is easy to close a school but it is always tough to reopen the schools. Suppose if some children from these villages want to take admission in these schools from next session, what would we do then? It is not easy to close the schools. We have appointed one teacher in Janetpur school for five students. The teacher from the other school in Bakarpur Bir was shifted as there was no student,"" Dhaliwal added.

When asked about the poor condition of the school buildings, Dhaliwal said that they made a list of the schools which need repair of the buildings and soon the funds shall be allocated for these schools. When asked about the delay in the merger of the schools having a lesser number of students, Dhaliwal said that it is a policy matter and their duty is to send the reports of the schools. She added that when the government shall order, they shall shift the students.

She also said that they have sent the report to their higher authorities for taking further action on these two schools. Now the department shall find a solution to this problem.

The appeal has challenged the Allahabad High Court's recent order refusing to initiate contempt proceedings against the state government for not complying with the earlier judgement that had directed that kids of government servants, local bodies' representatives, judicial officers, who receive perks and salary from the state exchequer, should study in schools run by the Uttar Pradesh Board.

The plea, filed by advocate Shiv Kumar Tripathi, said non-implementation of the high court's directions was affecting the interest of the children as the primary schools run by the Basic Education Board of Uttar Pradesh were the victims of ""mal-administration and rampant corruption"".

""The interest of the common man is suffering for non-implementation of the said judgment as the administration of these schools is being seriously affected and mal-administered due to lack of adequate attention being paid by the bureaucrats and political functionaries,"" the plea said.

It further said that three years have elapsed since the high court's judgement, thereby causing serious loss of funds which should have accrued for development of these schools.

The plea claimed that the state government had also failed to submit the requisite compliance report despite the lapse of three years and there was no valid reason for it.

It also sought directions to the state government, as per the high court's orders, for making a provision of awarding punishment of depositing a number of fees equal to what they are paying for their children's education in private schools.

Taking note of the dismal conditions of the state-run schools, the high court had in 2015 passed a slew of directions to the state government.

The high court had also asked the chief secretary of the state to take appropriate action in the matter to ensure that government servants, semi-government servants, judicial officers send their child to primary schools run by the UP Basic Education Board."

According to DMC chairperson Zafarul Islam Khan, officials at several government schools, including Yamuna Vihar, Sarai Kale Khan and Shahdara, said Urdu and Punjabi languages are not being taught there.

""Some students told us that the heads of their schools asked them not to opt for Urdu or Punjabi as their third language because they are not scoring and it might affect their results. But the major reason is the lack of teachers for the disciplines,"" he said.

In response to a notice to a Sarai Kale Khan school, the DoE told the commission last week there was no teacher for the languages and promised to allot one.

The commission has compiled a report through the Right to Information (RTI) Act on the status of Urdu and Punjabi languages in Delhi government schools. Of the 1,100 government schools in Delhi, Urdu and Punjabi languages are being taught in 284 and 282 schools, respectively.

The report said that of 1,028 sanctioned posts of trained graduate teachers (TGT) in Urdu language, 883 posts are lying vacant. Similarly, 780 out of 1,023 sanctioned TGT posts in Punjabi language are yet to be filled. TGTs are eligible to teach up to class 10.

""The situation is still better for class XI and XII students. Only 5 and 8 vacancies are there for Punjabi and Urdu, respectively,"" said Manzar Ali, a member of the DMC's advisory committee who has compiled the report.

Sanjay Goel, DoE director, cited ""lack of demand"" as the reason for the vacant posts. ""Wherever there is no teacher there is no demand for the subjects and when there is a demand, we make all possible arrangements to allot a teacher. We are trying to appoint one permanent teacher for both languages in all government schools,"" he said.

The commission members, however, said despite being taught in fewer schools, a large number of students are opting for these subjects. ""Last year, as many as 90,000 students between class VI and X opted for Urdu and 29,000 opted for Punjabi. This is when the languages are being taught only in the 30% of the government schools in Delhi. Lack of teachers also discourage students from opting for the subject,"" Ali said.

Under the National Education Policy (NPE), students in Hindi-speaking states have to learn a modern Indian language (22 languages under the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution) as the third language -- apart from Hindi and English. In Delhi government schools, Sanskrit, Urdu and Punjabi are being offered as the third language."

The move, officials said, is to empower parents to support their children's education. According to the 2011 census, literacy rate among women in the state was recorded at 57.18% with one or both parents of children in government schools found to be uneducated. Not only this, the department has also asked teachers to take special classes for members of 'Maa Samooh' - a group of mothers who taste mid-day meals from time to time to check the quality of food.

""The percentage of women's literacy rate is even lower is some backward districts of the state. When parents are not educated, they are unable to inspire their children to go to schools and help the latter in their studies,"" said Sarvendra Vikram Bahadur Singh, UP education director.

Officials have asked all schools to make sure that each student from classes VI to VIII teaches at least one uneducated elder from her or his family after school hours. The initiative is being done with an aim to improve results of students, who are likely to learn in the process of educating their parents. The elders, in turn, can also help tutor kids at home.

""The students of junior high schools should also be asked to impart basic education to at least one illiterate person in their families within a period of three months,"" read Singh's order.

""They told me that I couldn't pass...that I was bad at studies,"" he said.

Dev is a student with a learning disability, who pursued his schooling in a government school in the city. His teachers and school principal convinced him that he cannot clear public exams like other students in his class. After clearing class 10 exams, he now pursues higher secondary schooling at Vidya Sagar, a centre for special education, and wants to work in the IT sector after.

He is one among scores of students with disabilities, who have been let down by the State's school education system. Although 1.36 lakh students with disabilities were enrolled in government and aided schools in 2016-17, only around a tenth of them received either a kit box, escort, or transport or more than one of them, according to the policy note of School Education Department 2017-18. Only 293 students were given braille study material although 18 per cent of all persons with disabilities are identified to have visual impairment according to 2011 census.

The census also reveals that literacy rate among persons with disabilities is about 60 per cent, when the State has a rate of 80 per cent. However, literacy rate may not reflect reality in schools, as students with disabilities are forced to drop out, mostly around class 8, as they are promoted through classes without actual integration into main-stream education until then, pointed Sujatha Sriram, a special educator.

""Children, with only mild disabilities survive education in main-stream government schools after that. Other students are asked to either drop-out, change discipline of study or learn from home,"" she said, adding that sometimes, parents are even made to wait the whole day to assist their wards. This is a problem, if the child is from an economically backward family, as an earning member of the family is forced to stay back to assist the child.

When Express visited government and government-aided schools in the city, only select blocks in many schools, even had basic inclusive Infrastructure like ramps. Staff from these schools confirmed that most of these ramps were laid, when their schools were polling booths. Such schools were accessible, only from the gate to the rooms that were used as polling booths. This left toilets in many schools inaccessible. ""I've had to hold my bladder till the end of the day until my mother came. Even though the toilet was in the ground floor, it was too small and difficult to access by myself on my wheelchair. I can't always ask for help,"" said Ram Kumar*, another government school student with physical disability.

Rajiv Rajan, the executive director Ektha foundation, who did a study of polling stations during 2016 elections, said that the ramps built in schools were too steep to access independently. ""Narrow corridors, and sandy approach to the ramps create major barriers for access,"" he said, emphasising that very few schools had proper access to toilets.

Vasantham Federation, an NGO, found through a sampled survey in Thiruvallur district, found that only 25 per cent of government schools at least had ramps. A total of 75 sample schools were surveyed. ""Ramps and building western toilets were the only infrastructural change made even in the 25 per cent of schools. Children with intellectual disabilities were being persuaded to discontinue after class 5. Barely any teacher knew sign language or braille,"" said A Lingston, from the federation.

With very little inclusive measures in place, only students who can verbally communicate well and have average cognitive development can complete their education in mainstream government schools, said Kalpana Rao, the principal of Vidya Sagar. When students can't express themselves properly, or need extra attention, or have multiple disabilities, schools even cite bullying as an excuse to wash their hands off the responsibility, she claimed.

""When Dev joined us, he was psychologically broken down and his self esteem was really poor. It took us three months to make him feel normal again,"" said Kalpana adding that teachers from the school, took Dev to every play, talk show, concert and performance in the city in those three months, in order to expose him to the various career options he had. ""We didn't need grand investments to re-integrate him into education. We just had to believe in him and had to invest a little extra time in him than usual,"" she said, adding that there at least 20 students like him who joined Vidya Sagar after dropping out of government schools.

Kalpana suggested that plausible inclusion strategy should be implemented strongly by the government. ""By the end of it, he voluntarily said that he wanted continue his education,"" she said.

Every school should be accessible to students with disabilities by 2019, according to the orders of the Supreme Court, said Pradeep Yadav, the principal secretary to the School Education Department. However, he did not specify the steps the state would take to implement this."

The promotions of Delhi government teachers under the government's modified assured career progression (MACP) scheme are pending since 2016. Under the MACP, the teachers only get monetary promotions. Their designations do not change.

Sanjay Goel, director at the DoE, told the daily that they have sent a communication to the department of personnel and training to clarify if the 'very good' benchmark is applied from 2016 or before that. He said that they followed the 7th Pay Commission guidelines as issued by the services department but further clarification is needed on the same.

The teachers' association had also written to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia earlier this month alleging that their present mode of evaluation was ""biased"".

The CCTV project was given an in-principal approval. These cameras will be installed in all corners of the schools, outside washrooms, vacant rooms and other inaccessible areas.

The proposal was announced by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal last year, under which parents would be able to access live feeds of their child's classroom though a mobile app. However, this invited severe criticism from educationists, and some sections of teachers even as principals cheered it as an aid to survey schools better.

A core committee was formed in December last year, which was entrusted with the job of preparing a road map, time-bound plan and oversee the function of installation of CCTV cameras in government schools.

In another decision, the cabinet also changed the name of school management committees to Vidyalaya Kalyan Samitis.

It was enhanced from Rs 1,050 to Rs 1,403 per day. The matter will now be submitted for approval to the lieutenant governor. DoE has been engaging guest teachers since 2010. The teachers are paid on a daily-wage basis.

The reduction in admissions in government schools reflects an increase in admissions in private schools, said an official from School Education Department, who did not want to be named.

""If there are large private schools with a strength of over thousand in an area, it attracts the admissions that government schools would have gotten without RTE.

In the midst of talks of government schools with low admissions running the risk of being closed down, a group of youngsters, who are government school alumni, have started 'Makkala Mane' in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk of Tumakuru district.

They -- alumni of government schools in Kallenahalli -- came up with the plan after two government schools in neighbouring Ranganakere and Marathipalya villages in Chikkanayakanahalli taluk were closed two years ago due to poor enrolments.

They decided to establish 'Suvarna Vidya Chethana', an organisation to save government schools by improving their student strength and offering English education in the pre-school years.

How the 'best teacher' turned around a school

The Zilla Parishad High School at Borgaon (P) Village is also giving private schools a run for their money. Over the last four years, there has been a steady flow of students from private schools to this government institution. It is not without a reason, as six students who studied in this school have made it to different IIITs. This sudden prosperity was ushered in around 2014, when the current headmaster N Ram Rao took charge. His funda was to focus on quality improvement. This, he believed, would help increase enrolment. And that formula has actually paid off. He was recently awarded the best teacher award by the Government of India. Like a magic, at least 70 students from different private schools have switched to this school after that. Rao attributes the success to teaching staff. ""The teachers are responsible for the change in perception about the school among the villagers,"" he says. Established in 1977, the school runs from a multi-storage building on 1.14 acre. It has 1,200 students studying in classes 6-10. The school's infrastructure is also robust. It has a digital education lab, playground and other facilities. Weekly sports and other extracurricular activities are conducted to ensure the holistic development of the students. The school also takes care of the health of the students and organises regular health camps with the help of medical and health department. The school now acts as a model example for government schools to learn and replicate.

The Government School Gazetted No 2 is giving tough competition to private schools, despite being a Telugu-medium one. It has classes 8-10 with two sections for each class. A total of 302 students study here. Interestingly, the school is situated in the heart of the town surrounded by English medium private schools. Still, it's witnessing steady growth in admissions over the years. This academic year, the school got 50 new admissions. This is primarily because the school is achieving good results. Established in 1935, it has also produced several luminaries. Apart from the robust infrastructure, the school also boasts of a Legal Literary Club for students to discuss various issues including harassment. Students from here have also participated in State level sports tournaments."

SORRY STATE OF SCHOOLS

Primary school in Davangere

The primary school at Chikka Arakere village in Jagaluru taluk of Davangere district was constructed five decades ago. Cracks have developed in walls and wooden beams are broken. There are chances of the roof and walls collapsing any time. Classes for 1st to 5th are conducted in one room. Many students have been pulled out by parents of late.

Municipal high school in Ballari

Education is being imparted in four medium of instructions in the building which served as a prison during British Raj. It was converted as an educational institution in 1935. Earlier, the student strength was 1,500-2,000. But due poor infrastructure, the strength has dipped to 589. Of 35 classrooms, 16 are not in use. A part of the roof has already collapsed. There are no doors and windows and students sit on the ground"

Two teachers each in all government and government-aided schools will be trained to hold the special one-hour-long class once a week.

""It helps to have trained teachers in school as children wouldn't visit a doctor unless they are sick, leading to many health conditions remaining undiagnosed for long. This way we will be able to pick up signs early and take preventive measures,"" said a senior health ministry official, requesting anonymity. In case of symptoms of any serious conditions, the child will be referred to a specialist.

""We are in the process of finalising the curriculum that is going to be largely interactive. We have made a conscious effort to design age-appropriate content to hold the interest of children. By month end the curriculum will be finalised and after that training will begin.""

India has 26 crore (260 million) school-going children studying in around 11 lakh (1.1 million)schools. Activities are being drafted for children in three categories -- classes 1 to 5 (primary), 6 to 8 (upper primary) and 9 to 12 (till senior secondary).

Health experts welcome the move ""Given the shortage of psychologists and psychiatrists, which is 300% and 250% respectively, I am totally for screening and support at the basic level. Even two counsellors per school is not enough as some schools have 5,000-6,000 children, so the counsellor cannot devote enough time to each one,"" says Dr Samir Parikh, director, department of mental health and behavioural sciences, Fortis Healthcare. The health ministry is taking up the project in partnership with human resource development ministry."
