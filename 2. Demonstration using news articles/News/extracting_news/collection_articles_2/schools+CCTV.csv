The move is on the heels of a police recommendation that schools be under CCTV surveillance as a precautionary measure.

The importance of this security measure on school premises was brought home by the alleged rape of a nine-year-old girl inside the toilet of her school in Vashi in September. The victim confided to her mother about the incident. She said, an unidentified person took her to a toilet after covering her mouth with a handkerchief and raped her. The incident took place as she was entering school. Since there were no CCTV cameras installed in the school, the accused was never identified.

Meanwhile, police will send notices to schools to take precautions to ensure the safety of students on the premises. Sudhakar Pathare, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 1), said, ""Apart from requesting schools to instal CCTV cameras, we have also asked schools to hire guards from certified security agencies, who can keep a record of people entering and leaving the school.""

DCP Pathare added, school management and staff should also ensure the CCTV footage be retained for at least a week, and not just for 24 hours, as is usually the practice. NMMC Commissioner N Ramaswamy said this proposal was tabled in the committee in March and the project is underway. ""At this juncture, the project is at tendering stage. All civic schools in the city will be under CCTV surveillance by the end of this financial year. Each school will be installed with CCTV cameras after thorough individual survey. The results of the survey will determine the number of cameras required per school.""

Explaining how installation of CCTV surveillance costs as low as Rs 14 per student, parents will not mind paying a minimal amount to ensure the safety and security of their children. Lopes Diago, Principal of St Xavier's School in Nerul said, ""Our schools are well-equipped with CCTV surveillance. Lack of funds cannot be an excuse for not having one. We have installed cameras everywhere and a student has to pay just Rs 14 more for the security.""Parents will breathe a sigh of relief over the decision, as it will mean improved alertness and security, said an educational activist."

After the alleged rape of a nine-year-old girl inside the toilet of her school in Vashi last week, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has decided to install CCTV cameras at all civic schools run by them. The task will be finished by end of this financial year, a senior officer said.

Installation of CCTV cameras in school premises was the topic of discussion in the satellite city last after the alleged rape of a minor girl came to light.

The girl said that an unidentified person took her to a toilet by covering her mouth with a handkerchief when she was entering her school and raped her inside it.

The private school had no CCTV camera and hence the police have not been able collect concrete evidences against anyone.

After the incident, parents had also staged a protest and asked the school authorities to install CCTV cameras on the premises.

Ramaswamy N, commissioner of NMMC, said, ""At beginning of this financial year, we had decided to install CCTV cameras on the premises of our schools. The project is in tendering process. We can say that all civic schools in the city will be under CCTV surveillance by end of this financial year.""

NMMC runs a total of 70 schools of which 53 are primary and 17 are secondary schools.

When asked about the number of cameras each school will get, Ramaswamy said, ""Individual surveys will be conducted at each school and the number of required cameras will be decided based on that. We will ensure the entire premises is covered.""

Meanwhile, the city police are sending notices to private schools to take precautionary measures to ensure safety of students on the premises.

Installation of CCTV cameras was one of the measures mentioned in the notice.

Sudhakar Pathare, deputy commissioner of police (zone 1), said, ""Apart from installing such cameras, we have asked the schools to hire guards from certified security agencies. They should also keep record of people who enter their compound.""

""Likewise, the school authorities should preserve the CCTV feed for a longer time as it may help in investigations,"" he said.

When asked if the police would take action if schools do not follow the guidelines, Pathare said, ""We cannot take any action under Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure or the Mumbai Police Act. The education department of NMMC will have to the action.""

Activists and parents of civic school students are happy with the civic body's decision.

Parshuram Rumale, 42, a parent of a child who studies in the Vashi school where the minor was raped, said, ""When a school has CCTV cameras, miscreants normally get scared to enter its compound. Every school should install such cameras.""

Ramesh Bhagat, 39, a parent of a child who studies in a Nerul school, said, ""Apart from cases like sexual assault, parents allege that kids are beaten up by teachers . If every classroom has CCTV cameras, there will never be such confusion.""

Sudhir Dani, 50, an education activist, said children's safety is more important than analysis of the existing rules.

""If something goes wrong inside the school, it's bad for the school too. Therefore, the schools should take it as their moral responsibility to install CCTV cameras,"" said Dani.

Father S Almeida, principal of Father Agnel Multipurpose School and Junior College, Vashi, said, ""We have installed CCTV cameras on the entire premises. They are monitored from the principal's room. It's not easy for a student to go out of the premises during school hours.""

""We also keep conducting workshops for our staff and ask them to treat the students with right manners. Thus, within our parameter, we have taken all precautionary measures. However it's tough to say that nothing can happen,"" he said.

An official from St Xavier's School in Nerul said, ""Lack of fund cannot be an excuse for not having CCTV surveillance. We have installed cameras everywhere and a student has to pay just Rs14 more for the security."""

The Maharashtra School Education department today issued guidelines for schools and junior colleges, mandating certain safety measures in students' interest.

A circular issued by the department said that every school and junior college should install CCTV cameras.

Attendance should be marked thrice a day, and if a student is found missing, parents should be informed immediately through a text message, the circular said.

No student should be punished in such a way that he or she would suffer a mental or physical trauma, it said.

The guidelines also restrict entry of unidentified persons on the school premises.

Character certificate from police would be mandatory for recruitment as teachers or other staff at educational institutions.

Washrooms for boys and girls should be separate and at a suitable distance from each other, and there should be a woman attendant at the girls' washroom, the guidelines say.

The woman attendant on school bus should not leave the bus until the last girl is dropped, the guidelines add.

The guidelines will apply to state board schools as well as those affiliated to CBSE, ICSE and international boards.

They would come into effect from the coming academic year.

Education minister Vinod Tawde said while the state government can not interfere in the curriculum of international boards, students' safety comes under the state's purview.

""Students are from Maharashtra, so all these schools should also follow these norms. If any school fails, the education department will lodge a police case,"" he said."
