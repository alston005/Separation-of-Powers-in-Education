In a report submitted to Medical Council of India (MCI), Dr Indrajit Khandekar said the test, which can be psychologically devastating for women, continues to be perceived as a clinical tool by virtue of being taught in medical schools, and therefore in certain instances has even been ordered by courts to decide cases. The doctor's letter, based on a study of nearly 30 MBBS and forensic medicine postgraduation textbooks, has also been sent to the Union health ministry on December 26.

The report stated the textbooks not just vividly taught students about virginity and techniques of hymen inspection for size or tears, but also spoke of ""false"" and ""true virgins."" Interestingly, while volumes were devoted to teaching female virginity, there was hardly any mention of male virginity in any textbook, Khandekar's letter said.

""Numerous studies have shown the inspection of hymen cannot give conclusive evidence of vaginal penetration or any sexual history. In fact, abnormal hymenal features such as laceration or an enlarged opening are found in females with or without a history of sexual activity. Yet our textbooks continue to teach future doctors about this unscientific test,"" said Dr Khandekar, who teachers at the Mahatma Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Sewagram. He medical students continue to be asked questions about virginity in exams. ""Till it stays in the curriculum, textbooks will devote chapters on this and students will continue to learn and perhaps practice when asked to perform such a test by the police or courts,"" said the forensic expert.

The SC had in 2013 banned use of the two-finger test on rape victims. Maharashtra was one of the first states to implement the ban and change medico-legal proformas. Recently, the state introduced genderintegrated modules in five disciplines. The Centre for Enquiry into Health and Allied Themes (CEHAT), along with the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) and Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), worked on the modules across five disciplines, including forensic medicine, to bring in gender perspective in medical education. ""These changes have started to reflect in textbooks taught in Maharashtra. But it needs to change across India,"" said Padma Deosthali of CEHAT."

The State government's decision to suspend a public information commissioner (PIO) for allegedly providing wrong information on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's flagship bullet train project is setting a wrong precedent for public servants, Right to Information activists warned on Saturday.

Former Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) Shailesh Gandhi said, ""The government must provide the necessary documentation to back its decision to suspend PIO Sarangkumar Patil of the State Home Department or else it will only be seen as sending out the message that State officials handing over information not favourable to the government will be severely dealt with.""

Mr. Gandhi told The Hindu, ""If the Maharashtra government feels that the PIO has provided wrong information, it must make public minutes of the meeting or dates when the meeting [of the Cabinet sub-committee on the project] actually took place. Or else this decision will be considered a fiasco.""

On Friday, Mr. Patil was suspended for giving information regarding a meeting of the Cabinet sub-committee set up to monitor progress of the flagship rail project. According to the information provided to applicant Jeetendra Ghadge on September 29, no meeting of the committee had taken place ever since it was set up.

The sub-committee members include the Chief Minister; Minister for Revenue, Relief and Rehabilitation, and Public Works Department Chandrakant Patil; Minister for Education Vinod Tawde; and Transport Minister Diwakar Raote. Mr. Raote was quoted in the media saying he was not aware of ""any sub-committee and do not remember attending anything pertaining to it.""

Mr. Ghadge said if the government has suspended the PIO for giving the ""wrong"" information, it must also suspend Mr. Raote for giving the same information. As per the documents verified, there is no record of any meetings or minutes of the same on the files, Mr. Ghadge said.

""In my inspection, I did not find a single sheet of paper mentioning the meeting. If the government is suspending the PIO for the information on that basis, it must give dates when these meetings took place,"" he said. The RTI activist said the suspension was simply a pressure tactic by the government to ""bully"" staff and prevent them from giving crucial information.

Meanwhile, State Chief Information Commissioner Sumit Mullick said it was the prerogative of the government to take action against erring officials. ""The CIC has no role in it and neither is it binding on the government to consult the CIC on this matter,"" he said.

Mr. Ghadge's RTI query raised serious questions on the economics of the project. A report of the State Transport Department was found, which highlighted several objections raised by State departments over the economic viability of the Shinkansen train, which could result in losses in the form of wasted Floor Space Index and delayed loan repayment in the absence of proper frameworks.

The train, with a capacity of 750 passengers, will travel at speeds between 320 km/hr and 350 km/hr and is expected to reduce travel time between Ahmedabad and Mumbai to three-and-a-half hours or less from the present eight. The project is expected to be completed in seven years."

According to LMD statement, following the complaints of parents against the Green Valley Educational Institute, Ellahi-Bagh for prescribing the text-books of the publisher namely Pearson India Education Services Pvt. Ltd, with inflated prices, the joint inspection of the school was conducted by the officers of LMD, Education department and Revenue department to ascertain the genuineness of the complaint.

""During the inspection, it was observed that the text-books for Class-I, Class-II and Class-III were in a packaged form carrying MRP of Rs 4500/-, Rs 5000/- & Rs 5000/- respectively. The one set of books (Class-III) was opened in presence of the book-seller and Executive Magistrate Class-I and it was found that none of the individual books in the pack carry the price. Even, the pack was without Urdu and computer books. Two sets of the books were seized from the book-seller and the case was registered against the publisher and book-seller for violation of provisions of Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rule,201,"" said an official

The LMD also issued a legal notice to the publisher company which ""in turn engaged the counsels to plead the case in the office of Deputy Controller LM (Consumer Protection) Kashmir.""

""After a threadbare discussion with the counsels of the publisher company, they confessed the lapse and gave an undertaking that they will follow the rules in letter and spirit. The case was compounded for Rs. 75,000,"" officials said."

These days, it is not unusual to see children, still sleepy, leave home before sunrise to sweat it out at tuition centres before racing off to school. School hours are, in many instances, sandwiched between expensive, back-breaking coaching sessions after which the children limp home -- bleary-eyed and exhausted -- by 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., or even later.

Acting on a set of complaints, the Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Friday issued orders to the State government to frame a law for regulating tuition/coaching centres and to ensure that children's rights are protected. The commission asked the Secretary, General Education, and the Director of Public Instruction (DPI), to ensure that such institutions are allowed to operate only in a child-friendly atmosphere.

Commission member Sreela Menon N., in her order, noted that while rules and regulations protected the rights of children in the school environment, no such framework protected them in tuition centres that have mushroomed in every nook and cranny of the State.

The commission's order came on two petitions filed by Sebi Joseph of Ancheri, Thrissur, and a group of parents. The petitioners, urging the commission's intervention, alleged that gross violation of children's rights was occurring at such institutions. They also wanted the commission to slap a ban on summer coaching classes that also have become a common feature.

Although the commission issued notices on the matter to the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI, it received the reply that the Education Department was helpless.

The Kerala Education Rules did not contain any provision to regulate tuition/coaching centres. In fact, Friday's order has come at a time when even veterans in the coaching classes sector have started to complain about excesses. P.C. Thomas of Thrissur, a pioneer in the field, welcomed the order, saying it was high time steps were taken to protect children. According to him, tuition/coaching centres have transformed into a 'mafia' in recent years.

""This has become a big business where the children are at the receiving end. There is no doubt that the rights of the children have to be protected. The government should introduce regulations and form inspection teams,"" Mr. Thomas said.

The commission has ordered the Secretary, General Education, and the DPI to file action-taken reports within 30 days of receiving copies of the order."

Private institutions, particularly engineering colleges, have been caught duplicating faculty for inspection, retaining academic and professional records illegally and employing insufficient or unqualified staff. For example, during a recent inspection conducted by All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) at DJR-CET College in Vijayawada, as many as 20 professors and assistant professors shown by the institution did not work at the college, but at its branches in Hyderabad, instead.

In the State, illegal retention of academic certificates by a private engineering college, allegedly led to the suicide of assistant professor T Vasanthavannan. Also, there is no aggregated data on the number of faculty in private higher educational institutions, making it difficult to deduce quality parameters.

Making verified digital academic records compulsory will drastically improve transparency in the system, said MK Surappa, Vice-Chancellor of Anna University, speaking to Express. ""If all certificates are verified and stored with the AICTE and other regulatory bodies, tampering with certificates or duplicating them becomes impossible,"" he said.

Even though it is illegal, most self-financed colleges withhold academic certificates claiming that it is easier to submit them for several inspections held each year. ""Private colleges primarily use certificates as leverage to prevent faculty from finding other jobs. They use them as a ransom,"" said KM Karthik, from the All India Private College Employees Union.

A senior member from Self-Financed Engineering Colleges Association said, ""When students sit for placements, they do not have to carry original records. The placement officers will be given their identification codes and they view it online,"" he said. Teachers too will benefit from the measures, he added."

Gehlot council carries a distinction in several fields. It has 18 MLAs who became first-time ministers. Also, a balance between the young and the old ministers is amplfied in the free hand given to the ministers of state.

There are 13 state ministers, 10 cabinet ministers apart from Gehlot and Pilot taking the strength of the council of ministers in Rajasthan to 25. Each minister of state has been allotted four to five portfolios. In a departure from the norm, each minister has received at least one or two departments of which they have independent charge. This essentially means they do not have to report to a cabinet minister and can work on, and decide independently within their respective departments.

Govind Singh Dotasara, who has become a minister for the first time, has been allotted three departments- Education, Tourism and Devasthan. His education portfolio comes with independent charge, while he will have to work under Cabinet minister Vishvendra Singh for tourism and Devasthan affairs.

Similarly, Bhanwar Singh Bhati has independent charge of higher education, in addition to revenue colonization and Command Area Development, for which his Cabinet superior is Harish Choudhary.

Mamta Bhupesh (women and child development), Arjun Bamnia (Tribal Area Development), Sukhram Vishnoi (Forest, Environment), Ashok Chandna (Youth Affairs, Skill Development), Tikaram Juli (Labour, Factories and Boilers inspection), Bhajan Lal Jatav (Home guards, Government Press), Rajendra Singh Yadav (Planning (Manpower), State Motor Garage) and Dr Subhash Garg (Technical Education, Sanskrit Education) will be working as independent ministers.

The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, which has been making rounds of canteens in private schools to check if they are providing nutritious food, found that in all the 10 cases so far, students are being given food high in fat, salt and sugar content, something that is strictly prohibited.

DCPCR has been inspecting the schools to ensure effective implementation of Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines, which are prepared by the central advisory committee of the body as advised by the Delhi high court in 2015. Recently, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights had asked states to ensure an effective implementation of the norms.

Ranjana Prasad, member DCPCR, said: ""NCPCR had decided to check if these guidelines were being followed and we are doing that in Delhi. We have so far covered 10 private schools in south Delhi. In most schools we saw that the canteens were selling HFSS food and gave whatever the students asked for. The children do not know what is good for them and what they should eat."" The canteens were serving burgers, chowmein and beverages -- all strictly prohibited in the guidelines.

A research recently published in the Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that there is a link between consumption of HFSS food and obesity. Numerous studies done among schoolchildren of Delhi, Amritsar and southern India show that the prevalence of overweight/obesity is high and on the rise. In urban post-pubertal children of Delhi, it increased from 16% in 2002 to about 24% in 2006. It is high among the affluent class and children of private schools compared to low and middle-income groups.

Apart from selling food that's high in sugar and fat content, none of these schools had a canteen policy in place.

""It is most surprising that none of the schools knew about the canteen policy. As per guidelines, the canteens are required to provide different kinds of food. They are supposed to have 80% of the menu as green food, which includes vegetables, fruits and others. It is important to raise awareness about it among schools, children and parents so that the children grow up healthy,"" said Prasad.

The inspection will be carried out in all the schools of the city and the Directorate of Education has recommended that the guidelines are strictly implemented."

The pressure on Rupani was quite high in the run-up to the 2017 Assembly elections as Congress looked menacing under Rahul Gandhi's renewed leadership while he relentlessly campaigned in Gujarat. Yet, the BJP won, and so did Rupani, who was once again elected from Rajkot (West).

As the Rupani government completes its first year in power on 26 December, The Quint takes a closer look at the highs and lows of Vijay Rupani's regime in Narendra Modi's Gujarat.

1. Low: An Uncomfortable Power-Sharing Arrangement

The equation shared by Vijay Rupani and his deputy Nitin Patel was often cited as an uncomfortable one, as Patel was touted to be CM Anandiben Patel's replacement in 2016.

After winning the Assembly election in 2017, Dy Chief Minister Nitin Patel was visibly disgruntled by the portfolios issued to him - Roads and Buildings, Health, Medical Education, Narmada, Kalpsar and Capital Project. Patel had wanted to retain portfolios that he held before the Assembly elections such as finance and urban development.

Rumours were rife that Patel was planning to quit the BJP and several senior BJP leaders from the state met him to work out a compromise. Eventually, Patel was handed the finance portfolio after BJP national president Amit Shah intervened to avoid the embarrassment of public infighting between its two top leaders in Gujarat.

2. Low: Poor Water Management

Despite experiencing heavy rainfall in 2017, which resulted in massive flooding across North Gujarat, especially in Banaskantha district, Gujarat entered 2018 with a water crisis looming over its head. Fingers were pointed at the Rupani government for misusing water resources in the run-up to the 2017 Assembly elections.

According to the Central Water Commission, the water levels in reservoirs in 2018 were lower than the levels in 2017. Incidentally, an unusual amount of water was released in to Narmada between 12-17 September, just when Sardar Sarovar Dam was inaugurated by PM Modi on 17 September.

As the situation worsened in 2018, the state government declared that it would ration water during peak summer and both urban dwellers and farmers were severely affected.

In fact, Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) declared that it will not be responsible for any lossesto farmers due to lack of water in the Narmada canal. SSNNL also asked farmers not to prepare for summer crops with expectations of getting water for irrigation.

3. Low: The Groundnut Scam

During the 2017 Assembly Election campaign, the BJP promised Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,500/quintal for groundnuts against the prevailing market price of Rs 3,700. Eventually, the state government purchased over 10 lakh metric tonnes of groundnuts worth Rs 4,000 crore.

The year 2018 started with a series of fires that gutted at least four groundnut warehouses in Saurashtra and Kutch, destroying stock worth at least Rs 50 crore. The situation hit rock bottom in August, when an inspection of a private warehouse in Saurashtra revealed that over 30,000 groundnut sacks weighing 35 kilos was adulterated with pebbles and sand.

The Leader of Opposition, Paresh Dhanani, while demanding Rupani's resignation, has alleged that cooperative societies controlled by BJP supporters were picked for operating groundnut procurement centres. According to Dhanani, groundnuts of good quality were diverted to oil mills run by BJP supporters.

Even the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Limited (NAFED) declared that it will not procure groundnuts in Gujarat due to irregularities in procurement in 2017.

In November 2018, Rupani conceded that there was indeed a scam in procuring groundnuts in 2017, and measures were being taken to ensure that such scams don't recur.

4. High: Kunvarji Bavaliya Joins BJP

Koli community strongman Kunvarji Bavaliya joined the BJP in July this year, further strengthening the BJP's foundations in Saurashtra. Bavaliya, who was Congress loyalist, was quite unhappy with Rahul Gandhi's decisions in Gujarat Congress, which led to the appointment of young Paresh Dhanani as leader of opposition instead of a seasoned Bavaliya.

After the election, Bavaliya was immediately given three portfolios - water resources, rural housing development and animal husbandry - along with a Cabinet berth. Bavaliya won the Jasdan by-poll held on 20 December with a margin of over 19,000 votes.

With Bavaliya in the fold, the BJP feels more confident about its chances in Saurashtra in the 2019 general elections, as the region is dominated by the Koli Patel community. Saurashtra has seven key Lok Sabha seats including Rajkot, which Bavaliya won in the 2009 polls on a Congress ticket.

The victory in Jasdan also took BJP's tally to 100 in the Gujarat Assembly.

The report is to be submitted before the end of February. Officials say that report will form the basis for the new government to frame policies and likely to scrap those with no or minimal impact.

Shyam Singh Rajpurohit, director, education department, held a meeting in Bikaner on Monday and gave instructions to the education officials for the inspection. TOI repeatedly called him but he didn't respond. The report is covering two third of the government schools and would require a force of education department officials.

""It is a very big sample and will be used to prepare an in depth report about how the schemes like mid-day meals, transport voucher, parents-teacher meeting, rewards to students like laptops, bicycles and mopeds fared in the state,"" said an official.

""Certainly, government has to carry out such exercise to achieve its multi-fold objective: to analyse the previous government schemes and to build base for the new government to form its schemes and policies. It is a good exercise, if they do it with fairness,"" said K B Kothari, managing trustee of Pratham NGO.

Meanwhile, instructions were also given to complete the pending work related to the Right to Education act reimbursements to the private schools. The act mandates that every private schools have to admit 25% of students from the economically weaker and marginalized sections.

On account of these admissions, government pays reimbursement to these schools in two instalments. State has not provided the first installments to the private schools. Purohit instructed that these schools should be given reimbursements in January 2019."

The Modi-led government started the Swadhar Greh scheme for homeless women in 2015. The Ministry of Women and Child Development released funds to the tune of nearly Rs 200 crore to 559 shelter homes. What is all that money meant to do?

The funds are supposed to be used to house homeless women in need of shelter, and to provide skills training so that they can look for work and become financially independent. They are supposed to shelter women between the age group of 18-60 years.

But the National Commission For Women (NCW) submitted a report to the ministry in December revealing the 'poor and deplorable' condition in 25 out of 26 homes in Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Karnataka and West Bengal.

According to the Chairperson of NCW, Rekha Sharma, the licences of the NGO running these homes should be cancelled immediately.

""They (Ministry for Women and Children) have a mechanism to check on shelter homes immediately. If we (Central government) are providing money to the shelter homes, then it should go into the right hands, it shouldn't be misused. Before giving out the next budgets, a proper check should be carried out on each and every NGO that is running a shelter house. Or else their licences should be cancelled, or we should invite new NGOs.""Rekha Sharma, Chairperson, National Commission for Women

The government is yet to take any action based on the report.

Major Findings

Some of the major findings of the NCW mentioned inadequate facilities and unclean, even dangerous conditions in the shelter homes: ""Unkempt mentally ill-women with no medical aid,"" ""dirty and unhygienic kitchens,"" ""cramped rooms, no beds or mattresses to sleep on"".

The report says some women complained of being forced to live in the shelter home rather than just stay to gain skills, while others detailed accounts of physical torture and a lack of counselling facilities. Some NGOs were even running these government shelters as hostels, illegally charging these destitute women fees for their stay.

The NCW has made strong recommendations to the Ministry of Women and Child Development to try and address these problems. They include measures like only employing women to run the homes, ensuring these homes aren't located in isolated, remote areas, and insisting that proper records of all these homes are maintained across the country.

Jayaprakash Institute of Social ChangeWhen the women were questioned, they informed the NCW Committee that the NGO workers go out and solicit donations of food and clothes for the women staying there. These shelter homes are receiving crores in funding from the Central government, and are not supposed to fund care of the women through begging for donations.Many women also complained that they are subjected to physical torture by the counselor of the Swadhar Greh.The Committee found that seven of the women were intellectually disabled, and observed that this Swadhar Greh was run like a 'congested prison'.The women were not receiving proper medical care.

She said the NGO was not providing her with the medication she needed. Despite saying she wanted to go back to her parents, she complained that the NGO was forcing her to stay in the shelter home.Most of the inmates complained that they wanted to return to their families, but that the NGO was making no efforts to assist them in doing so.The inmates complained that the NGO was not taking good care of them, refusing to render medical or legal aid to them or their children.

Effective midnight, Friday, December 21st, there is a partial federal government shutdown in effect.

Earlier this week, the National League of Cities (NLC) called on federal leaders to do their jobs and find a bipartisan solution to avoid a shutdown and keep every federal agency open.

""Cities expect our leaders in Washington to meet their most basic obligation and keep the federal government open,"" said NLC President Karen Freeman-Wilson, mayor of Gary, Indiana. ""A federal shutdown would impact programs that grow local economies and build more resilient communities. Instead of wasting $6.5 billion a week on a shutdown, let's put that money to good use -- by investing in America's cities.""

This would be a ""partial"" shutdown because Congress met the deadline to approve five of the twelve total appropriations bills. In addition to all ""mandatory"" spending programs, federal discretionary grant programs administered through the following agencies will not be impacted by the partial shutdown:

For city leaders, this means residents can expect uninterrupted operations and payments from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. VA Hospitals and other service providers for veterans should remain open. Before and after school programs funded by the Department of Education's 21 Century Community Learning Center grants should not be interrupted.

Unfortunately for city leaders, the federal agencies that will be shutting down to various degrees are those that administer most federal grants allocated directly to municipal governments, including:

According to this detailed Q&A from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, when a funding lapse results in the shutdown of a federal agency, the government must discontinue all non-essential discretionary functions until new funding legislation is passed and signed into law. And according to this White House Shutdown FAQ, all normally, routine, ongoing operational and administrative activities relating to contract or grant administration (including payment processing) cannot continue when there is a lapse in funding. Moreover, federal agency employees who are paid with annual appropriations and who perform an activity associated with contract or grant administration (including oversight, inspection, payment or accounting) should generally not continue work during a lapse in appropriations.

In other words, federal discretionary grants that are administered to local governments from unfunded federal agencies, including HUD's CDBG and HOME grants, DOJ's COPS grants, DOT's TIGER grants, EDA's economic development grants, SBA's small business loans, and USDA's rural loans and grants, will be unavailable for reimbursement to local governments, and agency staff will generally be unavailable to answer questions or offer technical assistance throughout the duration of the partial government shutdown. Any local employees funded by federal grants may also be required to stop work.

The White House Office of Management and Budget maintains a list of each agency's plans here. Additional contingency information may be posted on individual agency websites as well.

A short shutdown of a week or less will have little to no impact on cities (although it will cost the federal government plenty to furlough employees, mothball offices, and reopen even a short time later). The effects of a longer shutdown would multiply quickly, including inaccessible federal funding, project delays and potential layoffs. As federal funding for services dry up, residents usually expect local governments to step in with supplemental funding. Eventually it will fall on cities and states to bear the cost of the shutdown on the broader economy, which will result in less tax revenue for all levels of government.

The federal law that prohibits agencies from incurring obligations in advance of appropriations, the Antideficiency Act, also requires an ""orderly shutdown"" when there has been a lapse in appropriations. Of course, actual government shutdowns are anything but orderly, and there will be exceptions and inconsistencies across the board, known and unknown.

Among the known exceptions and inconsistencies, if there is a partial government shutdown:"

The Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Ranchi, will evaluate the merger of primary schools in Jharkhand. The state education department has roped in the institute for a detailed study of 4,600 merged schools to find out if the reorganisation has brought about any improvement or not, department officials said.

State education secretary AP Singh said, ""IIM Ranchi would see if the reorganisation has brought any benefits for students as well as the education system. It would also evaluate if the initiative brought about any improvement in the education of those students who were shifted to other schools in the merger process,"" he said. ""We have sought a financial proposal from the institute for the study.""

The reorganisation exercise of schools had also caught the interest of IIM Bangalore, which expressed its willingness to carry out a study on the process and its benefits, said the secretary.

Merging schools with low enrolment is an exercise that has been undertake by Rajasthan and Jharkhand in the country with the support of the Union government and NITI (National Institution for Transforming India) Aayog, the policy think tank of the Government of India. Jharkhand started the merging procedure in 2016-17.

Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) director Uma Shankar Singh said that there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under the education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or fewer students. These schools had an average of one or two teachers per school. Providing quality education was a major challenge. One teacher was handling four-five classes at a time. How could one expect a better education in these schools?"" he said.

The council said that a four-step process -- field inspection; cross-district verification; block and district consultation; and final notification -- was undertaken to merge the schools.

Singh said that 98% students from the 4,600 primary schools had been shifted and 96% of the students had expressed satisfaction with the consolidation. ""We faced difficulty in shifting 150 schools due to some technical reasons. Now, the issue has been resolved, and students from 120 schools have been shifted,"" he said.

The reorganisation of primary schools benefited seven lakh students, giving them better teacher availability, and cut the requirement of 4,500 teaching positions. The merger process saved the government Rs 400 crore by reducing teaching positions and infrastructure requirements, said JEPC officials. The officials added that the funds thus saved would be spent on strengthening the education infrastructure of the merged schools."

Rocky Mittal, the programme director of the government reform programme 'Ek aur Sudhaar', visited the school for an inspection on Friday and asked the girls about their problems.

Three students of Class 6 told him that the teacher of the primary school, located across the road from the girls' school, used to sexually harass them around a year ago.

""A number of girls started crying when they were asked about their issues. Even the teachers admitted how they have seen the girls being subjected to harassment by miscreants outside the school.

After merger of 4,600 primary schools, the Jharkhand government is planning to shut over 6,466 middle schools (classes 6 to 8), having less than 100 students.

These schools would be merged with upgraded high schools in phases, starting with the institutions, which have less than 50 students, education department officials said on Thursday.

Initially, 3,732 middle schools having less than 50 students would be undertaken for merger. The process of merging has already been started.

""Merger is an effort to provide quality education to students in a better educational ambience. Jharkhand has around 411 such middle schools where number of students is less than 10. If these schools are merged with high schools, students would get better education,"" said state education secretary AP Singh.

""As per the rules in the right to education (RTE), there should be at least three trained graduate teacher (TGT) in middle schools where number of students is less than 100. It means, we would have to afford additional Rs 18 lakh on teachers' salary even in the schools where number of students is less than 10, which is not logical,"" he added.

The decision comes at a time when the opposition parties and critics have been criticising the state government for merging the primary schools. Several ruling party elected representatives have also been lobbying with the government against the move. There have been protests in several parts of the state as well, against merger of schools.

The officials, however, argue that, ideally, there should be one middle school and five to seven primary schools in a panchayat. As many as 6,466 middle schools have been identified in Jharkhand, which could be merged with high schools within a 5-km radius in a panchayat, Jharkhand Education Project Council (JEPC) officials said.

The state government has decided to offer bicycles to the students, who would be shifted to other schools so that they do not face any trouble in commuting to the school.

Meanwhile, the JEPC officials said they have completed the merging exercise of 4,600 primary schools.

JEPC director Uma Shankar Singh said there were 39,600 schools in 2016-17 under education department in Jharkhand. ""Of them, 18,000 schools had 60 or few students.

We have all gathered here today to showcase and commend the remarkable contribution of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry and Academia. A glance at the list of presentations, planned for the next three days, reveal the amazing diversity of research and innovations in the pharma sciences. The next three days will enrich us on topics ranging from APIs; generic formulations; diagnostics and medical devices; to biosimilar; pharmacovigilance; clinical research; herbal drugs and many more.

The global spending on medicines is expected to reach over $1.4 trillion by 2022, growing at an average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.38 per cent from $1.13 trillion in 2017. India is known globally for being a leading supplier of quality, affordable drugs to more than 200 countries. It has the highest number of USFDA approved plants, outside the USA. India accounts for the second largest number of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and is global leader in Drug Master Files (DMFs) applications in the US. India also has second largest share of pharma and biotech workforce in the world. Overall market opportunity remains large for Indian pharma companies. While in developing nations, market is characterised by high per capita spending, high availability and access to life saving drugs, however, this is not the case for developing countries. Demographic changes in population and advances in medical treatments are expected to translate into a rise in per capita spending in developing nations. Innovation in medicines, along with economic progress, will result in a rise in volume as well access to medicines.

In the past few years, our Government has been actively working to make healthcare more accessible to the people of India. Initiatives such as 'Ayushman Bharat' and 'Jan Aushadhi Kendra' are good examples in the regard. The 'Make in India' initiative of the government has indeed been most successful in the field of pharma. Other initiatives like 'Kaushal Bharat Kushal Bharat' for skill development and 'Digital India' are also promising and innovative ways of strengthening pharma industry in the country.

While we all are proud that every third tablet in the world is 'Made in India' however, the pie of the pharma business captured by Indian pharma companies in terms of dollar value is very small. The Indian pharma market is the third largest in terms of volume and thirteenth largest in terms of value. To put things into perspective, Indian pharma industry registered sales of value. To put things into perspective, Indian pharma industry registered sales of $36.7 billion in 2017, while overall global market was $1.13 trillion in 2017. It is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR of 22.4 per cent to reach $ 55 billion by 2020. Indian pharma industry has till date focused on generic medicines, wherein we have been able to garner high volume share, however, have lagged behind in market share in terms of dollar value. We are global leader in quality generic drug manufacturing, however, we are yet to develop a strong, research-based pharma industry that can produce innovative medicines. We need to undertake several initiatives across infrastructure, regulatory framework, and human resources etc. to place India as preferred destination for pharma innovation.

With changing global landscape, it is imperative for companies today to identify new engines of growth and invest more in innovation. It is a good sign that some of the companies are already trying to move up the value chain and investing in innovative specialty and complex generics products. In order to build an ecosystem of innovative products coming from Indian pharma industry, it would require some early adopters to taste success with innovative products, for others to follow the suit and invest, since this would require long term commitment. This would require Indian entrepreneurs and pharma companies to augment their capacity and capability for driving research, development and manufacturing of innovative products.

Adequate regulatory framework, commensurate with the global standards is required to support investment on innovative products and expedite per-clinical research, clinical trial and launch of new drugs. Time-bound implementation of policy interventions is a prerequisite for India to realise its innovation potential and vision. New medicines require extensive clinical trails to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Clinical trial activity in India is lower than that in other BRIC countries and several other developing nations.

Lengthy approval processes and timelines and available infrastructure pose a significant challenge in terms conducting clinical trial in India, hence several companies prefer to do clinical trials outside India in order to bring their drugs faster to market. Since companies don't pursue clinical trails in India, it hampers clinical trial capability building at our medical institutions, hospitals as well as for medical practitioners and others involved.

In order to promote innovation, Government is working towards bringing suitable regulatory frameworks and taking steps to strengthen the capability of our regulatory agencies. We have already started moving in the right direction, with Government seeking comments on draft amendments in Schedule M (Good Manufacturing Practices), Pharmacovigilance System Inspection Guideline and New Drugs and Clinical Trails Rules.

Co-ordination between Central Regulator, which approved new medicines and State Regulators, which grant manufacturing licenses as well as conduct inspection, also have to be strengthened in order to streamline time required for any new drug approval. Augmentation of physical infrastructure in terms of testing laboratories, of central and state regulatory authorities are also of utmost importance,in order to ensure that drugs manufactured in India, whether consumed in India or exported, are safe, efficacious and meets global quality standards. Moreover, regulatory bodies need human resources with adequate technical knowledge on innovation, in order to approve or disprove innovations, as well as to comply with global quality standard. Agencies have already started hiring manpower with suitable technical knowledge and additional skill sets. In order to ensure global recognition of product quality, Government desires to become a member of Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S).

Academia and industry are two important pillars of our economy. A robust collaboration between the two will augur well for developing our economy, enabling innovation and growth in the education system and producing an employment-ready workforce. We need skilled workforce equipped with the right knowledge. The curriculum and syllabus at Pharma Graduate and Post Graduate level should continuously be upgraded in line with newer regulations, guidelines, innovations and research, to keep it relevant and contemporary. Compared to other countries, India has been behind in quality research output both in terms of publications as well as citations. There is a need for improvement in the quality of our research output as well as better transfer of knowledge and technology between industry and academia. Industry R&D Centers are better equipped in terms of latest infrastructure, a better partnership between Industry and Academia will help in bringing out better quality research outputs from our students.

Price regulations by governments and reimbursement pressures in regulated markets may impact adoption of novel medicines as well as innovation of new medicines. Hence, it's important for Industry and Academia to collaborate in order to bring down the cost of innovation and bring novel medicines in the market. Industry and educational institutes need to build a constructive framework for collaboration to make India a global innovation hub.

In summing up, with the existing calibre of Indian pharma sector, newer advances in research, industry-academia partnership as well as economic driven government policies, will take the Indian pharma sector to newer heights and support innovation.

Last but not least, I encourage you to visit the Expo, showcasing latest developments in pharmaceuticals, technology and machineries.

Also, allow me to thank our Guest of Honor, as well as those who encourage us in one way or the other, and contributed towards successful opening of this Congress. I would also like to thank all the participants, especially those who came from abroad, for joining us and sharing their valuable experience and ideas.

I sincerely hope that this 70 Indian Pharmaceutical Congress act as a collaborative platform for sharing of information, ideas and encourage innovation. I will close my address with the famous saying of Hippocrates - ""Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is a love of humanity."""

Alleging that the inspections by the government teams are ""motivated"" and ""an attempt just to tarnish the image of civic bodies"", the education committees of both south and north corporations have directed their officials not to let the ""survey teams enter the school premises"".

The government has asked Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) to assess each government, private, and municipal school on parameters like safety, teaching-learning facilities and community engagement. DCPCR is the statutory body to monitor implementation of rights of children and Right To Education Act, 2009 in the city.

The chairperson of the south corporation's education committee, Nandini Sharma, said the House had already rejected the inspection proposal. ""The survey teams had taken permission from us three months ago after showing us a set of questions. But now they have completely changed their track, which is unacceptable."" These inspections also disrupt entire work in schools, she added. ""No permission is sought from the principals and committee members barge into classrooms,"" she alleged.

Sharma's counterpart in the north corporation, Ritu Goel, said she had directed education officials to discontinue the visits with immediate effect. ""We had agreed to the exercise keeping child welfare in mind but the government is using it politically to malign the image of corporation schools."" Goel said she had received complaints from 20-25 teachers about the conduct of inspection teams.

The little kids are asked ""motivated"" questions, Goel alleged. ""Which brave child gets beaten by teachers? Which good student brings the tea for teachers? When a teacher is talking on mobile phones then you don't disturb them -- such types of questions are being asked,"" she said. ""The purpose is only to create a controversy.""

Showing the files about the ""agreed-upon"" questions, she added that the survey was meant to be about issues like safety of kids, guard rooms and visitors in the school. Corporation officials were also asked to provide details of students' family members but they are yet to send any information.

DCPCR member Anurag Kundu, however, claimed that the corporations couldn't legally stop the inspections. ""DCPCR is not under Delhi government and it is an independent statutory body. It is legally obligated to monitor implementation of RTE Act in all schools. The education committee has no authority to stop us,"" he said.

Kundu said the teams were asking the questions agreed upon in joint meetings in September. ""The questions cited by the education committees are not being asked. Only questions like how do you feel in classroom? Are you allowed to ask questions,"" he added.

He also pointed out that Quality Council of India, a central government agency, had been selected as the project management agency for the survey."

Ever since Anjali Kumari, a Class X student of Bihar government-run GA High School in Lalganj, spoke up against the caste-wise sitting arrangement at her school, all benefits she is entitled to under various government schemes have been put on hold, allegedly by the school administration.

On Wednesday, the girl, in a written complaint to Lalganj Block Education Officer (BEO) Arvind Kumar Tiwari, maintained that ""making students enrol and sit in classrooms on lines of caste (social groups) is violation of our fundamental rights.""

Another Class IX student of the school also said the practice has been going for the past four years.

The segregation of students on castelines came to light after the Vaishali District Education Officer sent a team to the school on Monday. A detailed inspection report in this regard has been sent to State Secondary Education Director.

According to school records, the GA High School has more than 1,500 students in Classes IX to XII, and castes of each student is mentioned against their names on attendance sheets, reportedly to ""help the school administration to easily identify beneficiaries"" of all government schemes.

The attendance sheets have been seized by the Vaishali District Secondary Education Office.

Under various government schemes, a Class IX student is entitled to Rs 3,000 to purchase a bicycle; girl students from Classes IX to XII are entitled to Rs 1,000 for uniform and Rs 150 for sanitary napkins; students from Classes IX to XII are also entitled to Rs 1800 scholarship annually.

All the benefits are, however, given only against 75 per cent attendance.

Claiming that the report of compliance on government schemes are sought every month, and at times fortnightly, the school's in-charge principal, Meena Kumari, said: ""My predecessor, Phool Mohammed Ansari, had introduced segregation on caste lines in attendance register in 2014 and I have been following it because it has comes as handy to identify beneficiaries and prepare the reports.""

Dismissing the allegations of ""dividing students on caste lines"", she, said: ""One should know that we have only six classrooms, which can accommodate maximum 600 students. As we have a daily attendance of 50-60 per cent, we have to merge two sections (of a class) daily... There is no feeling of discrimination on caste lines.

Snake robot are automating systems that provides compelling enhancement in the efficiency of surgery and infiltration of spaces that were previously impenetrable. These are portable devices and are extension to existing robotic arms. It is also known as Snakebot and resembles to that of biological snakes. The first snake like robot was built by Prof. Hirose in 1972. These snake robots comes in different sizes, shapes & designs. These are pretty mobile and are built on hardware and software technology. It has two significant qualities, one of the quality is its ability to maneuver through and move into confined spaces. The other quality includes the ability to change the shape of its body that allows them to perform in wide range of circumstances, such as climbing tree trunks or climbing stairs. Furthermore, most snake robots are composed by chaining a number of independent links together. This adds redundancy in snake robots that makes them resistant to breakdown, even if the some part of the robots being destroyed. Properties such as redundancy, high terrain ability and complete scaling of the robot body makes snake robot very alluring for constructive application. These are mostly used in confined spaces. Confined spaces exist in aircraft wings, nuclear reactors, industrial processing plant, the human body, underwater environments space and ship-building. Roads, buildings, pipelines and other human spaces all have confined spaces. Snake robots have a slender, long and flexible design without any protrusions thus they can easily maneuvered into any position and retract back without disturbing their environment.

Won't work. Ultimately it is a question of choice whether families want to keep it small and simple or pull out all the stops. Alternatively, if we argue that people could instead donate to charitable causes, what if they're already doing so? That said wasting food, water, power etc., and burdening the environment is criminal. While we do what makes us happy let's urge people to act responsibly.

Radhika Dhruv

Concerning 'legal interference' at present time, I do think that it should be applicable to weddings. Not for the maximum number of attendees albeit, it can be proposed that those with a x crore-plus budget contribute to a welfare fund. Now that the country's economy is developing on a global stage, it would not be fair to restrict the big fat Indian weddings for those who can easily afford it. India is always known for its rich culture and heritage values, and what better way can it be to showcase our glorious traditions than such big fat Indian weddings. I strongly believe that such weddings do generate a lot of employment and promote small-scale businesses, local art and the country's diverse culture.

Dhipthi Dona J

Big fat Indian weddings do generate employment and open up opportunities to people from varied sections of the society, provided the organiser consciously chooses whose service they procure. The government could, probably, regulate and insist upon the importance of conducting events in a sustainable fashion.

Manepalli Vinay Babu

Weddings are definitely not an event to exhibit our wealth and visitor count. Marriage is the next phase in life and needs to be welcomed with simplicity, and in my opinion, legal concurrence and a close-friend level celebrations are good enough. The money could be channeled towards more qualitative and productive avenues such as charity, starting a business or still better education.

Sudharshan Aravindakshan

Having lavish weddings indeed generates work for small businesses and locals but is that kind of work all we can offer our people. I truly believe we are working with what we have and not what is appropriate to earn a decent wage. Unorganised employment is a bane for any economy as it gives room for corruption undercutting and eventually helps rich get richer and poor become poorer.

Arva MK

Weddings must be a simple affair with a few close family and friend. It is more about sharing the most special moment of your life with your loved ones rather than having an affair of pomp. The big fat weddings or even destination weddings are becoming more of grand events than being beautiful moments of exchange of vows between two individuals. And I personally feel it's becoming more of a competition too. I feel there are much better ways to create employment opportunities for locals and small businesses, than this.

Pratigya Yadav

It is the need of the hour to limit expenditure on lavish weddings, including the number of guests and amount of food served to avoid wastage of resources. The food Inspection Raj introduced in 1965, where 25 people were invited to the wedding is again needed in our country. Even after gaining independence, we are not yet independent of poverty, hunger, and more. Lakhs of poor and underprivileged people sleep without having three meals.

Shatakshi Nigam

For the affluent, this becomes an opportunity to showcase all their riches, project themselves in a light different from the rest. But this perspective of aloofness, a craving to belong to an affluent class, creating a social image might lead to dire consequences like spending more than what one cannot afford and ultimately ending up in a vicious cycle of debt and bearing the agony all throughout life just for a day of gala affair. On one hand, it looks like just a lot of money, on the other hand, it is also an opportunity for many locals to earn.

Karthik Setty

There is a lot of negativity surrounding lavish Indian weddings and many a time we can see social media and public going against it. In today's India, a lot of youngsters are thinking out of their 10-5 jobs and they're becoming entrepreneurs. These weddings open up a lot of possibilities for such entrepreneurs. I personally know a retired bank employee who makes a good living as a wedding planner and he also has a big network of people who depend on such wedding ceremonies.

In April, 2018, Shanghai Police Bureau disclosed several crimes regarding infringing citizen's private information, one of which was that more than 10 million pieces of private information have been illegally disclosed and traded by two former employees and two current employees of an insurance company over less than six months, with illegal amount of over 20 million RMB (Chinese Yuan).

On May 30, 2018, the former China Insurance Regulatory Commission, Jiangsu Bureau released ""The Warning on Prevention of Disclosure Risk of Private Information of Insurance Customers"", pointing out that recently crimes regarding infringing citizen's private information occurred in Jiangsu Province and local branches of life insurance companies and insurance agencies should give top priority on customers' private information protection, and take solid measures to prevent private information from leakage risks.

Financial institutions shall pay attention to legal issues regarding private information as set forth below:

Article 31 of the Cyber Security Act of China and the Regulation on Critical Information Infrastructure Security Protection (Draft for Comments) specifically indicate that finance sector is within the scope of critical information infrastructure. On June 2016, the Central Office of Cyber Security and informationization and Cyber Security Coordination Bureau released ""The Operating Guideline on National Cyber Security Inspection"", which explicitly enumerates banking operations, securities and futures trading, payment and clearing, insurance operations of the financial sector into the scope of critical information infrastructure.

After identifying critical operations, financial institutions may sort out, on a case-by-case basis, information systems or industrial control systems that support critical business operations or are related to critical business, forming a list of candidate critical information infrastructures, including website type, platform type and production business type. Each type shall be subject to different standards, and shall be protected as critical information infrastructure if it may result in: (1) the disclosure of private information by more than 1 million persons or; (2) the disclosure of sensitive information of a large number of institutions or enterprises, or; (3) other systems that may severely damage the social and economic order or endanger national security.

Subject to stricter national security reviews and assessments, the operator of critical information infrastructure would confront with stricter requirements of cybersecurity protection, including procurement of network products and services, the storage and transmission of private information and critical business data.

The Cyber Security Law of China defines ""Private Information"" as a variety of information recorded electronically or otherwise which could identify a natural person individually or in combination with other information, including, but not limited to, the name of the natural person, date of birth, identity document number, personal biometric information, home address, phone number, etc.

The People's Bank of China defines private information generated in the banking and financial industries in ""The Notice of Banking Financial Institutions Regarding Private Financial Information Protection"" as ""personal financial data"", including personal identifiable information, personal property information, personal account information, personal credit information, personal financial transaction information, derivative information, and other personal information obtained or stored in the course of establishing business relations with individuals.

Being released and executed by the Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine and Standardization Administration of the People's Republic of China on May 1, 2018, ""The Standard of Private Information Security of Information Security Technology"" (""The Private Information Security Standard"") distinguishes private information from sensitive private information and other general information. Sensitive private information refers to private information that, once disclosed, illegally provided or misused, may endanger the safety of persons and property, and may further lead to damages of personal reputation, physical and psychological health or discriminatory treatment, including ID numbers, personal biometric information, bank account number, communication records and content, property information, credit information, tract information, accommodation information, health care information, transaction information, personal information of children under 14 years of age (including), etc.

When dealing with the protection of private information, financial institutions shall pay attention to important private sensitive information and give stricter protection, especially in regards of personal tract information, communication records and content, credit information, property information, accommodation information, health care information, transaction information, etc., failing to appropriately protect such sensitive information in these important categories may give rise to criminal liability.

The Judicial Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in Criminal Cases of Infringement of Citizens' Personal Data (effective as of June 1, 2017) by the Supreme Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate indicates circumstances that constitute ""aggravated circumstances"" and violate Article 253 of Criminal Law of China as the ""crime of infringement private information of citizens"": (1) illegally obtain, sell or provide tract information, communication content, credit information, property information over 50 pieces, or; (2) illegally obtain, sell or provide accommodation information, communication records, health care information, transaction information that may affect the safety of persons or property more than 500 pieces, or; (3) illegally obtain, sell or provide other forms of citizen's private information over 5,000 pieces, or with illegal income more than RMB 5,000. When constituting a crime of financial institution, it shall impose a fine on the institution and punish the person in charge and other persons with direct responsibilities.

Strengthening the protection of private information shall follow the principles of legality, legitimacy and necessity in the process of collecting and using private information, including clearly indicating the purpose, manner and scope of the collection and use of information, and obtaining the consent of the individuals. In regards of sensitive private information, the express consent shall be obtained in accordance with the requirements of ""The Private Information Security Standard"".

Banking financial institutions shall improve data security technology preventive measures to ensure that personal financial data will not be disclosed during the collection, transmission, processing, preservation, usage and other processes, and shall not illegally sell or illegally provide personal data to others. The personal data of a citizen should not be provided to other persons without the consent of the individual, except where the processing does not identify a particular individual and cannot be recovered. Where banking financial institutions conduct their business through outsourcing, they should fully review and evaluate the ability of outsourced service suppliers to protect personal financial information and use it as an important indicator for the selection of outsourced service suppliers.

To avoid disclosure and sale of customers' private information by their employees, financial institutions shall strengthen the management of employees.

The Cyber Security Law requires that operators of critical information infrastructures are responsible for: (1) setting up specific security management organs and security management leaders, as well as conducting security background checks on such managers and employees in key positions, and; (2) conducting regular network security education, technical training and skill assessment for employees.

The Private Information Security Standard requires the entities in charge of private information to provide that its legal representative or principal is the responsible person who has overall responsibility for the security of private information, including providing human, material and financial resources for private information security. Institutions that fulfill one of the following conditions shall establish full-time dedicated private information protection principals and agencies responsible for private information security work: (1) the main business involving personal information processing and having over 200 employees, or; (2) processing over 500,000 pieces of personal information, or within 12 months of the expected processing of over 500,000 pieces of personal information.

Furthermore, financial institutions shall, in the form of rules and regulations or employment contracts and agency contract terms, incorporate the protection of customers' private information into the assessment system of employees, and establish disciplinary mechanisms by means of commissions and compensation, downgrading and termination of employment contracts.

The aim is to detect unregistered schools as well as those not adhering to safety norms, officials said.

The move comes a day after two children were killed and six others injured in a wall collapse at a private school in Noida.

According to police, the school building in Salarpur was ""too old and deteriorated"" and its wall collapsed due to the impact of some construction activity that was going on ""without any official approval"" in the adjoining plot.

""Earlier we found 174 unregistered schools in the district, of which 93 were shut down immediately and 22 more were closed after imposition of Rs 1 lakh fine on each.

""We are now trying to detect more such schools which may be operating without valid permissions,"" basic sikhsha adhikari (BSA) Bal Mukund told TOI.

""Sometimes these owners reopen the unregistered schools by changing their names. So two teams with two officers and two junior staff each will do the inspection. And if we find such violators, we will lodge police complaints against them and register FIRs for illegal operation of business in the name of schools,"" he said.

""Schools will be given recognition only when they meet all educational and safety parameters,"" the BSA added.

However, Mukund also acknowledged the need for more schools in the district to cater to the educational needs of every child.

""We have 685 government schools in Gautam Budh Nagar. However, these are not enough to meet the needs of a huge migrant population. At the same time, we cannot allow safety to be compromised,"" he added."

Authorities of Bihar's education department were unaware of the regressive practice being followed at the GA Higher Secondary (Plus 2) School at Lalganj in Vaishali district so far. After the matter came to light following a recent inquiry by officials, a shocked state government ordered an inquiry on Tuesday.

While all students of the school usually come to the institute together and leave the premises together, they are made to sit in different classrooms as per their castes and religions according to a system followed for the past four years, said sources. Students from Dalit and Muslim communities are reportedly never allowed to visit other classrooms.

There are also separate sections and rooms for students belonging to Hindu and Muslim communities at the school, said sources. Similarly, separate classrooms have also been allotted for students of each class belonging to the upper castes, OBCs and Dalits. The school also uses separate attendance registers for different social groups of the students.

""An inspection of the school made it clear that such a system indeed prevails there. We are sending a detailed report to the district education officer for instructions on suitable action on the matter,"" said Arvind Kumar Tiwari, the Block Education officer (BEO) of Lalganj.

School headmistress Meena Kumari, however, claimed that the social segregation of students has been proving useful in many ways. ""This system is in place in order to facilitate a smooth educational process and also to ensure that the execution of government schemes becomes easier. There is no discrimination on the basis of caste or religion,"" she said.

""There have been no negative effects of this system at the school so far. Besides, there has never been a complaint against this system, which is running smoothly,"" argued the headmistress.

Bihar education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma expressed shock upon learning of the segregation of students along caste and religious lines at a government-run school.

""It is very unfortunate if it is really happening. I have ordered a thorough investigation of the matter. Appropriate disciplinary action will be taken against whoever is found responsible for it,"" he added."

The success of any task or activity depends upon the quality of preplanning and whether accomplish or not the objective must be attempted to solidify. To start with a strong monitoring mechanism is imminent in the School level and a rational commitment is needed from all the stakeholders. In my 20 years of continuous selfless attachment in Service Association work like ANSTA & NSEAOA what I personally observed is a logical working system is in the offing particularly management policies at all level and emphatically requires more inputs on academic interest. And to achieve its goal a tangible policy is impending to formulate through the blessing of political will to improvise its traditional tag. In this regard I would like to lay down the following humble suggestions as a measures for improvement of academic acceleration towards qualitative education in the department.

1. Teachers Registry may be installed digitally so as to maintain the actual position of the required Teachers in the GPS, GMS, GHS across the State to balance the staffing pattern and also to check the excess and shortage Teachers in the School. While it can also help in reckoning the actual vacancies caused to be filled up without any discrepancies.

2. Teachers Code with a Working Gown or Working Identity Card may be introduced to Teachers for public recognition in honoring as Professionals. And by doing so it will incline to prevent from manipulative practices of keeping proxy Teacher in the School.

3. Teachers recruitment policy may be taken up on regular basis or conduct at least twice in a year to avoid all sorts of frequent agitation/strikes for want of backlog service regularization which is endless that hampers the daily classroom routine time and again.

4. Primary Education is the backbone of a child's foundation and this basic education must be prioritized by evolving an academic viable policy more of creativity and play way methods of child centered approach to bring about quality education. And it requires a major amalgamation in this sector to carry forward an effective and sustainable teaching learning process which can enable the child to pursue higher education at all level because that is the gate way of building the child's educational future career.

5. An Academic Cell for Primary and Elementary Education may be separately function in the Directorate and promote supervision and monitoring the academic performance of the GPS and GMS in particular. As it is the fundamental basis which can excel in Secondary and Higher Secondary Education ie, HSLC/HSSLC results and therefore more weightage can be given at this stage of primary and elementary targeting to minimize or eliminate the nil result Schools in public exams instead of blaming one another.

6. Regular School inspection with a feed back by the Inspecting Officer may be taken up as a tool for immediate measures towards academic improvement besides cleaning up all

Kinds of unwanted prevalent practices like sharing salaries, Teachers absenteeism, false enrolment of the School etc. While that may lead to minimize the worries and burden of Unions/ NGOs to do the checking indeed this responsibility is being vested to the department officers to carry out periodically.

7. Regular DPC may be held for timely promotion to fill up all the resultant vacancies of Asst. Headmaster, Headmaster at the School level and JEO, SDEO, DEO, the field officers in the Sub. Divisional / District level to upkeep the continuity of coordinating in managing their establishment courteously because these are correlated functionaries as far as administrative aspects are concerned.

8. Teachers Award may be streamlined by giving responsibility to the Heads of the School to identify only deserving genuine Teachers and not by the individual Teachers concerned to initiate by himself/ herself to be awarded. The number of State Teachers Award may be fixed and distributed to all the District on quota wise to do justice to all teaching community in the State. Besides due facilities be accorded and their services can be fully utilized as an outstanding meritorious Teachers in the department.

9. As far as possible Teachers training can be of an oriented motivational teaching learning skill and preferably during vacation so as not to disturb the regular classes.

10. The different formats related to State School Employees bio data/ particulars may be limited to only one and formulate as Unified School Education Format (USEF) inclusive of all expected requirements to fill in such as Staff position, Students enrolment and other physical related matters like building, classrooms, offices, furniture's, fencing, toilets, safe drinking water etc enabling for accessibility use by DoSE, NBSE, SCERT through data base to do away filling of numerous School formats.

11. Instead of opening new Schools the existing Schools may be standardized both in the academic performance and infrastructural facilities to really experience the quality education in the state with the available resources.

12. The Government may plan for observance of Year of Academic Excellence for School Education Department."

Public demand and environmental concerns associated with use of toxic pesticides and insecticides for managements of pests, such as termites, have led to development of sustainable alternatives such as ""semiochemicals"" - a novel discovery of chemical ecology.

Semiochemicals currently seek extensive adoption in pest management as sex pheromones, thereby attracting more and more termite control services providers to inculcate the technique. Relative specificity, low toxicity and greater potency of semiochemicals are key attributes that have proliferated their demand in termite control services, as eco-friendly alternatives to pesticides and insecticides. Currently, semiochemicals-based termite control services are offered as pheromone lures and traps for monitoring reasons, meanwhile being leveraged for the development of mating disruption techniques.

Termite control services market is highly fragmented with presence of a large number of local and regional players who hold sway in a particular state or city. Established players in the termite control services market are in constant seek for entering into strategic partnerships or merger & acquisition activities with the regional competitors, to capitalize on their service-specific offerings, thereby expanding their customer base and global footprint alike.

Atlanta-based Arrow Exterminators recently announced its merger and acquisition of the Knockout Pest & Termite, which would strengthen its presence in Southern Alabama's commercial & residential pest and termite control services market. The acquisition provides Arrow with eight service centers of Knockout throughout the Alabama state.

Rollins has recently strengthened its position in Kansas and Oklahoma with acquisition of the Ponca City - a pest control service provider. This acquisition will offer Rollins with Ponca's P.E.S.T machine - an electrostatic duster, along with procedures and protocols.

Plunkett's Pest Control acquired Bugeaters Pest Control and L&S Termite and Pest Control, both family-owned businesses offering quality pest management services to customers. The acquisition is a perfect fit for Plunkett's, L&S and Bugeaters alike, all being full-service providers of pest management services.

Indianapolis-based Askren Termite and Pest Control recently merged with Franklin Pest Solutions. The merger will act as a boon for the latter as it will reap benefits throughout their overall network of services across Wisconsin, Kentucky, Illinois, and Indiana.

Black Diamond, in early September 2018, announced its opening of franchise location in eastern Kentucky's River Cities area, thereby expanding its service reach for both commercial and residential clients in the area.

In early August 2018, Gregory Pest Solutions acquired the Greenville-based Commander Pest Solutions, to leverage its pest control services and termite treatment technique offerings across the area.

Rentokil Steritech recently finalized a deal of acquiring The Hitmen Termite & Pest Control, which would expand its business footprint in Northern California Market. The acquisition further adds 120 fulltime Hitmen employees to Rentokil's staff.

Continuation of Adequate Termite Control Measures Essential for Curtailing Structural Damage

Determination of potency or incidence of termite damage to residential and commercial structures is not yet accurate, however the construction industry, in co-operation with the governments, continues to recommend adequate control measures to reduce structural risk & costs apropos of termite damage. For example, the Building Code of Australia necessitates structural components of new buildings to be safe from termite damage. Considerable research & development activities are being taken into broader range of efficacious alternatives to hand-spraying of insecticides and pesticides, which in turn has resulted in development of cost-effective and innovative solutions such as pre-construction termite control and use of smart pest control techniques. Additionally, changes in termite preventative measures have led to collaborative efforts between local & state government authorities and building industry associations for addressing issues related to termite damage. Introduction and compliance to new standards and methods has resulted in a widening list of effective alternative options, thereby enabling real estate developers to advice clients in selecting among a range of options as per their investment suitability.

Her death shows not much has changed","Business Insider",FALSE,"Border officials and facilities are under renewed scrutiny after 7-year-old Jakelin Caal died last week in US Customs and Border Protection custody.

The Guatemalan child died at an El Paso, Texas hospital eight hours after CBP took her into custody.According to a timeline released by CBP, agents first became aware of the girl's symptoms during a bus ride to a police station after the girl was apprehended along with a larger group of migrants.

By the time the group arrived at the station 90 minutes later, Jakelin had stopped breathing.

Border patrol officials on Friday said agents did everything they could to save the girl but that she had not had food or water for days. They added that an initial screening showed no evidence of health problems and that her father had signed a form indicating she was in good health.

The Department of Homeland Security's inspector general said Friday that it was investigating the circumstances surrounding the child's death and a DHS official said the agency's transparency practices are also under review after it took the department nearly a week to publicly announce the incident.

The renewed scrutiny into the border agencies comes after over a year of public outcry prompted by President Donald Trump's harsh immigration policies, reports of abuse and poor conditions, and a recent tear-gas-laden clash between migrants and authorities at the US border. But the incident isn't actually unprecedented.

Juarez said in a later lawsuit that she repeatedly requested medical attention for Mairee's declining condition during their time at the facility, but was only prescribed medication that didn't have any noticeable effect.

Once they were released to join family in New Jersey, Mariee was coughing, vomiting and battling a high fever. Juarez rushed her to an Edison, New Jersey hospital the day after landing in the state on March 25, where she was held for respiratory failure.

Mariee would remain there for weeks before she suffered a fatal hemorrhage on May 10.

After Mairee's death, Juarez filed a notice of claim against Eloy, Arizona, saying that ICE placed her and her daughter in a facility ""with unsafe conditions, neglectful medical care, and inadequate supervision."" The notice goes on to claim that Mairee contracted a respiratory infection that ""went woefully under-treated for nearly a month.""

Juarez's lawyers filed a claim last month for $60 million, to which the government has six months to respond before a suit can be filed.

""Having made the decision to jail small children, the US government is responsible to provide living conditions that are safe, sanitary and appropriate,"" Jones said of the negligence alleged in the case.

As officials maintain the quality of resources in their facilities, which are recorded in documents including inspection reports, the issue of overcrowding by unaccompanied minors near work and education age poses a much easier problem to solve than those associated with quality medical care and screening.The Trump administration and border officials remain at odds with outcries from lawmakers and human rights groups, as

Nielsen said on Fox News the child's death was ""just a very sad example of the dangers of this journey."" No questions about the quality of care she received were asked."

Following directions from the CM, the department had stopped the supply of cycles for the current academic year temporarily and decided to wait for the quality report. The CM had taken the decision considering complaints raised by some elected representatives about the quality of bicycles in the review meeting, and had asked the department to conduct an inquiry and stop the supply for the time being.

However, now that the preliminary report is before the department, it has decided to wait for the final report, which includes a crash test report.

The report says, ""The bicycles inspected by us at the supplier end (onsite) are satisfactory, and also destructive tests conducted for the selected bicycles is satisfactory as per standards. We will send the test reports as well as destructive crash reports shortly."" A senior official of the department said, ""This is the preliminary report, which was done during manufacturing, and we cannot consider it as the final report, as we are yet to get the crash test report.""Since 2006, the department has been supplying free bicycles to Class 8 students of government and aided schools.

Inspection at three levels

Normally, before the bicycles reach schools, the department conducts three levels of tests to ensure quality. First, during the time of production, where one among 100 samples will be checked. The second is a crash test, where one bicycle will be chosen among 2,500. The third level of quality testing is after delivery, where 40 samples from all divisions are checked randomly. As per data, 90 per cent of the bicycle distribution has been completed in the state. Of the 5.4 lakh bicycle orders, distribution of 4.11 lakh bicycles has been complete. The rest will be done after the final quality test report is received."
