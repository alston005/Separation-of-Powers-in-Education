The University Grants Commission (UGC) , the regulator of the higher education sector, has pushed ahead with the strategy of providing autonomous status to the country's better performing colleges, in an attempt to improve the quality of teaching and learning in the country's higher education institutions.

Thus far this year, it has given the autonomous status to 37 colleges, taking the total number to 672 colleges across 106 universities. To be sure, this has been UGC's long-time strategy: between 2007-08 and 2017-18, the number of autonomous colleges rose from 281 across 55 universities to 635 across 105.

According to data from UGC, the south Indian states account for a lion' s share of colleges with autonomy status. Tamil Nadu with 183 colleges leads the pack, followed by Andhra Pradesh (97), Karnataka (70) and Telangana (59).

Large states such as Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, with 11 and 5 autonomous colleges, lag behind. Interestingly, experts point out that Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan lag the southern states in various educational

indicators, perhaps suggesting a link between the presence of autonomous institutions and this.

Government officials are confident that with new guidelines for autonomous colleges issued earlier this year, more colleges from all geographical areas will now be applying for this status.

An autonomous college can review existing courses, programmes and restructure, redesign and prescribe its own courses or programmes of study and syllabi. These colleges can formulate new courses with the UGC-specified nomenclature and even evolve methods of assessment of students' performance and conduct of examinations.

However, even for these colleges, the degree is awarded by the University with the name of the college on the degree certificate.

""Nearly, 40 colleges in districts across the country were granted autonomous status in the current year by the commission. We are also planning to make the process of applying for autonomous status online and comparatively simpler. It is felt that autonomy can provide a much needed boost to academic standards,"" UGC secretary Rajnish Jain said.

Several top performing colleges have been given the autonomous college status in the course of this year, including Pune's Ferguson College, Chennai's Loyola College, L N Welingkar Institute of Management Development and Research, Mumbai and PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, a government official said on condition of anonymity.

""Even in the last commission meeting on December 10, at least eight new colleges, including SGGS Khalsa college in Patiala, were approved for the autonomous status,"" this person added.

""The idea of academic autonomy to higher education systems is a good idea. But the full benefits of academic autonomy can be reaped only if the colleges have financial support to effectively implement innovations and new academic structures. In the absence of such a support only minor tinkering with the routine academic structures are possible,"" said former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy.

India started giving colleges such status in the eighties, Kapahy pointed out. Three decades on, an in-depth review may be called for to see if these colleges have fulfilled the original promise of helping the cause of academic excellence , he added."

In an email interview with IANS, he sheds light on how the higher education system is burdened by over-regulation and why more corporates and high net worth individuals should come forward to support the government in making India a preferred global destination for pursuing higher education and research.

Q: What is ailing India's higher education system? What kind of reforms, according to you, can improve the system?

A: The Indian higher education system is over-regulated and under-governed. This is evident in recent government policies that aim to reduce regulatory oversight through initiatives such as Graded Autonomy for well-performing institutions, and the Institutions of Eminence project that will allow for selected institutions to self-regulate on key aspects such as recruitment, admissions and collaborations. However, given the gap in scale, access and relative quality of higher education in the country, further reforms are urgently needed to match the rapid expansion of the sector with performance and quality. We also need greater engagement from private actors, including from industry, to promote quality in higher education.

Q: What is stopping private universities in India from becoming world-class universities?

A: If one were to look at the parameters on which international ranking agencies such as THE (Times Higher Education), QS (Quacquarelli Symonds) and ARWU (Academic Ranking of World Universities) operate, one would notice common metrics such as research, reputation and internationalisation. Indian universities primarily focus on teaching and less on research. Secondly, functions of internationalisation (i.e. hiring of foreign faculty members, admitting foreign students and building student mobility programmes) within higher education institutions are currently over-regulated by the government. For private universities to flourish, there needs to be greater balance between government oversight, functional autonomy and a diversified funding ecosystem within the country for such institutions.

Q: How can Indian universities improve rankings in list of the world's top universities?

A: Indian universities need to prioritise research impact and outcomes. There is greater need for funding in Indian universities, which ought to come from both public and private sources. Secondly, the regulations that encumber the internationalisation efforts of universities need to be eased. Universities need to be encouraged to promote all forms of internationalisation. We need to create an ecosystem in which students from other parts of the world should desire to study in India just as we create opportunities for student mobility programmes where Indian students go abroad for various short- and long-term programmes. All of this will require greater support from the government and private actors.

Q: What measures should India put in place to improve access to higher education among the underprivileged?

A: While public universities now provide the broadest access to students from under-represented and disadvantaged communities, private higher education institutions need to play a far greater role in expanding access to quality higher education in India. The higher education sector is yet to see meaningful private participation in a not-for-profit mode where corporates and high net worth individuals support access to quality higher education. O.P. Jindal Global University is a stellar example of private, not-for-profit and corporate philanthropy in higher education. Unfortunately, for a large country like India, there are very few such examples and we need more of them.

Q: What role do you see for universities in shaping the future of the nation?

A: A nation is built on the basis of its people and, indeed, institutions. Visionaries who inspire others and change the way of doing things are critical in every effort to build a nation. In order for our citizens to dream, aspire and inspire, there needs to be greater imagination and efforts in creating enabling and inspiring environments in the form of university spaces where teaching, learning and research can happen. Institution-building is central to nation-building and that is how we can create an enabling environment for the future.

The exercise, which is expected to begin mid-November, is being led by the regulator of the higher education sector, University Grants Commission (UGC), which has already collected at least 300 state acts. A team of legal consultants working with Niti Aayog will study these acts to give a holistic picture, the official added.

UGC is already working on revising parameters for the setting up of universities. ""There have been concerns about the standard of education in the hundreds of private universities spread across the country, and also about to maintaining quality. There have been reports of varsities with insufficient infrastructure, including some functioning from just a few rooms,"" said the ministry official who asked not to be named.

It was felt that a way to address the situation was to have a comprehensive evaluation of the legislations through which these bodies are set up, the official added.

The hundreds of acts under which private universities are set up in different states will be examined in light of the latest parameters that the regulator will soon come up with, said the official. ""The idea is to identify any lacunae or gaps that lead to a laxity in the maintenance of educational standards, and ways to address them.""

He added that the ministry has taken steps to bring UGC and legal consultants together to address this key aspect following directions from HRD minister Prakash Javadekar.

""The government is in favour of granting more funds and more autonomy to institutions that provide quality education, but ensuring that standards are not diluted is a key premise. Therefore, it is believed this exercise would go a long way in addressing quality concerns,"" the official said.

Apart from this, UGC is analysing nearly 8,000 cases it finds itself embroiled in, because, officials feel, ambiguities in existing legislations could be the reason behind several of these legal matters. ""The study may help in suggesting ways in which the burden on the UGC of such cases may come down in the coming days,"" said the official quoted above.

Former UGC member Inder Mohan Kapahy said, ""Some (private universities in India) are very good and some not as good. At times, even political pressure may lead to the formation of such a body. A key aspect is: the day an act or ordinance is passed, the body can give degrees. There should be some mechanism to ensure quality checks at the time of inception. In India, operations of a varsity have hardly ever been stopped. So it is important to have quality checks at the time of inception, particularly with regard to new private varsities."""

If their proposal is accepted, HR, KC and Bombay Teachers' Training College run by the Hyderabad (Sind) National Collegiate Board (HNCB) will together be an independent university in south Mumbai. The idea is to create autonomous interdisciplinary universities and enhance quality in higher education.

The state government will send proposals for three cluster universities to the Centre under the Rashtriya Uchchatar Shikshan Abhiyaan (RUSA) scheme. The two other proposals are from the Somaiya Group that will include its three arts, science and commerce colleges in Vidyavihar and the state itself with its four SoBo colleges-Sydenham, Elphinstone, Secondary Training College and Institute of Science.

(KJ Somaiya College for Arts and Commerce, KJ Somaiya College for Science and Commerce and SK Somaiya College for Arts, Science and Commerce) and the state government itself with its four colleges in south Mumbai-Sydenham, Elphinstone, Secondary Training College and Institute of Science. The last of these was the first proposal considered for the RUSA scheme with Government Law College and without Sydenham in 2015.

A statement issued by higher and technical education minister Vinod Tawde said, ""To increase the academic quality of higher education, the state has decided to send three proposals to RUSA. It will give students more options in the rightful implementation of choice-based credit system. RUSA will facilitate the setting up of these universities.""

The decision was taken at a meeting with representatives from these colleges and their managements. Tawde clarified that existing state funding to these colleges will not be impacted. The state will have to make a legislation for cluster universities to impose some minimum norms such as NAAC accreditation, resourceful research centres and quality checks, which could take time, said an official.

RUSA's state project director, Meeta Rajiv Lochan, said students from a commerce college in the cluster can choose to do a minor in chemistry from the other constituent college offering science. ""Several interdisciplinary options can be explored. They can share costs and resources, create curriculum, courses etc. It will also give them autonomy to build international linkages. If they enhance brand value, in future, there could be scope for more colleges to get affiliated to the newer universities,"" she said.

A government official said the current batch of graduating students from Mumbai University did not learn GST as part of its curriculum as the syllabus was not updated. ""Cluster university will allow academic freedom to colleges to develop skill-based curriculum from time to time and allow horizontal mobility of students to choose courses. It will not be the same as the freedom granted to autonomous colleges, as cluster universities will have independent academic bodies of their own, with no representatives from the parent university,"" said the official.

Three to five existing colleges with adequate academic, physical and technical infrastructure can come together to form a cluster university, and the participating colleges eventually become constituent colleges of the newly-created university. Since such universities will have multiple campuses, RUSA recommends the constituent colleges to be within a radius of 15-20km to allow sharing of resources. One of the colleges will be the lead college, which will host the vice-chancellor, among other responsibilities.

The Centre had initially floated a plan to start 35 cluster universities across India. The initial scheme was to grant Rs 55 crore to each of the cluster universities to facilitate the process. Jammu and Kashmir already has a cluster university in Srinagar."

For more than 20 years, the keywords and phrases driving school education in India have been ""learning levels"", ""quality"", ""competencies"" and ""outcomes"". For almost as long, government school students have been tested to establish how they measure up, through the National Achievement Surveys and later through State Learning Achievement Surveys.

From the mid-2000s, the Aser Centre - which grew out of the educational non-profit Pratham - started conducting its annual learning achievement surveys, published in the form of the Annual Status of Education Report or Aser report. This assessment, of mostly poor, rural elementary school children, drew public attention to low learning levels in this demographic across the country.

Clearly irked by Gujarat's poor performance in the Aser surveys and unhappy with its methodology, the Gujarat government settled on a new assessment and school ratings system in 2009. It was called Gunotsav - a ""festival of quality"".

Billed as the brainchild of Narendra Modi, then the Gujarat chief minister, it was designed as an appraisal system for government-funded schools to ensure each school got what it needed in order to improve quality - from bricks and mortar to specific types of teacher training. It was meant to be a means by which schools could pinpoint their own shortcomings and find ways to fix them.

Schools are currently classified in ascending order from D to A+, based on an annual assessment of their academic performance, co-curricular activities, community participation and available infrastructure. Teachers are also graded, and at least initially only those with A or A+ grades were eligible to be nominated for teachers' awards.

Gunotsav was not meant to be a permanent feature on the school calendar, according to RP Gupta, the state's principal secretary of school education in 2009, currently at the Niti Aayog. It was just the first step towards creating the office of an independent evaluator, much like the UK's Office for Standards in Education or Ofsted, whose remit extends to teachers' education. Gupta said that a government order to that effect was passed in 2011.

Around the same time time, Pragna - the state's activity based learning programme - was also being introduced in schools. Its central premise is to allow children to learn at their own pace, moving ahead only once they have actually learnt a concept. An annual assessment militates against learning at one's own pace. But Gupta said that it was hoped that eventually all academic assessments would be ""through Pragna"", which, in ideal conditions, has a system of continuous assessment built into its step-by-step learning process.

In the first two Gunotsavs, schools reflected the middling to poor results of all the different types of surveys that had preceded it. In the third year, Gunotsav results showed an upward swing. The other surveys - albeit each using a different methodology - continued to paint a rather grim picture. Nine years after Gunotsav first started, it seems not so much has changed in Gujarat's government schools after all.

What is Gunotsav?

This is how Gunotsav works: every government and government-aided elementary school in the state assesses itself based on prescribed parameters, and on pre-specified days each year holds standardised tests for students from Classes 2 to 8. About 25% randomly selected schools in each block are subjected to a surprise assessment by an external examiner who, in theory, observes the school's activities for an entire day. This examiner can be anyone, from the chief minister or his ministers to senior civil servants and district administration and education department officials. The surprise external assessment is intended to keep school administrations on their toes and to act as a disincentive against cheating or fixing the self-assessment. Gupta said that this was to make teachers accountable.

But every current official this reporter interviewed described the process as ""instilling a sense of fear"". Fear, it turns out, is a dubious means of achieving accountability.

Gunotsav received Modi's imprimatur, and he and his entire cabinet participated as external assessors in the 2010 assessment. This was a sign of the seriousness with which the state government viewed the exercise and of the expectation that it would deliver results in the form of an improvement in the quality of education in government schools.

Indeed, in 2010, Modi said as much about Gunotsav:

""The soul of education is its quality...and that is why the state government has taken up the 'Gunotsav' campaign. This [the external assessment] could have very well been done by the teachers and the Department of Education. But to create the spirit of a high priority to this cause and to make those in the field of education feel the value of this activity, the complete strength of government machinery has been deployed.""

In the first Gunotsav in 2009, at least a third of government school students across the state scored between 0 and 3 on a 10-point scale where 10 is the highest score, in reading, writing and mathematics. The statewide average scores were 5.3 for reading, 4.9 for writing and 5.5 for mathematics. The state prescribed extra coaching for the large number of students who scored 0-3. A sample of these students were tested again three months later, and between 60% and 70% of them were found to be at the ""mainstream level"".

In 2010 Modi declared:

""...Gunotsav of the last year has brought some encouraging results. I would like to draw your attention towards a small encouraging example. 12 lakhs children were found weak during last 'Gunotsav'. Teachers took Upachaar Varg [remedial classes] for three months by allocating extra time. When these children were evaluated by the UNICEF subsequently, 85% of these children had improved and reached a satisfactory level. There are several such examples.""

But Gunotsav results available in the public domain for 2010 and 2011 show no transformative change in average test scores. What happened though was that the self-assessed test scores of schools, which in 2009 and 2010 were lower than the externally assessed scores, shot up in 2011. But the externally assessed scores did not change much.

Government officials do not mince words when they say that this sudden improvement in self-assessment scores is not justified. ""Schools just found a way to overcome their fear,"" said one official.

Yet Gunotsav was declared a success. As evidence, officials presented the huge improvement in overall school grades. Besides the D to A+ grades, the government also charts changes on a scale of 0 to 10, divided into five equal bands. From 2009 to 2011 (the only period for which statewide data is publicly available), the schools in the top two bands (scores upwards of 75%) by total scores went from 26% to 60%.

The state's School Learning Assessment Survey for 2013-'14, published in 2016, presented a different picture. The survey tested elementary school children in language and mathematics twice, over two semesters. Its results were stark. It found that more than 60% of students in government-funded schools averaged just 35%, the pass mark. The remainder averaged 50%, and less than 10% got 75%. Two districts, with somewhat higher scores than others, pulled up the state average.

According to this survey, class averages in all subjects for Classes 2 to 8 hovered between 42% and 49%. District-wise data for Classes 3 and 4 showed that only two districts, Ahmedabad Urban and Surendranagar, breached the 60% mark. In Class 8, Ahmedabad Urban was the only district with average scores of 60% plus across all subjects, apart from English.

A simple comparison cannot be made between the results of surveys that use different methodologies. For instance, test scores are only one - albeit the biggest - component of Gunotsav school grades. Yet, what the School Learning Assessment Survey underlined was that the improvements in learning that were expected to follow from Gunotsav had not materialised five years later.

Asked about the rising trend in Gunotsav school scores and the low average School Learning Assessment Survey scores, a Gujarat Council of Educational Research and Training official asserted that the learning assessment survey was methodologically sound. ""It is a scientifically done sample survey, its findings are validated and cannot be faulted,"" he said.

Gaming the assessment?

What then explained the rise in Gunotsav school grades?

Gunotsav was intended to spur improvements in education quality. But it has not quite worked out that way. It has become a sort of school league table with education blocks and districts competing annually for the largest number of A and A+ schools.

According to Gupta, the former principal secretary for school education, the competitive element was supposed to act as the spur. And it has, in a perverse way. It has spurred schools to improve their grade, without making a serious impact in their students' learning.

Principals, teachers, officials and observers in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar, Mehsana and Surendranagar districts interviewed for this report said that weeks or months of preparation went into getting a school Gunotsav-ready. Classrooms are decorated, buildings and bathrooms spruced up, even renovated if there is money to spare. Children endlessly rehearse prescribed components of the morning assembly and even the seating plan for the mid-day meal for the Gunotsav days. Students are drilled in the portion of the syllabus from which the test questions are set, using model tests and past papers, and are made to practice tests in the Gunotsav's multiple-choice format.

A sub-block level official said it was an ""all-consuming process"". ""For two months before Gunotsav, no one is willing to come for meetings,"" said the officer. ""Their response is call us later now we are busy with Gunotsav preparation.""

Of most concern to teachers is the timing of Gunotsav. Last year, it was held in January. School principals said they had ""wasted two weeks of the new semester doing the old [first semester] syllabus"" because Gunotsav questions are from that part of the syllabus which ""children have already forgotten"". They faced a similar problem the one time Gunotsav was held after the Diwali holidays as ""during the holidays children forget what they have learnt"".

Government officials interviewed, including some who have been external examiners, and even some teachers, said that there was a great deal of cheating, with teachers helping students with written tests, and marking answers to multiple choice questions themselves for weak children.

None of this is possible without the acquiescence of supervisory officials. One teacher called it ""government-style thinking - to support each other"". He elaborated: ""If a school is A or A+ everyone can rest. If a school gets B or C then the whole system is under scrutiny, all officials have to give an explanation."" It is in the interest of teachers and government officials - whose own ratings depend on school results - to ensure that schools show improvement, he said. With everyone in the local education administration gaming the system, even the external examiner was managed, he said.

But, if cheating happens on the scale suggested, Gujarat must be facing an unprecedented crisis in education. Data for total number of schools by grade has not been easily available since 2013, when Gunotsav was held after a year's gap, during which the format and type of questions were tweaked. However, a government official told this reporter that the numbers after 2015 are not very different from 2009 and 2010. While there are fewer D grade schools, the majority of schools are now graded B and a quarter or so A or A+.

In 2013, teachers' grades, published along with school grades, disappeared from sight. Teachers, a powerful constituency, were vehemently opposed to their grades being made public. They argued that the burden of Gunotsav results could not be all theirs.

The Gunotsav school grade is based on a weighted average of each school's scholastic test score (60%) and non-scholastic score (40%). A high non-scholastic score can make the difference between a C and B grade, a B and A grade or an A and A+ grade. In terms of non-scholastic areas like physical and co-curricular activities, the pressure to improve Gunotsav ratings has, to some extent, had a virtuous effect. Schools have set up science labs, libraries and kitchen gardens, and worked at getting community support for school improvement projects. But for every functioning library, laboratory or kitchen garden there are countless that are in name only. These are boxes to be ticked off on the day of Gunotsav with no one to check how things work during a regular school day.

In schools visited, this reporter cross-checked details on the ground against the Gunotsav school grades. This, along with interviews with teachers and observers, indicate that toilets that would have sparkled for the Gunotsav inspection are infested with flies on a regular day. A library with books on display during Gunotsav is usually locked up because ""there is no time"" to use it. A science laboratory during Gunotsav is just a trunk full of pristine lab equipment on other days. A school with no computers for students gets full marks for computer use because a teacher uses the internet to make teaching material. Yoga, exercise and sport in the majority of schools mean a few minutes of breathing exercises and stretches during morning assembly. A school that got 85% for community participation had stand-ins for non-existent school management committee members during Gunotsav.

An inner city Ahmedabad elementary school, which got a D during Gunotsav just five years ago, now boasts of an A+. Like inner city government schools everywhere, its students are from the poorest urban demographic - mostly children of daily-wage workers. Absenteeism on any day is between 15%-25%. The school's A+ grade was based on high scholastic and non-scholastic scores. Curiously while the students' scores in their medium of instruction were below 5 on a 10-point scale, their English scores were over 7. Asked to explain this, the principal said candidly: ""We have found strategies to improve our Gunotsav ranking, but I can say frankly that we have not yet focused on the question you have raised.""

Remedial classes in name only

Schools with a grade lower than an ""A"" are required to hold remedial classes for students whose test scores are below average. Officials complained that many schools simply do not hold them. But in some cases their students do better when they are tested again, said an official who monitors the process. Asked how this was possible, he said: ""They are very creative. For example, they show the students who were good learners as low scoring students whose learning levels have improved through remedial classes."" He said it was difficult to catch them all out.

Those who have observed Gunotsav's trajectory say that at a critical time, around 2012, when the chinks were first beginning to be noticed, Chief Minister Modi's focus shifted from the state administration to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Gunotsav was being talked of as yet another a feather in his cap, and questioning what it had actually achieved was not on the agenda. Gunotsav is not so much a celebration of quality, as it is a celebration of the idea of Gunotsav.

Nine years later, it has become an annual ritual for schools, one that they have become inured to. The idea that Gunotsav was a first step towards setting standards for schools, leading to the creation of an independent evaluator has been effectively buried. But, Gunotsav is being promoted as a successful, replicable model. Assam recently commenced its own Gunotsav and the Prime Minister's Group of Secretaries for Health and Education recommended a ""Gunotsav type"" annual assessment as part of its education reforms proposals submitted in 2016.

For a few months, no one was sure if Gunotsav would be held for the current academic year, as it was only in November that the National Assessment Survey was conducted. The Union government had touted this survey as the survey to end all surveys. Clearly, it was not. The latest edition of Gunotsav started on April 6, with Chief Minister Vijay Rupani reviewing the performance of a few students in Vadodara.

Asked if the 2018 edition of Gunotsav would be different from previous years, a district education official cheerily replied, ""unlikely"".

Tripura University Vice-Chancellor Anjan Kumar Ghosh said in many countries such teachers and teaching scheme does not exist.

""To improve the quality of teaching, the new scheme would be a great instrument,"" the Vice-Chancellor added.

The University Registrar Sanit Deb Roy also spoke in the function.

The scheme's goals included setting up, among other things, 30 schools, five centres of excellence for curriculum and pedagogy, two Inter-University Centres for Teacher Education, 25 teaching learning centres and five centres of excellence in science and mathematics.

The quality of pedagogy is perhaps the most important factor determining the quality of education. So, it is quite bewildering that the University Grants Commission (UGC) doesn't only propose that a potential college teacher's graduation scores be given nearly the same weightage as her doctoral degree -- the maximum weightage assigned for graduation score is 21% while it is 20% for PhD -- but also is willing to let assistant professors take on doctoral students. Earlier, only associate professor-or-senior level university teachers were supposed to guide doctoral scholars. Post-graduation scores have been assigned 33% weightage Given the doctoral degree best demonstrates both research competence and area of specialisation, the UGC draft regulations are decidedly odd. This, when it is for the first time that graduation scores are being considered for teachers' recruitment. The problem with prioritising a graduate degree over PhD is that many scholars whose research could help improve the quality of pedagogy could be passed over.

World rankings of higher education institutes/universities already feature just a handful of Indian universities/institutes, and that too at relatively unimpressive ranks. Diluting teachers' standards will only worsen the problem. At the same time, the new draft regulations also make a PhD mandatory for a college teacher to be promoted to assistant professor (Selection Grade/Academic Level 12) after July 2020 -- a PhD will be mandatory for university level teachers even at the entry level. However, the time consumed by a college-teaching recruit to complete her PhD will not be considered as teaching/ research experience to be claimed for appointment to a senior teaching position. With the first year of PhD being full-time course work, it is difficult to see how recruits can juggle teaching responsibilities while working on their doctoral research. For yoga and the fine arts, no formal qualification is required to appear for the interview."
