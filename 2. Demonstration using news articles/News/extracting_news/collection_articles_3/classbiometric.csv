Ganta Srinivas Rao, Andhra Pradesh Human Resources Development Minister, has mandated all the universities' Vice Chancellors to arrange meetings every three months to address the academic and administrative issues pending with them, as reported by Hans India.

Rao demanded that the officials fill all vacancies speedily to compete with private universities. Most importantly he directed that the biometric system should be introduced to monitor student and staff attendance regularly. He also said that placement cells in all universities will be opened soon.

Biometric attendance was only being followed by those colleges affiliated to JNTU-H, and not by colleges affiliated to Osmania University and Kakatiya University said the Telangana Engineering College Management Association.

Mr Sharan Raichur, President of Telangana Joint Action Committee, alleged that the attendance system was deliberately not being implemented by colleges so that they could collect attendance fees later on. He also conceded that the students were not interested in the classes because of the faulty faculty as reported by Deccan Chronicle.

Association president Mr Goutham Rao reiterated that there should be a uniform policy and all universities should implement the biometric system."
