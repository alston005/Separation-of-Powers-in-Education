AMID FEAR of protests by teachers on contract, police in Jharkhand's Palamu have banned the use of black clothes by those attending a function scheduled to be attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the district on January 5.

The order, issued by Palamu SP Indrajit Mahatha on December 29, covers the use of shawls, trousers, shirts, coats, sweaters, mufflers, socks, ties, bags and shoes at the function. Sources said that after the SP's order drew criticism, police have decided that black shoes would be allowed.

The SP's order to deputy commissioners in Latehar, Garhwa, Chatra and Palamu, states: ""...PM is scheduled to travel to district on 5 January. Those who are coming to attend PM function should be instructed in advance not to wear black dress to the function venue and everyone must carry their identity cards.""

Sources said the order was issued to avoid protests by contract teachers, who had waved black flags at Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das during a function in Ranchi last month. The protesters were demanding regularisation of jobs and pay parity with government teachers.

""We have to take care of the dignity of guests...There will be no restriction on black shoes though,"" SP Mahatha said.

""We have held meetings with functionaries of some teachers' associations, who have assured us that they will not hold any protest at the PM function,"" another officer said."

The resolution also ""defined"" ""Urban Maoists"" as those ""who are not the same Maoists fighting for armed revolution in jungles but people who are very much around us, providing intellectual strength to this fake idea of revolution"".

""They work in the disguise of so called intellectuals, academicians, artists and civil society activists in their NGOs. The strategy of Urban Maoists is to use the resources of the state against the state,"" it added.

""There is a need to stop writers and academicians who are trying to divide the country on the basis of religion, language and caste by commenting on national integration its culture and values. Also, all those who have legal cases against them or have been sentenced, these persons should be banned from visiting campuses and debarred from delivering lectures as faculty in all the educational and training institutes,"" said ABVP's national general secretary Ashish Chauhan.

Meanwhile, in another resolution, the ABVP demanded that the process of appointment of regular teachers on vacant posts should be started immediately, adding that short-term ad hoc and contract-based appointments were atrocities to the long term vision of cosmopolitan education.

The students' outfit also criticised the semester system, claiming that these are the demands that have been received by maximum number of students. ""We will strongly take up these issues with universities and state governments. If needed, we will protest and also sit on dharna against the semester system in states like Gujarat.

Chauhan demanded that consideration of semester system as a standard system by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and mandatory implementation of this semester system in colleges with lack of infrastructure makes it a compulsion and binding should be removed."

The professors said that it is an injustice to them as the difference in pay scale between the two commissions is around Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000.

Moreover, even though they are ad hoc (temporary basis) professors, the workload is equal to that of permanent staff and only the pay scale and additional security differs.

""This is victimisation of our professors. Just because we are on a temporary basis, does not give them (the university) the liberty to exploit us in anyway,"" said a professor on the condition of anonymity.

Meanwhile, another professor, who is serving as an assistant professor at a Churchgate-based college, said, ""Currently, I am being paid around Rs 45,000 while as per the state's clause of the sixth pay commission I should be getting more than Rs 62,000. Adding to this, there is no security provision for us either from the university or college.""

Recently, the state government approved the seventh pay commission where the salaries and related allowances of state staffers including teachers and professors were cleared.

The state government had earmarked a sum of Rs 10,000 crore in the state budget for 2018-2019 to revise the pay scales of the employees.

""While we should be getting salaries now as per the seventh pay commission, we are still stuck with salaries as per the fifth pay commission. We have a family but more importantly, we have self-respect. When I contact my friends from other universities in other parts of the state, they are all getting salaries higher than what we have been getting till now,"" said another professor.

A good number of ad hoc professors are in every department and sub-campus of the university.

""The only drawback apart from the personal problems we face is the lack of motivation we professors struggle with on a daily basis. There are several professors in our department who are on permanent posts who have the same level of job but the provisions and salaries they receive are way better than us,"" he added.

Ad hoc professors are on a contract basis. While recruiting them, they are given a dedicated slot till such time they can work in that position. Several professors have written to both the university and the state government to look into this matter."

Earlier, the senior teachers had submitted a memorandum to former VCs to extend their retirement age from 60 to 65. Sources, however, indicated the varsity would fix the retirement age at 60. A university order, sent to 29 UIT centres in the state earlier this year, specified that engagement of staff on contract basis is not permitted after the age of 60 years and hence asked principals of UIT centres not to forward the engagement requests of staff above the age of 60. The rule also applies to those who are completing the age of 60 during the contract ending period in March 2019. The order has many senuior teachers worried.

""Since we have no pension, we will be left high and dry without any income after retirement. However, if the university proceeds with that action, we have only one demand. UIT principals' retirement age is 65. So we request the university to hike the age limit to 65 for all teaching staff,"" said Sreekumar (name changed), a senior teaching staff.

At present, the UITs have both contract and guest lecturers in service. The principals of the centres are the retired professors from government educational institution. Of 29 centres, many teaching staffs fear they might lose the job if the university failed to extend the retirement day.

According to M Lenil Lal, former University Syndicate member, there were differences of opinion in the former syndicate over raising the retirement age of senior staffs of UITs and a final call on this would be made in January. ""We did discuss this issue in many syndicate meetings. But there was no consensus. Some members wanted to raise the age of teaching staff while some wanted to appoint young teachers to give them the opportunity. So we have not decided yet on this and our priority would be to raise this issue in the first syndicate meeting to be held in January. We hope that the issue gets resolved in January itself,"" he said.

Most of the teachers in UITs are highly qualified and took up their job in the hope that sooner or later their service would be regularised. Meanwhile, University of Kerala vice-chancellor V P Mahadevan Pillai told Express the matter has not been brought to his attention. ""I am unaware of this issue as it has not been brought to my attention. So I am not authorised to comment now,"" said Pillai.

Then he threatened them with expulsion, a criminal probe and being blacklisted from all Russian universities.

Their crime? Setting up an independent student union.

But Shaidurov and Dautov, children of the social media era, did not take the threats lying down. Instead, they went public about their altercation with the principal last month. The student union's ranks swelled and education authorities in St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city, came out in support of the teenagers, not the principal.

Many other young Russians have had their first taste of political activism in street protests against corruption and the banning of rap music, protesting the authoritarian status quo that their parents have unhappily gotten used to.

Russian teenagers putting up a social media fight against the rigid, Soviet-like attitudes of some teachers was one of Russia's political highlights of the year.

Shaidurov and Dautov came up with the idea after reading about Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx and the U.S. trade union movement. They realised that their own problems strict and unnecessary testing, dress code restrictions had resonated elsewhere and would make a rallying cause for a student union.

""At first, everyone was laughing at Leonid and me, because it was just the two of us,"" says Dautov, who wears multiple rings and a ""Revolutionary Workers Party"" badge on his scarf.

Two separate groups of the new student union held their first meetings in mid-November at a soccer field near the sprawling concrete school.

Shaidurov, who led both meetings, was summoned to the principal and told he had organized an ""unsanctioned rally"" that would be investigated by prosecutors. His and Dautov's parents were later hauled over the coals.

Later on, police officers visited the school to conduct ""a preventive discussion"" to warn the students about the dangers of staging unsanctioned rallies and extremism, a widely defined term that Russian authorities have used to go after dissenters of all stripes.

At the next parent-teacher meeting, parents were told that their children had joined an ""extremist organization"" and would be blacklisted from entering college, according to Shaidurov's mother, Yelena, who teaches history at the school.

She mounted a social media campaign. Prosecutors went to check the school and found that the girl's rights were violated.

Later, the Perm education department banned schools from strict dress code rules.

In Komsomolsk-on-Amur in Russia's Far East, a teacher has been suspended after a video of her pushing a teenager onto the ground and spanking him was posted online. Investigators have opened a criminal case.

Alexander Kondrashev, a teacher from St. Petersburg who belongs to an independent teachers' union, says the power dynamics between Putin-era teenagers and predominantly Soviet-educated teachers is starkly different from a generation earlier.

""It's much harder for a teacher to control the situation with children these days,"" he said. ""First, children have a clearer idea of their rights and they are ready to stand up for them. And second, audio and video recordings have given them a significant information clout.""

""It's weird, because you can be sent to prison and contract TB at 14, but you can drink and smoke and express yourself fully only when you're 18,"" Dautov says.

The system that Shaidurov and Dautov have been fighting against replicates the Russian government power structure in miniature.

The principal is answerable only to superiors in the education ministry while the students do not have much say in decision-making at school. Shaidurov and Dautov's school has its own student body but it works hand in hand with the administration and lacks any powers.

""We even have a newspaper and a YouTube channel allegedly for students which is dead and no one watches it,"" Dautov says, scoffing at the fact that instead of discussing real issues that students face, from high workloads to image pressures, the existing body debates ""what kind of Christmas tree to put up.

Her first book came out of a her popular blog, Compulsive Confessions, and there was no looking back since then. She has to her credit more than five books and her latest book, The One Who Had Two Lives, is the second book in her Girls Of The Mahabharata series. Excerpts from an interview with CE:

What was your trigger for writing Girls Of The Mahabharata: The One Who Had Two Lives?

I've loved writing about young women. I don't think the concerns of women change much, whether they were born in 1500 BC or 2000 AD. I imagine the larger questions are the same: Who will love me? What shall I do with my life? Why do I want different things from my parents? When I began writing the Girls Of The Mahabharata series (starting with Satyavati) I imagined each book would offer an accurate reflection of that specific character's life -- orphaned Satyavati or oldest sister Amba or transman Shikhandi.

I also started to think a lot about gender and sexuality. The lines are blurred in this book, so everything's very fluid. I have two trans characters, two deep friendships and easy interactions around sexuality. I think in India's Vedic times we were a lot less concerned about who slept with whom than we are today.

Have you always seen yourself as a writer?

Yes! I used to have these notebooks which I carried to school -- separate from school work -- and if I was getting very bored in class I'd invent stories and write them down. I was very interested in the different forms of storytelling. I remember at age eight, I realised I could record my voice onto our old tape deck and then I invented this whole family and narrated their lives. It was sort of like a radio play. By about age sixteen, after thinking of a number of careers -- veterinarian mainly -- I realised I couldn't fight it any more, I was going to be a writer.

What has been your inspiration as a writer?

The books I read, the music I listen to, the conversations I have with other people. I'll be making idle chit-chat and then something will go ""ping!"" inside my head and it'll settle into my next book. I write a lot as well. I send out a mostly weekly newsletter, filled with updates about my life. I tweet, I write articles, I take photos and add long captions, it's all practise towards my larger body of work.

Does your writing draw influence from vernacular books?

I'm, unfortunately, almost entirely monolingual. My spoken Hindi is not bad, having grown up in Delhi, and I can understand a smattering of Telugu because I spoke it in my early years, but absolutely no Malayalam or any other Indian languages. As a result, I read only in English -- and vernacular books in translation.

With the digitisation of books, have you moved to reading books on screen or do you prefer the old-fashioned books?

Books are books. I have an extensive personal library which I love, filled with ""real"" books, and I have a Kindle which I also love. When I'm travelling, my Kindle is my lifesaver, but when I'm in Delhi, I love to curl up with a book.

What is the process you undergo while writing?

I try to stick to word count goals daily -- usually about 1,500 words -- and a lot of my writing gets done between 4pm and 7pm. I like having music on in the background, something instrumental, jazzy or ambient. The rest is mostly random, what sort of day I'm having (I try not to schedule lunch dates because then I'm too mentally tired by 4pm to do anything), or whether I have freelance deadlines which also eat into a fraction of my writing day. When I do get started, I can go pretty fast, because I've been thinking of my book inside my head.

How difficult or easy is it to get published? Have you had to modify or change the content of your book for it to get published?

I first got published ten years ago, so a lot of things have changed since then. For me, I got my first book contract because of my blog, which was popular then, and since that book did well, I've been quite lucky to find publishers again.

With one of my young adult books, then called Confessions of a Listmaniac (republished as The Life and Times of Layla the Ordinary) I was told to change a scene where the character had a hangover, and another one where a couple is making out, so it would fly past the teachers who checked for these things. But when Penguin picked it up, I got to put the chapters back the way they were. I remember being a teenager and how all those things were very real to us.

Who's your first reader? And who are your biggest critics?

My first reader is my husband, who offers great feedback each time. As for my biggest critics, I know I have loads on the internet, sometimes I stumble upon a bunch of them discussing my books and how terrible they are. Maybe I'm hiding from them because they have left me alone for the last couple of years.

Do you think marketing plays an integral role in the success of a book?

All writers have to be excellent salespeople these days as well. Sure, some books will surprise you by slipping through the net and doing amazingly well just by word-of-mouth, but I can guarantee that all the books you're seeing are all visible to you because of a marketing campaign."

Teachers headed for battle with 'undemocratic' VC

The administrative regime is simply following the government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is anti-democratic in its imagination and punitive in approach.

Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) is now in a new phase of life. Known as 'comply or perish' to us insiders, not a day passes without the administration issuing some circular demanding ""compliance"" from the faculty or students of the university.

Since most of these demands range from the absurd to the counterproductive, like enforcing students and faculty attendance or arbitrarily rescheduling the academic calendar, most do not comply. Often the faculty, after protracted discussions in the general body meetings of the teachers association, resorts to different modes of protesting this compliance enforcement raj. These protests are then promptly followed by threats and punitive action meant to ""discipline"" the 'non-compliant' - much in the fashion of bullies and thugs. These range from petty and vindictive methods - like docking leave and not processing medical papers - to issuing legal instruments like show-cause notices.

Legal threats are usually issued to just a few, perhaps with the aim of frightening the many. More importantly, issuing more than 150 notices at any given time also exposes the well-known fact that most in the university are opposed to the administration and find laughable the constant threat of disciplinary action against those who refuse to cow down. Those not in JNU or any other university in the country do not immediately understand what is being undertaken here.

Some even wonder why the JNU faculty and students seem to continuously be in protest mode. There are two ways of responding to this. Let's begin with the counterfactual.

Why did the university not witness this kind of anti-administration protest prior to February 2016? The answer is simple: because such anti-academic and anti-university measures had never been attempted by the administration prior to 2016. The present VC and his administrative coterie are not simply undoing every functioning structure of JNU, they are vandalising the idea of the university.

Here, the second reason to understand JNU's protests becomes important. The faculty has consistently stated that the changes being made to the university's structure are not only unnecessary, but also in repeated violation of ordinances and the very Act of parliament that created it. The ongoing protests demonstrate the present administration's consummate disregard for democratic procedures and well-established conventions, which is deeply injurious to every aspect of the university.

Why are the demands - be it marking of daily attendance (soon to be biometric) or online entrance examinations, followed by threats and punishments exemplifying the worst kinds of managerial practices?

The answer, once again, is obvious. Privatising a public university requires that its very character be changed completely. JNU was created as a research university in 1970, and has always maintained a very special character. It has provided a very high standard of higher education to students from different regions of India, belonging to any social or economic strata, at minimal cost.

The decades following its creation saw at least two kinds of developments in the university. One was a very high quality of research output, both of the faculty and of young researchers. This also helped in creating many generations of teachers who are presently employed in colleges and universities in India and abroad.

The other was an organic emergence of an extraordinary university culture that synthesised the intellectual and the political - enabling students not only to find their feet as scholars, but also articulate their selfhood as citizens. Students in JNU have historically debated everything from American imperialism, the many failures of the Indian state, to what the university itself ought to be.

The ability to knit this criticality into the very fibre of the university, by creating a space for student engagement in institutional processes (through department level student-faculty committees, or students union representation in boards of study or the Academic Council meetings), is what made JNU a truly democratic university.

The new tightly-managed and privatised university will not have space for any of this. We can already get glimpses of this in numerous such universities that have mushroomed all over the country. At the outset, they have a prohibitive fee structure that will keep out hundreds of brilliant, though poor and marginalised students, for whom higher education will become unaffordable.

Even ordinary middle class families will not be able to afford such an education. Besides, many new private universities have a biometric attendance system in place; they also do not permit any of its members - faculty, students or the non-teaching staff - to form unions. Contract structures are also beginning to reflect how the private is different from the public - at its most worrying, differential pay scales are being put in place - which will eventually create salary-driven divisions between colleagues appointed at the same level. This will also occur between Indians and non-Indian faculty.

The carrot usually dangled in front of the faculty is that they will have the space to create their own courses. For those of us quite used to doing so for decades in a public university like JNU, the stick that accompanies this privilege seems more like a police baton.

Inherent violence in government-led privatisation of public resources

The present administrative regime is simply following the current government's policy of rampant privatisation of public resources. Such a process is perforce managerial and anti-democratic in its imagination. The JNU instance makes clear that compliance enforcement and punitive measures are knitted into its very approach.

The only unexpected element in this is how JNU's university community - its students and faculty - have resisted all attempts at this wanton destruction of a nationally important public institution. They have not succumbed to the management's speak of becoming ""stakeholders""; they know what the stakes are, and continue to fight back as a community of scholars.

The battle for JNU's survival matters not only to those who work or study there - it has grave implications for the intellectual and political future of the country. Public higher education is a democratic right of all Indians. It is precisely for this reason that all who care about India's future, and wish to make it safe from ugly corporatisation or bigoted cultural agendas, must fight for the survival of the public university."

However, a closer look at the new conditions in fine print reveals that the part-time teachers may not be able to earn the assured sum even in entire year.

As per the GR issued by department of higher and technical education on November 14, the colleges and universities compulsorily need to follow a lengthy procedure to decide number of part-timers they require before appointing them. The new system has held up appointments for this year and is likely to disrupt teaching activity next year too.

Going by the GR, colleges and universities won't be able to assign work to part-time teachers before February. The university exam would start from February 15, thus leaving 15 lectures in 2018-19 session, experts say.

Earlier, the universities and colleges had the liberty to appoint CHB teachers in July itself and get approval by December from the department. Henceforth, the appointments can't be finalized until the government and universities okay the workload, which is decided only at September end when admissions close.

This year, colleges under Nagpur University (NU) as well as other parts of the state have been unable to recruit part-time teachers even though the second term of academic year has begun because of the draconian rules.

Surprisingly, several principals and aspirants have been unable to decipher the details of the GR which would entail months of unemployment and classes without teachers.

""People are so happy about the hike in remuneration that they didn't realize its drawbacks. The government is working against the interest of the students and teachers,' said Rajendra Bhoyar, president of Maharashtra Principals' Forum.

The biggest setback for teachers is restriction on working part-time in more than one college besides possessing higher qualification not less the PhD, NET/SET.

""This is injustice to teachers in the name of increasing the pay,"" said Anil Dhage, former secretary of NUTA.

He added that the GR restricts the number of lectures for a part-time teacher to 9. Earlier it was 7 but teachers were allowed to work in any number of colleges.

Bhoyar said imposing such norms not only increases unemployment among youth but also leaves students without teachers. ""At several colleges, no classes have been held so far. We have demanded that instead the government allows us to recruit contractual teachers just like the Nagpur University has done. We are ready to pay Rs25,000 a month to contract teachers,"" he said."

In June, Deepak Malghan, an associate professor with the Centre for Public Policy at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, made an unusual appeal to the institute's placement committee and environment club. The email - part request, part withering criticism - asked them to ""disinvite"" Hindustan Unilever from the job placements for management students in October.

In 2001, a thermometer factory owned by the corporation in Kodaikanal had dumped toxic mercury in the local environment of the popular Tamil Nadu tourist spot. The factory was subsequently shut. Earlier this year, activists alleged that the company's trial remediation of soil contaminated by mercury at the site in November 2017 had failed, possibly mobilising more mercury into the environment that it had recovered because it deployed a substandard process. They say that the company has refused to apply the standards follows in the United States. Hindustan Unilever has denied these claims.

The email was part of Malghan's larger mission to remind the Indian Institutes of Management, which are among the country's top business schools, of their responsibilities as public institutions even though they sit close to private business interests and influence. These institutes became degree-granting institutions with the passage of the Indian Institutes of Management Act in 2017.

""Disinviting them...will send out a powerful message that management institutions can actually walk the talk about corporate responsibility,"" Malghan wrote in his email. ""Disinviting Unilever from placements requires us to act like we are a real place of higher learning - with real students and professors in a classroom rather than customers and service providers. It requires us to act like a real university would - not like a glorified placement agency masquerading as a place of higher learning.""

Malghan's email elicited a ""censure order"" from the director of the institute on October 17 asking him to retract it. The note said Malghan must ""develop greater sensitivity"" towards colleagues and ""institutional stakeholders both internal and external"". Malghan retracted his letter on November 28 but ""under protest"" and after appealing to the board of governors. ""Thinking through the complex intersections between corporations, society, state, market, and the biophysical environment is an important learning objective for budding managers,"" he wrote. The retraction was shared with over 1,000 students. A week later, both the retraction and the original email became public.

This was not Malghan's first attempt to remind an Indian Institute of Management that it is a public institution. In 2017, he and doctoral student Siddharth Joshi co-authored a paper and a number of articles on the negligible social diversity among faculty members in the Indian Institutes of Management, arguing for affirmative action in the doctoral programmes that serve as a ""talent pool"" for faculty recruitment.

In the paper, Malghan had also criticised the culture of the Indian Institutes of Management to pay faculty members extra for a range of activities - such as conducting admission interviews - that in any other public university are standard academic functions teachers are expected to perform. The Indian Institutes of Management call such payments ""incentives"", but Malghan calls them ""bribes"". He has been unsuccessfully filing queries under the Right to Information Act, 2005, to obtain compensation structures of faculty of the Indian Institutes of Management.

In 2015, Malghan became the first ecological economist - studying the ""intersections between the human economy and the biophysical system that contains and sustains it"" - to win the VKRV Rao Prize, a top award for social scientists under 45. He has taught at the Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore, his first faculty position, for nine years. He spoke to Scroll.in about the role of these institutes as public institutions, the response to his criticisms and what the institutes must do to arrest their decline into the role of a ""customer service provider"".

""Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists,"" Malghan said.

Edited excerpts follow:

Is there space for this form of activism in the IIMs? All professional education institutions seem to discourage it.

The short answer is that the limited space that exists is rapidly shrinking. My specific censure order is only symptomatic of much deeper structural problems. A more important question is should there be space for this form of activism, rather than is there space. The answer to this normative question is self-evident. What is a university that does not allow a free and open exchange of ideas? IIMs pride themselves as being crucibles for thought leaders - one of those vacuous terms that has its antecedents in the public relations industry. I think it is not the university's job to train shills for the elite. A university's mission ought to be to foster thoughtful individuals including voices of dissent.

Had you written about IIM policies before the paper you co-authored on faculty diversity? What prompted you to look at the IIMs?

My collaborative work with Siddharth [Joshi] is indeed the first time I have written publicly about IIM policies. The initial impetus for our work came from the fact that anecdotally everybody in the IIM system knew that IIMs have long been guilty of an unconscionable neglect of questions of diversity and inclusion in our doctoral programmes. The dubious methods used by IIMs to skirt constitutional and statutory mandates surrounding affirmative action were well-known internally. Like a lot of other contemporary Indian institutions, IIMs are an almost exclusively upper caste, and also mostly an urban upper class preserve. Based on imperfect data, we conservatively estimate that about 95% of all IIM faculty members are drawn from upper caste Hindu groups. Out of over 640 faculty members across 13 older IIMs, there are four faculty members from the SC [Scheduled Castes] groups and only one from ST [Scheduled Tribes] groups. The social composition of faculty at IIMs might as well have been produced by an apartheid regime.

Much of the credit for beginning this difficult conversation must go to Siddharth. Besides being a first-rate scholar, he is also a committed rights activist. I am a faculty member with tenure and really had little to lose materially. Siddharth was a graduate student yet to defend his dissertation when he first started work on the IIM social diversity project. Siddharth bravely withstood a variety of attacks and derision.

What was the response to the paper?

Initial reactions were predictable - when you are accustomed to privilege, any conversation on equity feels like oppression. As a sympathetic colleague pointed out, there was deflection. There was obfuscation. There was trivialisation. There were concerted attacks from colleagues ganging up. Finally, there was some personal vilification, too. Siddharth and I were largely able to tune out the negativity because there were a bunch of incredible colleagues and students across different IIMs who supported us in more ways that I can recount here.

Some among the IIM alumni have supported the sort of reform you have written about. Are there other faculty members who share your views?

I have to set the record right here. IIM alumni have not issued statements in support of the reforms that Siddharth and I have written about. If anything, we have reacted to enlightened alumni articulating the critical need for faculty social diversity at IIMs. If you have seen some limited reforms at most IIMs (except IIM Ahmedabad), the entirety of the credit must go to the global alumni network that has tried to remind us about Ambedkar's vision for the republic. The alumni have been at the vanguard of marginal changes (but revolutionary by IIM standards) that you have seen sweep the IIM system in the last couple of years

Siddharth and I have received some very important support from faculty members across IIMs. From over a dozen faculty colleagues that have openly supported us, I must single out Professor Mira Bakhru, a former faculty member at IIM Bangalore. Professor Bakhru was the first faculty member to write about social diversity deficit at IIMs. Many faculty colleagues around the country, across different IIMs have worked hard in the last two years to think through operationalising meaningful affirmative action in the doctoral programmes at IIMs.

What effect does this lack of diversity have on teaching, research and students?

The most important diversity that must be treasured by a university is intellectual diversity. I do not wish to suggest that intellectual diversity is somehow correlated with social diversity (ethnicity, gender, etc). However, there is strong evidence that a diverse faculty and student body with varied life experiences are crucial to the educational mission of a modern university. Actually, the IIM leadership recognises how diversity contributes to better outcomes for students and faculty alike. It is only that not all diversity axes are created equal. For example, IIMs have made tremendous progress on the gender diversity front at all levels - MBA students, doctoral students, and most significantly faculty body. However, there has been more reluctance to extend the gains from increased gender diversity to say social group diversity. Caste is the most significant axis of social heterogeneity in India, not to mention the most pernicious axis of stratification. Unfortunately, much of the reluctance to address deep-seated caste inequities can be attributed to a wholly misguided and indefensible notion of meritocracy that smacks of entrenched privilege.

In the two-year MBA programmes, however, IIMs do admit a very socially diverse class. But students from historically underrepresented sections of India do not find role models in their classroom. I can bet that a class on infrastructure management is going to look very different if the faculty body had adequate representation of Adivasi and Dalit groups who have borne the brunt of a rapacious infrastructure industry. Instead we now have classes on infrastructure that are taught by faculty members who serve on boards of crony capitalist firms. For example, at IIM-B [Bangalore] the infrastructure management class is taught by somebody who is on the board of an Adani company.

Finally, IIMs are elite public institutions with considerable normative influence on the national discourse. It is unconscionable that elite institutions are as skewed as IIMs are in terms of their social representation. This problem is not unique to IIMs or even to public universities in general. For example, my own guess is that the social composition of elite media houses is as skewed as IIMs. Some of the duplicity surrounding affirmative action policies including reservations at IIMs stem from misconstruing affirmative action as a welfare or poverty alleviation measure. Affirmative action at elite institutions is anything but. It is about representation at the elite decision-making tables.

You point out that IIMs have demanded autonomy but not exercised it for ""critical engagement with business practices"". In which direction do you see the institutions going under the new IIM Act passed last year? The new law has granted even greater autonomy to the institutions.

Yes, egged on by a consumptive urban upper class, the IIMs have used the unprecedented autonomy granted to these institutions (even before the new Act) for largely self-aggrandisement. IIMs do not see themselves as enlightened public universities. Autonomy for IIMs has largely meant abdicating their social contract as a public university. The social diversity deficit at IIMs is only one of the most egregious symptoms of these institutions abandoning their public mission. I believe the new Act will only exacerbate this trend even though it also provides a framework to recover the public mission. The litmus test for any university is this: does it use the autonomy to promote an environment where the life of the mind is nurtured and treasured? Available evidence suggests that IIMs fall short of this ideal by quite a bit.

You have mentioned the ""powerful faculty bodies and board led by corporate honchos"" that run the IIMs. How have they - and IIM-Bangalore in particular - responded to your criticism?

Individual colleagues and many students have supported or at least defended the exercise in self-criticism. The leadership has been much more, shall I say, sceptical if not hostile. Of course, several colleagues have also been very critical and a colleague has even described me as being obnoxious and a hypocrite. In general, the intellectual culture at IIMs (and I can speak most authoritatively only about IIM-B) is not open to critical inquiry. The problem is structural. Business school academia is focused not on understanding the world but on manipulating it. IIMs really are not an exception. Business schools are the first departments on any university campus worldwide that are captured by vested interests including crony capitalists. Quite often it is the case of not being able to criticise the very hand that feeds you. When students are reduced to fee paying customers, the professoriate has to debase itself into a customer service provider guild. The only exception to this otherwise bleak picture that I have painted is the doctoral programme that has been my refuge.

Why did you describe faculty members receiving incentives for research as ""bribes""? How did your colleagues react to this?

Many of my faculty colleagues have been upset with Siddharth and I going to town with IIMs' worst kept secret - the fact that faculty members at these institutions need special incentives to write academic papers, and ""upset"" is putting it very mildly.

There are three fundamental problems. First, we have made a fundamental category error - incentives and integrity are two very different objects. The idea that you can fix what is fundamentally an integrity problem with incentives betrays a certain kind of studied illiteracy. How can a professoriate that is so confused about incentives and integrity lecture in an MBA classroom about business ethics? If faculty have to be paid to do admission interviews, we really cannot complain about MBAs that are paid those vulgar bonuses to run the casino economy.

The immediate corollary of this category error is that faculty demand to be bribed to do anything at all - from reading and writing to admission interviews and supervising master's thesis project. An improved incentive structure will do nothing to fix this fundamental flaw with our system. Unless we recognise that we cannot bribe our way into making up for our original sin - jettisoning our innate integrity - we are doomed. Yes, we need a set of shared norms but not metrics that reduce the deans at IIMs wholly into a bean counter.

Second, IIMs are a public university - at least in theory. We have (if only an implicit) social contract with the Indian republic. Our current compensation arrangements are in breach of this compact. Every major public university (including business schools at public universities) has an open and transparent faculty compensation structure. Unless we are willing to publicly defend who and what we pay ourselves, the present regime is simply illegitimate. In the past few months I have filed several RTI [Right to Information] requests at various IIMs asking them to reveal their faculty compensation structure (the generic structure) but all of them have come up with the flimsiest of reasons to deny this information.

Third, we are a faculty body that has lost any sense of proportion. At a public university, compensation structure ought to be benchmarked against the means of the larger society. We are being non-transparent about our compensation structure because we are paying ourselves incentives that are patently indefensible. We may come up with any number of excuses to pay ourselves. My favourite is the one offered by several colleagues - we need to pay ourselves because we now aspire to send our children abroad (read Western university) for undergraduate education. We are perfectly within our rights to harbour such aspirations but it is not any Indian public university's remit to pander to these aspirations.

It takes a certain kind of entitlement to believe that being on 98.4 percentile of the income distribution in our country (this is at the beginning assistant professor level) as a public university teacher means living a life of abject poverty.

How has your own experience at IIM-Bangalore been?

On the balance, my time at IIM-B has been most fulfilling. I must especially single out the superb doctoral programme at IIM-B that has provided me an opportunity collaborate with, and learn from young scholars in disciplines ranging from social anthropology to hydrology. The dozen or so doctoral projects that I have been involved with have been the most important source of intellectual sustenance at IIM-B. Doctoral programmes at IIMs operate outside the din and media glare associated with the bread-and-butter MBA programme. While much of the IIM system is focused on celebrating corporate titans of the world, I have been happy to inhabit a much less glamorous space that has produced many outstanding scholars."

"18","1022435352","2018-12-19","http://risingkashmir.com/news/fixed-term-employment","Fixed-term employment","RisingKashmir",FALSE,"Due to the changing circumstances, organizations around the world are experiencing an increased level of economic strain and the academic organizations are no exception.

These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output.

One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as contractual. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department.

This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors.

Although, these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, for example, Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc.

According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment.

It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfilment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.

It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees.

The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies.

Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker; and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees. The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand.

Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labelled these employees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfil the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements, and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labelled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment.

Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors.

But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees.

Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, for example, evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc.

Being labelled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee.

The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction.

The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly bureaucratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately.

The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach) of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees.

Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorismwas considered obsolete by 1930s and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfil their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world, we are not able to fulfil even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse.

And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanent staff members.

These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labelled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public.

When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions.

Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrolments.

These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind.

The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will be further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees.

The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers' account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paid neither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.

It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom and many of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences.

The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"".

Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to them has resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments.

Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

Teachers and other non-teaching employees of the University of Delhi on Tuesday marched in large numbers against the inaction of the government towards the concerns of the varsity community.

According to the Delhi University Teachers Association (DUTA), the government has failed to implement the seventh pay revision in totality for universities. The notification for implementation of revised allowances and pensions, consequent to the seventh pay commission, and disbursal of the required funds for its implementation are still pending, they say.

Teachers are agitated about the non-implementation of the UGC regulations, 2018 that stand to affect their service conditions including promotions and the unresolved anomalies of the sixth pay revision, including stepping-up.

Thousands of teaching and non-teaching permanent posts are vacant, while teachers and karamcharis have been working on adhoc/contract posts for many years.

The Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD) has not shown any interest in resolving the reservation roster issue.

Rajib Ray, DUTA president, has demanded the SLP against the grant of pension to the first and second category to be withdrawn. This attack on the livelihood of retired and retiring employees who have served the university for years cannot be tolerated and they must receive their pensions, the agitating employees said.

Now CM Kumaraswamy wants the people to help resolve the matter.

Bengaluru: The Karnataka government has been at loggerheads with NGO Akshaya Patra over the question of serving onion and garlic in mid-day meals, and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy is now ready to take the vexed issue to the people's court.

Speaking to ThePrint, Kumaraswamy said he was ready to open the issue for public debate, and let the people decide whether or not they want the ISKCON-run NGO's onion-and-garlic-free food served to their children.

The Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-profit organisation, is a midday meal partner of the Karnataka government in five districts -- Bengaluru, Mysuru, Ballari, Hubli and Mangaluru.

The Karnataka State Food Commission conducted a survey of government schools, and found that onion and garlic were absent from the meals served at schools where Akshaya Patra was the providing agency. The panel urged for them to be included to make meals tastier and more nutritious.

Akshaya Patra refused, owing to its belief in the Ayurvedic principle of providing 'sattvic' food -- cooked with organic, vegetarian ingredients. Onion and garlic are considered 'tamasic', that is, items that can trigger lethargy and negative emotions.

Naveena Neerada Dasa, ISKCON's head of strategic communication and projects, told ThePrint that it is Akshaya Patra's ""endeavour to promote good health and nutrition"", and that it ""will continue to follow the prescribed norms set by both the state and central government"".

The state government, meanwhile, began facing pressure from civil rights organisations like the Delhi-based Jan Swasthya Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra. They insist that Akshaya Patra has no right to decide what food has to be served, and cannot impose ""religious diktats"" on a scheme that embodies one's right to food.

The organisations have also spoken about the question of nutrition, though dieticians say onion and garlic only enhance taste -- their nutritional value can easily be replaced by nuts or fibres of different kinds.

The Union Ministry of Human Resource Development, which oversees the midday meal scheme, does not specify what items are to be provided to children, be it eggs or onion or garlic.

The ministry's guidelines merely state that a primary school child be served food which has a nutritional value of 450 calories -- 12 grams of protein, 100 grams of food grains, 20 grams of pulses, 50 grams of vegetables, 5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

For upper primary schoolchildren, the intake is supposed to be 700 calories -- 20 grams of protein, 150 grams of food grains, 30 grams of pulses, 75 grams of vegetables , 7.5 grams of oil and fat, and salt and condiments as per need.

The Karnataka government has been reluctant to cancel its contract with Akshaya Patra, since the midday meal scheme has helped increase the number of admissions in government schools.

It seems to have decided that the only way this matter can be resolved is if it is opened to public debate, rather than be coerced to take a decision based on the observations of civil rights organisations.

Kumaraswamy has now decided to seek the opinion of various stakeholders, including school teachers, headmasters, food scientists and dieticians, on whether there is an absolute need to add onion and garlic in the food that is being served.

""The question we are raising is whether it would cause any major deficiencies to children if (onion and garlic) are not added to their midday meals. We will be able to take an informed stand only after we receive adequate information on it,"" said Kumaraswamy.

""We will ask food experts, doctors and nutritionists on these aspects, and then take a decision. Let's not rush into any decision.""

While this controversy rages, officials at the Department of Primary and Secondary Education have come up with a new idea to bypass the onion-garlic question and yet enhance children's diet.

Preliminary discussions are on to add fruits to the menu, so that children can have a well-rounded meal.

Sources in the department also said the Mysuru-based Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI) has been asked to analyse the nutritional value of onion and garlic, and find if there are alternative fruits or vegetables that can provide the same nutrition."
"21","1022070264","2018-12-19","https://kashmirobserver.net/2018/opinion/infamous-contractual-38802","Infamous Contractual !","Kashmir Observer",FALSE,"Due to the changing circumstances, organizations around the world are experiencing an increased level of economic strain and the academic organizations are no exception. These organizations also employ diverse strategies that would assist in their growth practices with the minimum financial output. One of these strategies is fixed-term employment, which refers to the appointment of staff who offers services for a pre-determined period of time, depending on the arrangement made between the individual and the employer.

Similarly, the Higher Education Department have opted to make use of an alternative method of staffing, infamously known and called as CONTRACTUAL. As the cost of employing staff members on a permanent basis leads to increased costs, the appointment of these academic arrangement staff members on fixed-term employment contracts incorporates limited benefits, thereby limiting costs to the department. This option has been financially advantageous to this organization, but it has a negative impact on the job satisfaction of the employees, due to lack of job security and long-term career vision among other factors. Although these staff members play an important role in the overall functioning, success and survival of the educational institutions, their needs and levels of job satisfaction has often been ignored.

Since the nineteenth century, motivational researchers in the field of employee satisfaction have explained the importance of fulfilling the needs of employees in establishing a productive and satisfied workforce, e.g., Affect Theory by Locke, the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, the Dispositional Theory by Judge, Two-Factor theory by Herzberg, the Job Characteristic Model by Hackman and Oldman, etc. According to research that was conducted by the Harvard Professional Group (1998), job satisfaction can be seen as the sense of achievement and success that is experienced by an employee at the place of employment. It continues by stating that job satisfaction is the main ingredient that leads the employee towards the attainment of set goals such as recognition, better income structure, promotion to a better position, as well as achievement of other objectives that will ultimately lead to a higher level of motivation and fulfillment.

Experts have emphasized the hampering effect that fixed-term employment conditions may have on job satisfaction of staff and have identified underlying uncertainties and frustrations among fixed-term contract staff members and the challenge of keeping those staff members committed to their academic task.It has been found that the employees who have a permanent employment contract tend to experience a much higher level of job satisfaction than those employees with a fixed-term contract and this can have a negative influence on the motivation and productivity of these employees. The lack of formal support from the middle management, the prejudiced perceptions of permanent contract staff members, as well as the negative effect of this kind of appointment on the career paths of these staff members are some of the major reasons for individuals being shy from this type of appointment.

The rising unemployment and lack of alternatives have left no choice for the candidates in our context. The use of fixed-term employees allows flexibility to the educational institutions as the number of lecturers can be increased or decreased according to their need. But there is also rise to a number of managerial challenges on different levels within these institutions. The tension and paradoxes are evident in the relationship between the organizations human resource approach and fixed-term contract employment strategies. Academic arrangement employees working on fixed-term contract are unhappy about the employment conditions and with lack of support from the management. Subsequently the already existing tension between the state administration and this human resource is aggravated.

Given the context of a fragmented and distraught socio-political milieu, there are other factors which contribute to the degradation of these employees. Rampant corruption; degraded ethics on political and social level to torture the weaker;and lack of professional ethics have led to the discrimination and degradation of these employees.The state political actors have not been able to show any permanent stand. Being deceitful to safeguard their own interests they have sometimes labeled theseemployees as inefficient, incapable, and even ineligible which seems to be scapegoating for their own incapability and inefficiency.

Among these employees the new entrants fulfill the current eligibility criteria fixed by the respective managing bodies. Being highly qualified their awards, achievements and teaching at these institutions proves their ability and efficiency. Those employees who are labeled as ineligible (given the changes in eligibility criteria) have fulfilled their eligibility at the time of their entrance into this type of employment. Eligibility criteria depend upon the need of the time. Their counterparts in the permanent contract employees are respected for their experience and are supervising the new entrants coming with higher qualifications and are called as seniors. But the employees on the fixed-term contracts have been rewarded as ineligible for their years of experience, work commitment and continuous investment.

When the fact seems to be that, it is the state administrative failure which couldn't come with any concrete policy to absorb these employees. It is the inefficiency and ineligibility of the human resource management who seem to adopt the Machiavellianism approach, where on the one hand they take the services from these employees on the other hand doesn't even consider them as employees. Their level of participation and recognition is almost none in other activities within these institutions. When there is need, these employees are threatened for disengagement for not taking the demanded tasks and when it is otherwise they are pushed out of the other related service activities, e.g., evaluation, supervision, institution up gradation and development activities, training and orientation courses, etc. Being labeled as inefficient and ineligible, the service of conveying knowledge is made possible through the fixed-term academic staff members.

Given the present social context, where dignity is awarded on the basis of money and power, it adds more to the discrimination and degradation of these staff members especially the female staff, where no considerations are given to the gender issues when it comes to fixed-term contract female employee. The level of job satisfaction experienced by the academic staff members is crucial to the output of qualified and equipped students. It is very important that the authorities and the management of the educational institutions implement policies and procedures to ensure that the levels of job satisfaction experienced by the staff members are high.

There is lack of knowledge and poor management practices regarding this staff category. Motivation and job satisfaction begin with leadership that builds or affirms the people and their value to the institution. So the needs of these staff members must be taken into consideration.

Financial and non-financial motivators are determinants. Feeling of working on something worthwhile and working for a good and reliable organization, where sensitivity towards a work-life balance prevails contributes to motivation and job satisfaction. The system that doesn't take employee needs and quality of life into account, are mainly beaurocratic and task-oriented and don't take personal and interpersonal relationships in a balanced life into account.

The Higher Education Department functions within a set organizational structure having different but interrelated management levels. There must be a specific understanding and delegation of authority and subsequent responsibility within an organization. The concept of authority goes hand in hand with responsibility, and the person higher in the hierarchy will have more responsibility and will be answerable ultimately. The management structure must be made aware of new trends and challenges, which is of utmost importance. If the basic assumptions, goals and objectives of the organization stay the same, no progress will be made and there will be stagnation, and our higher educational institutions are the best example of this stagnation.

Here the management applies the Theory-X (hard approach; ""we versus they"" approach)of human work motivation on fixed-term contract employees and Theory-Y (soft approach; Democratic approach) on permanent-contract employees. Whereas the world is constantly developing, they have moved beyond the Theory-Z (optimal managerial style - cultivating moral and ethical excellence), indicating our backwardness, ignorance, and lack of professional ethics.

When it comes to management even the Scientific Management or Taylorism was considered obsolete by 1930's and a new classical approach known as Human Relations Approach was emphasized. The management should have good human skills. The organization must fulfill their staff's higher order psychological needs. But in this part of the world,we are not able to fulfill even the basic level needs of these staff members.

Employees can be all fired up about their work or can be made working hard. However, if the results of their work do not contribute to the organization and ultimately to the community, then the organization is not any better than if the employees were sitting on their hands and maybe even worse. And this applies to all whether permanent contract employees or the fixed-term contract employees. An organization is only as strong as the individuals associated with it. The higher educational institutions were totally dependent on fixed-term contract staff members till recent recruitment of permanentstaff members. These posts in majority were also filled by the individuals who had been working as fixed-term contract employees. If these candidates are labeled as inefficient and ineligible, it will indicate that the administration and the management are corrupted and are cheating the public. When the fact is that, this staffing trend is increasing given the demand and the lack of resources on part of the educational institutions. Further it can be asserted that the rapid increase of fixed-term lecturers at higher education institutions can be attributed to the relative absence of employment regulation, declining resources with rapid expansion of student enrollments. These factors combine to encourage numerical flexibility with rapid recruitment and the use of cheap and disposable employees given the unemployment and lack of alternative choices to the candidates.

The Human Resource Management division of an organization is directly involved in the implementation of the strategies that are decided by the higher levels. This division must be functional in every institution. It is imperative that this department, which is an integral link between staff members and the management structure of the educational institutions, keep the best interests of both the staff members as well as the organization in mind. The situations need to be managed in order to ensure the continuation of the person as well as the organization otherwise there will further increase in the social problems and disturbances. The number of fixed-term contract employees at various institutions exceeds the number of permanent contract employees. The administrative decisions must be made. There must be policies for these employees in order to ensure their job security and a better quality of life which inturn will lead to the betterment of the society.

The fixed-term lecturers'account for a higher of the overall workforce of higher educational institutions, but no attention is being paidneither by the administration nor by the management into whether these staff members are satisfied with the roles they have, their responsibilities or the rewards they receive.It has been found that the fixed-term lectures often bring first-hand knowledge and experience to the classroom andmany of the fixed-term lecturers bring with them significant awards and experiences. The growing numbers as well as the relative permanence of these lecturers at higher educational institutions show that these institutions rely heavily on the services of these fixed-term contract lecturers and they are imperative to the success of the academic environment.

It is observed that these teachers have been neglected when compared to their permanent counterparts in terms of support and policy. This has resulted in the feelings of being ""at the margin"" amongst them. The administration as well as the management must honestly accept this undeniable fact and must make this human resource feel that ""they matter"" and not that they work ""just to fill the gaps"". Job insecurity; very low salaries with no access to resources and benefits; and no long-term employment options available to themhas resulted in a very strong dissatisfaction with their job environments. Thus, it influences their levels of job satisfaction, and ultimately, the productivity of these lecturers and the higher educational institutions as a whole, which indicates the failure on part of the institutional management and the state administration."

The fate of 70 mentally challenged students studying at the centre, some of whom are also physically disabled, hinges on how the Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society is able to make ends meet.

These students, aged between four and 18 years, belong to economically disadvantaged families whose meagre incomes come from pulling rickshaws, selling vegetables and fruits or working as domestic help.

The Dr Zakir Hussain Memorial Welfare Society has been managing its Child Guidance Centre (CGC) with the help of financial grants it receives under the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment's Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Rehabilitation Scheme. The crisis for the specialised school began when the ministry issued guidelines that from April 1, 2018, the salaries of the staff were to be increased two and a half times or more. This resulted in the annual expenditure on salaries going up from Rs 5.5 lakh to Rs 14 lakh.

""The yearly government funding on which CGC runs is retrospective, that is, the society has to meet all the expenses, including staff salaries, before it actually receives the grant from the social justice ministry,"" explained Baran Farooqi, general secretary of the society. ""This meant that when the ministry hiked the salaries of teachers employed on contract for the project, the society was forced to arrange almost double the amount it used to till 2017-18 in order to meet the incremental expenses.""

Perhaps even the additional finances could have been somehow managed. But discouragingly, the ministry has affected the working of the school by being erratic in the disbursal of grants. In fact CGC is still awaiting the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

What also irks Farooqi is the whimsical manner in which the grants are disbursed. ""Reimbursements are either denied to us on arbitrary grounds or only a fraction of the stipulated amount is released,"" he pointed out. As an example, Farooqi reiterated the failure of the ministry to release the second instalment of grants for 2015-16.

The families of the students studying in CGC do not have the means to send them to any other school. Besides, here they can also get the specialised training required by their mentally challenged ward, such as IQ assessment, counselling, psychological assessment, physiotherapy and reading, writing and speech therapies. These and other measures could mean a world of difference in the way the children receive their education.

The society is more than 40 years old and runs several social service programmes other than this school. Jamia does assist it with space and other necessary infrastructural necessities, but CGC has to manage funds on its own."
