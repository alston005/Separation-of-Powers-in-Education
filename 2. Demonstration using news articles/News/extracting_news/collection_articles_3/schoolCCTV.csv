This comes a day after a Class-VI girl was allegedly raped by the pooled car driver and cleaner. The cops have also demanded details of all the cars and buses ferrying students.

""We have asked all schools to provide us with detailed lists of cars and buses ferrying students. We are preparing advisory for operators, schools, students and their parents. After the Puja, we will meet all the school authorities to ensure the rules are implemented."" said deputy commissioner (headquarters) of Howrah City Police Ranendranath Banerjee.

In Kolkata, the police are supposed to carry out background check of pooled car and school bus crews and bar vehicles that don't meet basic fitness measures from ferrying kids. The instructions issued about six months ago after consultations with transport department state only drivers and helpers whose antecedents have been verified should take the driver's seat. As a thumb rule, rickety vehicles and drivers without a valid licence were not allowed to ferry students. ""While CCTV cameras in the vehicles should be ideal, we want the pooled car association to start a GPS tracking system, especially in cars for lower-primary students,"" said an officer. Citing an example of a vehicle ferrying students being confiscated by the Jadavpur traffic guard at the Sukanta Setu-Raja SC Mullick Road crossing, the police said they had taken action against a dozen such vehicles across Kolkata. ""The pooled car association has always extended a helping hand and supported our move to ensure security of students,"" claimed a Lalbazar officer overseeing the crackdowns.

However, several cops at the different police stations and traffic guards that TOI spoke to claimed vigilance was not always tight. They cited two reasons: punctuality of pooled cars being of vital importance, the vehicles were hardly stopped unless there was a specific complaint and secondly, the crackdown drive had to follow certain mandates laid down by the SC and that was not possible without the transport department joining in.

Pool Car Operators' Welfare Association general secretary Arupam Dutta said, ""We depend on the referral system before appointing a driver and cleaner. We understand the gravity and sensitivity of such cases. But such criminal acts shatter the faith the parents' faith. We want to appoint woman attendants on all school vehicles but there is a demand-supply issue."""

This comes days after a three-year-old girl was allegedly molested in a school bus by the driver and conductor in Nainital's Kathgodam area. The duo was arrested on Friday evening.

A division bench of acting chief justice Rajiv Sharma and Justice Sharad Kumar Sharma gave a slew of directions to the public schools for maintaining a safe environment for the students. The orders came while disposing of a writ petition filed by Aklema Parveen highlighting the 'insensitivity' on the part of the school while dealing with the victim.

The court said that the incidents of molestation are reported frequently and the state administration should have taken necessary remedial steps to address the issue by now.

The division bench further directed schools to make it mandatory for the school buses and vans to have female staff in them.

""Schools must provide their students with GPS enabled identification cards to trace their location. Not just ID cards, but buses and vans should also be quipped with GPS tracker systems,"" the bench said.

Besides, to enhance the safety of students within and outside the premises of the schools, parents should be informed through SMS after picking up and dropping off their children, the court said.

Uttarakhand is known for its renowned public schools located across Nainital, Mussoorie and Dehradun. However, the reputed schools have often failed to maintain security for the students.

Recently, six people, including the staff, from one of Dehradun's well-known schools were arrested for covering up an incident of gang rape of a teenager.

The High Court underlined that the district authorities shall regularly monitor the CCTV footage in private schools and the school management must abide by its directives, otherwise, the court shall recommend cancellation of affiliation of the errant schools."

Close to a month after a three-year-old child was allegedly sexually assaulted in a prominent Greater Noida school, the panel which conducted a magisterial enquiry of the school premises has pointed to gaps in the CCTV system, and stated that CBSE's safety instructions are not being followed completely. It has also drawn a list of 12 suggestions to improve security at the school.

On July 14, a helper at the school's swimming pool was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a nursery student, following which the District Magistrate formed a committee to look into whether the school followed standard safety procedures.

The panel has reported that there is only one CCTV camera in the vicinity of the swimming pool, and it points towards the pool and not the entry to changing rooms. It also pointed out that certain parts of the school are not covered by cameras, and the school lacks a system for monitoring the feed.

According to the report, there are four screens in the principal's office which can switch between footage from four cameras, while the designated monitoring office has only one screen which can display footage from one camera. The report states this is sufficient for random checks but not for continuous monitoring.

It also stated that the school does not have a formal record of its outsourced staff members and that it has not appointed a security or vigilance officer.

Suggestions by the committee include: the school should have dedicated staff to monitor CCTV feed; only female staff should be present in places like toilets and swimming pool; every staff member should have police verification; clear and honest communication between the school management and guardians is necessary.

A two-year old boy allegedly suffered sexual assault in a south Kolkata school on Monday, and his father suspects its management deleted CCTV footage that could shed light on what happened.

IndiaToday.in accessed copies of the man's written complaint, the boy's patient card, and the first investigation report - which lists sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) Act, 2012. The FIR was filed against unidentified individuals.

The boys's father says his wife found him ""crying very badly"" when she went to bring him home from school on Monday. When she discovered, later, that his ""internal parts [were] bleeding"", they sought medical opinion.

""After that night, we visited his doctor, and he mentioned that someone inserted some object in his private part, and his rectum is swollen,"" the father recalls in his complaint. On July 4, he says, another doctor -- a child specialist -- confirmed ""the abnormal behaviour"", and was ""shocked"" and ""stunned"".

According to the complaint, when the boy's parents asked the school's principal for CCTV footage, she told them the equipment hadn't been working properly since June 26.

She said the school didn't have footage from the time period between June 26 and July 2 (Monday), and ""also mentioned that nothing has happened in the school"", the father says.

On June 26, the family and relatives of the seven-year-old rape and assault victim in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, had looked at all possible places she could have gone after school - and even alerted relatives in nearby villages and towns to look for a schoolgirl in uniform - before they approached the police around 8.30 pm to file a missing person's complaint. The family alleged that the girl's school did not want to bring police in the picture.

While the two main accused were arrested the following day, and reportedly confessed to the crime, the police said the family informed them late, which may have affected the search for the girl.

Superintendent of Police (City) Rakesh Shukla, who is leading the special investigation team (SIT) in the case, said police were informed at least an hour-and-a-half late. He said the school could not provide CCTV footage so the police sought footage from shops and houses in three lanes leading to the school.

Kotwali Police Station in-charge J S Yadav also accused the family of reaching the police late. He claimed the police swung into action immediately, beginning by searching the school's washrooms and storerooms to see whether she had fallen asleep. The police checked deras of the Banchhada community, which has traditionally practised prostitution, by alerting police stations and shared her picture with gram raksha samitis (village committees).

Yadav said the police had even passed by the spot, off Laxman Darwaja Road in Mandsaur, where the victim was eventually found around noon on Thursday - raped, her throat slit, and left to die.

Doctors said her condition is fast improving -- she has started eating semi-solid food and walked a few steps on Monday. Dr V S Pal, superintendent of Indore's M Y Hospital, where she is recuperating, told the media that she could soon be moved out of ICU.

Her family said they did not approach the police because they did not imagine anything untoward initially. Her grandmother, who was late in fetching her from school on June 26, said, ""In case I got late she used to wait for me on the bench. When she was not there (that day), I thought someone else -- probably her father or a cousin -- had taken her home.""

But as they failed to trace her, soon nearly 25 or 30 members of the extended family were involved in the search, a cousin said.

""We even checked the last train, and were in touch with acquaintances in Sitamau, Neemuch and Pratapgarh (in neighbouring Rajasthan) through the night... nothing helped,"" the victim's uncle said. He said they could have traced her ""much before if the school's CCTV was working"".

The footage that led to Irfan's arrest on June 27 was sourced only after 2.30 pm, more than two hours after a boy had found the victim walking, dazed. This boy brought her to the road when a man passing by noticed them, and two policemen who were nearby reached them, officers said.

The police learned about the possible suspect through informers. Irfan was taken into custody late that night. Shukla said Irfan was wearing the same shoes as seen on the CCTV footage.

Although the police had also taken Asif, 24, into custody early on June 27, the arrest was made official only on Saturday. The SIT chief said both accused have confessed to the crime."

Three students have been detained after security camera footage showed Tushar Kumar, 16, being punched by his classmates in the washroom in what the police described as a ""dadagiri-type"" fight on Thursday morning.

""The boys had a fight of sorts. They were in the same class and the fight that started in the classroom went on outside. Dadagiri type ka jhagda hua,"" said a police officer.

Tushar was taken to hospital after being found unconscious in the toilet by some students.

The school claims that he had been unwell and died in hospital, but his parents allege that there was a cover-up. ""If he was unwell, why would I send him to school? My son was cold when I touched him. The principal told us he had a stomach ache. He was dead in school,"" said his mother, surrounded by mourners from the family and neighbourhood.

""Bring back my son, they killed my son,"" she wept.

Tushar's parents allege that he was chased and beaten up by the three students and left to die in the washroom. And later, they say, the school tried to shield those involved.

There were no injury marks on Tushar's body, say the police as they wait for a post-mortem to establish how he died. Classmates and students who found him in the toilet have been questioned.

Tushar's family lives in Karawal Nagar in northeast Delhi, not far from his school in the same area. Yesterday, the boy's family members and residents came out on the streets in anger and shouted slogans outside the school, demanding an investigation into his death.

The case has chilling parallels to the murder of Pradyuman Thakur, a Class 2 student of Ryan International School in Gurgaon, who was found with his throat slit in a school toilet in September. The police believe Pradyuman was killed by a senior student who wanted the school to postpone exams and a parent-teacher meeting."
