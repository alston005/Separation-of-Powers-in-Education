States in turn are to reimburse a certain amount of money for every RTE admission.

However, it turns out that the Maharashtra government is looking around for ways to not pay these schools the money it owes them.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Maharashtra, led by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, can claim credit for many successes, especially with the irrigation project Jalyukt Shivar and an impressive infrastructure upgrade topping the list. However, its record on one front has been abysmal, i.e., in fulfilling its responsibility under the Right to Education (RTE) Act.

According to Section 12 of the RTE, non-minority unaided private schools are required to reserve 25 per cent of the seats in entry-level classes (either primary level or Class 1) for students belonging to disadvantaged groups (DGs) [Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), etc] and economically weaker sections (EWS) [income less than a certain amount]. The state in return is supposed to pay these schools, for every RTE admission, an amount fixed by the government or the tuition fee of a school, whichever is less. Maharashtra has fixed an amount of Rs 17,000 a year for RTE students.

But it goes to great lengths to avoid reimbursing this amount to schools. Though the schools have been reserving seats under RTE since 2012, the government tried to get out of its commitment by simply agreeing to pay dues for only one academic year. Then, there was disagreement over the actual amount due and how it should be calculated. The government said it owed Rs 300 crore while the schools said the amount was more than 1,000 crore.

This mismatch in estimates came about because the government wanted to pay only for fresh RTE admissions while the schools were asking to be compensated for all RTE admissions (new and repeat/old students - explained in detail here).

Even to date, the dues of past academic years have not been fully released to all the private schools. Now, the Maharashtra government has come up with a new plan to avoid paying the money it owes to these institutions. In a government resolution released recently, it has modified the norms for RTE reimbursement stating that ""if a private school is using any government land and benefiting from the same then the school would not receive reimbursement for students who have been admitted in 25 per cent RTE quota,"" Mumbai Mirror reported.

Through this order, the government has effectively imposed a retrospective binding of sorts in an agreement that is in force for years and it has done so in a one-sided manner. This is a textbook definition of ""breach of contract"". When the government leased out land, it didn't impose a condition that schools will have to reserve 25 per cent seats for EWS/DG category students. Nor does the RTE Act mandate that those schools that have received land from the government at concessional rates will not be compensated for fulfilling the RTE quota. Hence, both from the RTE Act and the leasing agreement, the government's action is prima facie illegal. Less said about the ethical aspect of its action, the better.

Independent English Schools Association (IESA) secretary Rajendra Singh told Swarajya that ""the government's action is not just illogical but outright illegal. The RTE and land leasing are two separate contracts. In any case, under the RTE Act, the government gives reimbursement for only tuition fees and not for infrastructure costs the school has to bear. Land comes under the latter category. How can the two be clubbed? If the government was paying per student reimbursement for infrastructure costs also, then they had a case. In such a scenario, they could have deducted this from total reimbursement, but how can they not reimburse the tuition fees?""

Singh further explained that the government simply ""doesn't have the data to ascertain how many schools have the land leasing agreement with the government. Nor it has the manpower to determine this number. It will take anywhere between one to two years to collect the data. This is nothing but their latest attempt to delay payments to private schools."""

Reddy who participated in a meeting organised by the Telangana Private Degree and PG Colleges Managements Association and Telangana Private Junior Colleges Managements Association here on Saturday said that fee hike, a long pending demand of junior colleges would be looked into besides affiliation process.

He also promised to work towards having uniform fee structure for all the degree courses offered by the universities in the State and also on spot admissions in degree courses. Reddy said after formation of new State of Telangana, the TRS government has streamlined the fee reimbursement and also created separate accounts for professional and inter, degree colleges for releasing funds.

Fee reimbursement arrears for the academic year 2017-18 have been almost released and the government is ready to reimburse fee for academic year 2018-19.

He reminded the managements that no college of Narayana and Sri Chaitanya were given permission since 2014 and said that in fact 60 of them have shut their shops in the State.

Prof. T Papi Reddy, Chairman, Telangana State Council of Higher Education extended his support in resolving issues of private degree and PG colleges.

During meeting, the degree college managements wanted the government to hike and fix the minimum tuition fee at Rs.20,000 for non-lab courses and Rs.25,000 for lab courses.

They also wanted the government to bring educational institutions under non-commercial slab for electricity beside reduction of municipal taxes. The school managements urged the government to relax norms for obtaining fire and police no objection certificate."

As one of the cool kids at school, I started a coin collection in fifth grade. I remember going on trips to the bank with my mom for rolls of coins to sort through, looking at dates and years to fill in the slots in my blue coin-collecting albums. That, alongside my parents owning a business, sent me on many trips to local banks. But over time, my number of visits to the bank have dropped to zero.These days, I stick with an online-only bank as my primary bank. I don't have a single branch available. While it seemed strange at first, it was easy to grow accustomed to.

Let's look at the pros and cons to help you better understand if you could survive with online-only banking.

Online account offers from our partners:

With online-only banking, you are the teller and new accounts representative for yourself. Instead of going into a bank branch, you handle your own banking transactions from your computer or smartphone - like you could with many traditional banks, too.

Online banking uses secured connections, so as long as you use strong, unique passwords, it's totally safe to bank online. The best accounts allow you to deposit checks from your phone, transfer funds to or from any account at any bank with no fees, pay bills online, and avoid fees common to traditional brick-and-mortar banks.

As long as you get paid via direct deposit or check, as opposed to cash, online banking should easily meet all of your financial needs. Now, let's take a more detailed look at how some of the features work so you understand how the replace your old banking experience.

Once logged in, you can view balances, pay bills, make transfers, and deposit a check with a photo. If you have other accounts at the same bank, such as credit cards, loans, or investments, you can manage and make transfers to those accounts as well.

With online banking, it is easy to have all of your accounts under one roof. But even if you don't, it's easy to manage everything through convenient mobile apps.

The only real downsides of online banking are losing the in-person banking option and depositing cash with a teller. If you have a job where you are paid mostly in cash or tips, like a restaurant server or valet parking attendant, online-only banking probably isn't viable for you.

Taking cash out of an online bank account, though, is easy. Most online banks charge no fees for any ATM access, and some reimburse fees charged by other banks' ATMs. Some popular accounts that offer no-fee ATM access include Ally Bank (up to $10 per month reimbursed) and Charles Schwab Bank (unlimited reimbursements).

To deposit cash, you may want to consider pairing your online banking account with a favorite local credit union. Most credit unions offer a basic no-fee checking and savings option, which you can use to deposit cash and transfer to or from your online bank account.

Even online banks that don't charge fees usually offer a large network of free ATMs. Through memberships in various banks networks, Capital One (39,000 free ATMs), Discover Bank (60,000 free ATMs), and others typically have a convenient location near your work or home.

For example, most big banks charge huge fees for overdrafts. Online banks charge lower fees, if any. Capital One gives you four options for how to handle overdrafts to help you avoid or manage fees. Simple and Chime don't charge those fees at all - in fact, the only fee online bank Simple charges is for foreign debit card use. Otherwise, you won't pay them a cent. Ever.

Capital One and Ally typically stand at the top of the leaderboards in terms of interest rates, but other online banks don't lag far behind. Online savings rates are commonly around 20x better than what you get from the big, nationwide traditional banks.

If the idea of better interest rates, lower fees, and managing your own banking online is tempting to you, online banking may be the right choice.

To get started, you can keep an old account in addition to your new online account, slowly shifting your banking. Alternatively, you can get an online account and keep a local credit union account for physical banking needs. The truly bold dive in without looking back.

Online banking may feel new to you, but it has been around since the early 1980s. It's safe and secure and the future of managing money. As long as you don't need to regularly deposit cash, online-online banking may be a great decision for your money needs.

As you sow, so shall you reap -- is how the proverb goes, and as far as loan waivers are concerned, TOI's headline tells us what it has reaped: ""Loan waiver pledge causes 24 per cent rise in MP farm NPAs"". The report explains, ""Anticipating relief, farmers start skipping repayments, impacting bank finances. Banks, in turn, go slow on fresh loans until state governments reimburse the amount written off, which often happens over several years.""

In the latest data, ""farm-related nonperforming assets in Madhya Pradesh doubled to 10.6 per cent of advances in a little over three years between 2014-15 and June 2018. In just a one-year period ending June, NPAs on farm loans in the state rose 24 per cent, according to the state-level bankers' committee.""

The Indian Express reports on the government's solution to NPAs in the public sector in its lead story, ""To ease their cash crunch, Govt to put in Rs 83,000 crore in public sector banks"". This is to ""increase its capital commitment to partly make up for the lender's shortfall in fundraising from markets"".

The 'Explained' box says that this will eventually lead to growth in the economy, ""This decision enables these banks to step up lending in the economy and absorb some of the collateral impact of stressed assets"".

HT puts the news on its front page flap, choosing to lead with RLSP leader Upendra Kushwaha's decision to join the UPA in the upcoming elections. HT calls their recent alliance ""a shot in the arm"" for the Congress.

TOI editorial says this could spell bad news for the BJP, ""It's possible that BJP's formidable electoral machinery can be defeated through smart alliance building and seat sharing adjustments...The 2015 Bihar assembly polls that resulted in a mahagathbandhan victory against BJP provide a ready-made template for the opposition camp. Thus, BJP simply can't ignore these UP-Bihar rumblings,"" it says.

Also, the Bulandshahr story has also made it to the front page. TOI quotes actor as Naseeruddin Shah saying, ""In many areas, we are witnessing that the death of a cow has more significance than that of a police officer.""

The Express also comments on the matter. ""The killing of a policeman is especially heinous because it violates a central contract on which the state is founded. In a constitutional democracy, a disarmed populace surrenders the capacity for violence to the state...the designated repository of the armed force is the police...their writ cannot be challenged... The killing of a cop violates this contract"" and ""threatens to open the door to anarchy"".

Parliament is in session, or at least it's supposed to be. A headline in the Express reads, ""Amid disruptions, Speaker calls meeting of rules panel"", referring to the constant forced adjournments and disruptions since the session began 8 days ago. A corresponding editorial calls it ""part of a larger crisis of institutions, where personalities and events and power-play have taken primacy over processes and norms.""

Other news

'No check on use of highly toxic pesticide', reads a grim headline in The Hindu. Monocrotophos pesticide is ""sold at subsidised rates to farmers at Raitha Samparka Kendras, is banned on vegetables"", and was the same one used to poison dozens of devotees in Karnataka's Sulwadi temple.

Even grimmer is the death of a Dalit girl who was set on fire, ""A 15-year-old girl from Agra, set on fire while returning home from school on Tuesday...The tenth grader suffered 70% burns, according to doctors and police,"" reports HT.

India Today

India Today anchor Rajdeep Sardesai asked Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot in an interview -- whether farm loan waiver is a solution to agrarian distress or not.

To this, Pilot replied, ""I want to assure everyone that our government will not only maintain but enhance social sector spendings.""

When asked whether it is an election game plan, Pilot said, ""We owe our farmers' loan waivers, cannot see them commit suicides. We are trying to tell the farmers that we are there for you. The country cannot move forward if large sections of our society remain backward.""

When asked about the long-term measures which Congress will take, Pilot said, ""Congress will try to eradicate the cartel of hoarders and black-marketeers, at least I will ensure that in Rajasthan.""

ET Now

ET Now anchor Supriya Shrinate discussed whether Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's Rs 1.06 lakh crore PSB recap plan was a right decision.

The government on 20 December sought Parliament's approval for an additional Rs 41,000 crore for PSB recapitalisation during the current fiscal.

Consulting editor Mythili Bhusnurmath said farm loan waiver will eat into banks' recapitalisation while chief executive of Indian Banks' Association V.G. Kanan mentioned that recapitalisation will help the banks lend.

Bhusnurmath said, ""Farm loan waiver will eat up the recap amount announced for banks and their requirement will increase. Government should have announced PSB recap at starting of their tenure.""

Kanan commented, ""Banks had cases of large corporate lendings going haywire in the past. But banks are now back in the business of lending. This fresh recapitalisation will help them lend now.""

Aaj Tak

Aaj Tak anchor Anjana Om Kashyap discussed what prompted actor Naseeruddin Shah say that he is anxious about his children.

In a short Youtube video put out by Karwan-e-Mohabbat, Naseeruddin Shah has said he fears for his children because they will not have an answer if a mob surrounds them and asks them if they are Hindu or Muslim.

BJP spokesperson Gaurav Bhatia said Muslims are safe in India while CPI-M leader Sunil Chopra said, ""This is true, everyone should fear about the lives of their children now a days. BJP is destroying the nation."""

Royal Enfield, with the Interceptor, showed us that a 650cc twin-cylinder bike can be had for less than Rs 3 lakh and the Ather 450 showed us that electric scooters could be premium and fun to ride. Here's our list of the best bikes and scooters that were launched this year.

Royal Enfield Interceptor 650:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 2.5 lakh

The Interceptor impressed us in many ways. It looks properly authentic with fantastic level of fit and finish. The 650cc parallel-twin motor is refined and with its 270-degree crank offers good low to mid-range performance and a lovely soundtrack. It offers a good balance between ride and handling. In fact, if it were not for the RE badge, you would mistake it for a Honda. The sub-Rs 3 lakh on-road pricing is the icing on the cake.

Jawa:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 1.64 lakh

The revival of Jawa motorcycles has an interesting twist. Unlike the Royal Enfield Classic 350 which carries retro underpinnings and powertrain with a neo-retro design, the Jawa looks properly old-school but hides modern underpinnings and motor underneath. Attention to detail is exquisite and can be seen on the 300cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder motor that has been designed to look like an air-cooled motor. It even gets twin exhaust pipes like the Jawa's of yore.

Yamaha R15 v3.0:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 1.27 lakh

In many ways, the new Yamaha R15 v3.0 is a substantial leap from its predecessor, the R15 v2.0. The new bodywork draws inspiration from the larger R1 and R6 superbikes and looks larger than the version 2.0. It gets modern features like LED headlamp and tail lamps and a full digital instrument cluster. Underneath the deltabox frame, it gets a new and larger 155cc liquid-cooled single. It gets variable valve timing for better performance throughout the rev range and makes 19.3PS, almost as much as the larger 200cc bikes out there. All in all, the track tool for beginners has gotten even better.

TVS Apache RTR 160 4V:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 82,810

The new TVS Apache RTR 160 4V set a new benchmark in the 160cc category. It carries the new Apache design and looks more like the RTR 200 than its predecessor. You have a highly refined 160cc air- and oil-cooled motor that can be had in carburetted or fuel-injected guises. This motor is the most powerful in the segment and impresses with its performance and tractability. The Showa-tuned suspension setup offers fantastic ride and handles well. TVS also offers the RTR 160 with a rear disc brake setup. The TVS Apache RTR 160 4V is a well-rounded package that currently rules the 160cc roost.

TVS NTorq:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 59,712

Sporty 125cc scooters are trending now and TVS sits at the top of that wave with its NTorq. It gets sharp design elements with a front apron mounted headlamp and rear faux air extractors. Features include LED tail lamp and turn indicators and a full-digital instrument console with Bluetooth connectivity. The motor is a powerful unit and propels the scooter to 60kmph in double quick time. It gets 12-inch wheels on both ends with conventional forks up front and a gas charged monoshock at the back. Ride is quite composed while handling is on the sporty side. Braking is quite good too, thanks to a front disc, rear drum brake setup. The NTorq 125 is a sporty scooter but does not compromise on comfort.

Suzuki GSX-S750:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 7.46 lakh

Suzuki launched the GSX-S750 naked sports bike in India this year. The bike comes with a sweet sounding inline-four motor that offers good low-end grunt and tractability. Rider aids include a 3-level traction control and ABS. It handles quite well for its portly size and the brakes offer fantastic bite. In fact, the GSX-S750 offers a user friendly ride experience that is fun as well as forgiving.

Suzuki V-Strom 650XT:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 7.46 lakh

The GSX-S750 wasn't the only big bike launched by Suzuki this year. They also launched the V-Strom 650 to rival the Kawasaki Versys 650. While Suzuki sells two models of the V-Strom 650 abroad, we get the off-road oriented and higher-spec 650XT variant that comes with larger spoke wheels and off-road oriented tubeless tyres. The 650cc V-twin motor offers usable power from low revs onwards which helps a lot while riding off the road. Overall, the V-Strorm 650 is a pretty capable package that should entice ADV riders looking for a capable bike under the Rs 10 lakh bracket.

Triumph Tiger 800:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 11.76 lakh

The new Tiger 800 offers even better long distance riding comfort, thanks to its more upright riding stance. Its updated 800cc in-line triple motor also offers more low-speed grunt for everyday riding around town. It now sounds throatier as well. There is now a larger and more rigidly mounted windshield that does not shake even at speeds close to 200kmph. The party trick though is the full colour TFT instrument console borrowed from the Street Triple RS that is quite comprehensive and easy to navigate via the new joystick on the left side handlebar controls.

Ather 450:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 1.25 lakh

Before riding the Ather 450, we had this notion that electric bikes are slow and built to a cost. Now, the Ather 450 won't set any speed records but its power delivery and performance are eerily similar to the conventional 125cc scooters we are used to riding. The quality of materials, fit and finish and features on the Ather 450 set a new benchmark for scooters in India. Ather also offers a unique after sales in the form of a yearly package that not just covers service and connectivity costs, but also the electricity required to run the bike. Yes, not only can you use their charging stations set across the country for free, they will also reimburse you for the power used by your home charging station.

Kawasaki Ninja 400:

Price (ex-showroom Delhi): Rs 4.69 lakh

Kawasaki has worked really hard to get the Ninja 400 to the top of the sub-500cc sportbike segment and it shows. The new 400cc parallel-twin motor makes more power than the KTM RC 390 and is a proper performer. To harness this, the frame is an all-new trellis unit with a sharper rake and longer swingarm, similar to the Kawasaki ZX-10R. It also gets stickier Dunlop Sportmax tyres. The new Ninja 400 performs well, has sharp handling traits and should be a way superior track weapon than the Ninja 300 it replaces overseas. The only thing going against it is the obnoxiously high asking price.

Odisha's elections are coming up and that is why after 19 years the CM has remembered Odiyas settled in Gujarat. I welcome him to Gujarat,"" Rupani said.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, on a visit to Bhubaneswar on Monday, criticised his Odisha counterpart Naveen Patnaik for his visit to Surat for a programme with the resident Odiya population.

""There are no elections in Gujarat now. Odisha's elections are coming up and that is why after 19 years the CM has remembered Odiyas settled in Gujarat. I welcome him to Gujarat,"" Rupani said.

Surat is estimated to have around seven lakh Odiyas, mostly from Ganjam district, under which Patnaik's own Assembly constituency of Hinjilicut falls.

Rupani also criticised the Odisha government's refusal to join Ayushmaan Bharat. ""The Centre makes programmes for the people's benefit, not for political agendas. I am surprised Odisha is not joining Ayushmaan Bharat,"" he said. ""In Gujarat, we had Amrutum Yojana and Vatsalya Yojana before Ayushmaan Bharat. We used to reimburse medical bills up to Rs 3 lakhs in these schemes. Like Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana (the BJD's programme), we used to serve people and issued cards to 40 lakh people and spend Rs 1,000 crore,"" he continued.

Advertising

""Ayushmaan Bharat will work across the country. However, BSKY or our Gujarat scheme won't work outside our respective states,"" he added.

Rupani's statement about Patnaik travelling to Surat echoed statements made by BJP leader and Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, and Leader of Opposition Narasingha Mishra (Congress), who have questioned the timing of the visit.

Pradhan, who had attended an event by Odiyas settled in Surat along with the Gujarat CM in September, on Sunday had accused Patnaik of ""shedding crocodile tears... because Odiyas in Surat have made up their mind to come to Odisha and Ganjam and remove him from government"".

However, BJD spokesperson and Rajya Sabha MP Pratap Keshari Deb countered these charges, saying, ""Every year, a minister from the government goes to Surat ever since the BJD government was formed.""

On Rupani's visiting Bhubaneswar on the same day that Naveen Patnaik had visited Surat, Deb said, ""The BJP is terrified that Naveen Patnaik has gone to Surat. You are seeing the example that Gujarat CM is in Odisha. Why? It is now proven that it is a trick by BJP.""

Meanwhile, Patnaik, who addressed a huge gathering in Surat, said that all migrant Odiyas would be now covered under Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana, the Odisha government healthcare scheme that provides an annual cover of Rs 5 lakh per family and Rs 7 lakh for women members of the family. ""The scheme is not limited to APL and BPL categories,"" Patnaik said.

He also announced a Rs 10-crore fund for setting up an Odisha Cultural Centre in Surat, and promised to set up a high school for those who have cleared Class X from Odisha education board. ""The sisters and brothers of Odisha have contributed immensely to the development of Gujarat and Odisha,"" he said.

He said he would urge the Centre to start a direct flight from Surat to Bhubaneswar and a direct train to Berhampur.

Patnaik was accompanied by several ministers from his government and at least two dozen filmstars from the Odiya film industry."
