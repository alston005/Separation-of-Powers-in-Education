The association has been alleging several irregularities in the recruitment process over the last one month and demanding that certificate verification be carried out again.

An official from TRB denied all allegations and said the process was conducted fairly.

""While the final list of selected candidates has been released, names of 172 candidates have not been released. They have been kept under a reserved category. The board has not given any explanation,"" said SA Rajkumar from the association.

The TRB had invited applications to fill 1,325 vacant teaching posts in physical education, stitching, drawing and music. Candidates who have a government Technical Examination certificate (higher grade) and Technical Teacher's certificate were invited to apply.

Around 35,000 candidates appeared for the written examination in 2017. Totally, 2,650 were shortlisted. On October 12, the final list was released.

""Names of many less qualified and unqualified candidates have featured in the list of candidates selected for the post of special teachers in government-funded schools,"" said Rajkumar.

""The caste of a certain candidate has been mentioned as SC in the interview call list, while the same candidate is listed under MBC under the final list,"" he said.

It should be noted that the registration fees for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates is half that of the sum for Most Backward Caste (MBC) candidates.

He alleged that another candidate, who was called for interview under a caste reservation was selected under the widow category. ""She was not listed as widow in the interview call list,"" he said.

Candidates who took their exams in Tamil and pursued their education and other exams in Tamil were given a 20 per cent consideration.

Express had already reported on another allegation that many candidates who scored better, were not on the Tamil priority list. They were allegedly asked to produce 'Tamil Medium' certificate for technical exams (including practical work such as stitching and drawing), which cannot be taken in a language, according to an official.

A TRB official said two candidates were called for interview for every vacant position.

""The discrepancy in credentials between the first and second list came from the wrong inputs submitted by candidates in the online applications. We may reconsider certain candidates only if there is a government order in their favour,"" the official said."

Days after arrest warrants were issued against three teachers from Navsari district for remaining absent from Election Commission's electoral roll revision duty, it has come to light that 18 other booth-level officers (BLOs) faced similar action. A majority of these 18 BLOs are school teachers.

Following a report by The Indian Express on September 19 on the action taken against the three teachers from Navsari, the Election Commission of India (ECI) had sought a reply from Gujarat Chief Electoral Officer (CEO).

Arrest warrants were issued against three teachers from Navsari district for failing to turn up for their assigned jobs in the three-day electoral roll revision drive taken up by the ECI for the upcoming general election. Police teams were sent to pick up the three teachers and they were brought to the mamlatdar's office, on last Tuesday.

Confirming the action taken against 18 BLOs, Gujarat CEO Dr S Murali Krishna said, ""A report was sought on September 19 after the Election Commission of India learnt about such an action taken against the BLOs in Navsari district. The office submitted its report to the ECI on the same day. Necessary instructions have been issued to collectors and district election officers (DEOs) to ensure that action against such BLOs is consistent with the Conduct and Discipline Rules framed for Government Employees and only after proper study of legal provision.""

Through the report, it came to light that similar arrest warrants were issued by concerned district administrative officials in five districts -- Gir Somnath, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Dahod and Navsari.

Among these, the highest number of warrants were issued in Khambhaliya constituency of Devbhoomi Dwarka district, where a total of nine warrants were issued against BLOs by the electoral registration officers (ERO) and assistant electoral registration officers (AEROs).

Six warrants were issued from Jamnagar North constituency in Jamnagar district, two from Limkheda in Dahod and one in Somnath from Gir Somnath, all for alleged 'negligence of duty'.

An official statement issued on September 19 by Gujarat CEO Dr S Murali Krishna stated, ""Some BLOs were absent at their respective polling station on 16.9.2018 declared as special campaign day and they were also absent from the training programme for BLOs given by EROs through SATCOM. As such, concerned EROs/AEROs have taken disciplinary actions against such BLOs for negligence of their duty.""

Apart from September 16, September 30 and October 14 are the dates for the special campaign to enrol first-time voters who have completed 18 years of age, and those who want to make corrections in their registered details.

""It has come to the notice of this office that in some cases warrants have been issued against BLOs who were absent. Forthcoming General Elections will be held using electoral roll prepared on the basis of ongoing Electoral Roll Summary Revision Programme. For preparation of updated and error free electoral roll, sincerity of BLOs is necessary. Under these circumstances, action has been taken against BLOs for negligence to their duties with respect to work related to special campaign programme which is of national importance,"" the statement read.

However, the CEO maintained that the action was not consistent with the law. ""Action (issuing warrants) taken by EROs/AEROs is not consistent with the provision of law framed for Government Employees,"" the statement said. Navsari district's Gandevi taluka Mamlatdar (Taluka Chief officer) had issued arrest warrants against three female teachers and instructed police to arrest them immediately.

Police arrested one of the teachers, Nidhi Bharat Patel, as she was taking a class in Antaliya village of the taluka.

Another police team reached Gadat Primary school in search of teacher Geetaben Patel. However, Geetaben, along with another teacher Manisha Raman Patel from Undach Primary School, had gone to participate in a science fair at Vadsarang village.

At the fair, Gandevi BJP MLA Naresh Patel, stopped police from arresting the teachers. The teachers were asked to visit the mamlatdar office in the evening the same day.

The girls who are studying in Class 8 at a private school did not return to their respective homes from the school on Friday afternoon, after which their parents approached the police, an official said.

Mid-term exam results were declared on Saturday and these girls had failed in two or three subjects each, according to their teachers.

After the parents lodged complaints, the police used a drone camera to look for them in the surrounding area, but it did not yield any results.

CCTV footage showed that all five were at Marine Drive in South Mumbai till 2.40 PM, but thereafter they seemed to have disappeared, the police officer said.

Probe was on, he added.

Among those who were found to be ineligible to be Indian citizens are government employees, legislators, teachers and even former president Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed's family members.

For Ataur Rahman Mazarbhuiya, a former All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA for Katigorah, the news of his exclusion was perplexing. ""My family's name is there in the list, and so was mine in the first list. But what happened in the second draft beats me. Surely, this is a conspiracy and negligence of some officer,"" he alleged.

""I talked to the district magistrate who assured me that all my papers were correct, and that he would investigate and check where the lapse took place,"" he added.

Ananta Kumar Malo, the current MLA from Abhayapur South constituency, was also left out of the list. However, the AIUDF leader remained confident the error would be rectified. ""A lot of people didn't figure in the list. It will happen... it will surely happen (the name included in the list),"" he said.

But not everybody was as hopeful.

Sixty-three year old Chitrolekha Das, a retired Joint Director of Public Health in Assam, was also declared a 'foreigner' as her name found no mention in the complete draft National Register of Citizens (NRC).

""I don't understand,"" she said. ""My husband's name is there in the list and so is my sister's and brother's. If this is as vital a document, how did this mistake happen?""

A surprised Das isn't quite sure about what to do next. ""They say I have to file a form. My husband wants me to take legal measures. I don't know what to do,"" she said.

Mohammed Nurul Islam is a government school teacher who was entrusted with weeding out illegal migrants as an National Register of Citizens (NRC) investigation officer. Ironically, even his name was absent from the list -- all because he carries a Doubtful-voter (D-voter) tag.

Fifty five-year-old Islam is among 1,25,333 such persons who are stuck in the family tree verification, a vital part of the updating of the 1951 National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Bhabatosh Chakraborty, a member of SUCI(C) -- a communist party -- too couldn't find his name in the NRC draft. He too was puzzled about how he and his wife were left out of the list while his mother and son figured on it.

Shanta Bhattacharjee, a high school teacher and sister-in-law of former vice chancellor of Assam University,Tapadhir Bhattacharjee felt that the redressal mechanism for those excluded from the list was inadequate.

""It's like a trend. A lot many people in my neighbourhood have one of their family member's name missing from the list. How is this human error justifiable and why there wasn't any provision (in the NRC list) of rectifying such an error?"" he asked.

Another notable miss was that of the family members of India's former President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. The family of Fakhruddin's brother Lt. Ekramuddin Ali Ahmed, who hails from Rangia in Kamrup district of Assam, was shocked to find that they were not on the NRC list.

""Since my father's name is not in the list, we are a little worried about it. Now I need to talk with the elders in my family,"" said Ziauddin, son of Ekramuddin, adding that he would try to find documents to make it to the NRC list.

Azad Alam, the Vice Chairman of Municipality Board in Sivasagar was also left out despite completing all formalities.

""My father joined the ONGC in 1964. I have submitted all the documents. I am from here only. My sister's name is also there. My name will surely appear.""

In Sivasagar, the constituency he is from, a total of 12,350 people's name has not been mentioned in the list.

Those people whose names didn't figure in the final draft could file for claims and objections in prescribed forms in their respective Sewa Kendra from August 30 to September 28."

The council members claimed they were not consulted before drafting the agenda and hence several ""important issues"" were being missed.

Among the proposals tabled for approval before the EC members were several building projects with their estimated cost like Rs 3 crore for the renovation of old viceregal lodge's kitchen, that houses Vice-Chancellor's office, and creating a new statutory authority, namely Director North Campus. ""Several pressing issues like absorption of adhoc teachers, self-finance courses and the e-procurement procedure for any work, did not get even a mention on the agenda list,"" said Rajesh Jha, an EC member and a professor at Rajdhani College. Jha was among the teachers who demanded these issues to be included in the agenda.

""It has become really difficult for colleges across the university to go ahead with any development work after the e-procurement procedure was introduced in 2016. We demand the implementation of simple General Financial Rules (GFR) as it was before,"" Jha added. In 2016, DU had made it mandatory for all colleges to follow e-procurement for any work with a budget of than Rs 15,000.

The council members also raised the issue of DU's School of Journalism. ""The school of journalism is working with two contractual teachers for 128 students. How will they do justice to their jobs?"" asked another member while raising the issue at the meeting, including Vice-Chancellor Yogesh Tyagi.

The members also questioned the rationale behind creating the new post of Director North Campus. ""The university could not even fill all the sanctioned posts from long. They even failed to appoint a full-time pro Vice-Chancellor in the last two years,"" said AK Bhagi, another EC member and an assistant professor at Dyal Singh College.

Meanwhile, the long-pending appointments of 126 assistant professors in DU's law faculty were announced during the meeting. The meeting was on till the time this report was filed."
